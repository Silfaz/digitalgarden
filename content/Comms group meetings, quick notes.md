## 2023-06-25 - Suggestions for summer field trips

### Concept
- Meet at station/bus stop
- Go together to a place
- Walk together around (2ish hours), possibility of picnic, fika
- Go back together
- Have a good time, chat, take photos, experience nature, use public transport

### Destination suggestions
1. **Rååns dalgång** Bus nr. 1 från Hbg till Råå (15 min), vandra längs med Råån to Gantofta (7 km, so approx. 1.5 h), mycket vacker, fika i "Dalstugan" (https://www.facebook.com/people/Dalstugan/100063733681548/) i Gantofta, Pågatåget från Gantofta till Hbg. https://helsingborg.se/uppleva-och-gora/friluftsliv-och-motion/naturomrade/raans-dalgang/. Between Råå and Raus the path includes a fence ladder and walking through a sheep field, so if someone doesn't feel comfortable with that we can also walk along along the road to Raus, and then swing into Rååns dalgång. Southern side of the river is a bit trickier to walk, northern side is suitable for prams and rullstol. Trains back from Gantofta every hour at :17 (takes 11 min). Path goes past Raus kyrka and Görarps mölla. https://media.helsingborg.se/uploads/networks/1/2015/03/broschyr_raans_dalgang_rev2013_sbf.pdf
2. **Örby ängar** Buss 219 (20 min) eller tåg (8 min) från Hbg till Rydebäck, vandra längs kusten/ Örby ängar, många cafeer på Råå, buss nr. 1 till Hbg. Possibility of dipping into the water on the way back. There's also a hundstrand. Hang out a bit longer there if wanted, take bus back to HBG whenever you want. https://media.helsingborg.se/uploads/networks/1/2017/05/nr_orby_angar_broschyr.pdf Örby ängar are the most species-rich nature area in Helsinborg. Path is very easy, but quite exposed. So bring sun protection!
3. **Hilleshögs dalar** Pågatåg to Glumslöv and walk down Hilleshögs dalar. Either take left along the coast to Borstahusen and find nice restaurants. https://www.skaneleden.se/en/item/vandra-med-vy-over-oresund/whvgvq1t0fdgyuhxk3qf1gawlvuymtsd. 
4. **Landborgspromenaden, Sofiero** Meet at Söder, walk along Landborgspromenaden to Sofiero. Fika somewhere there (Sofiero Gård, but costs entrance. Brödkultur? Or just somewhere). Bus 220 back to Helsingborg C. 
5. **Mölle** Buss 220 till Höganäs, byte till buss 222 mot Mölle (54 min! And bus to Höganäs is often very full!). Kliv av vid Krapperups slott, vandra genom den vackra slottsparken och bokskogen ner mot Lerhamn och därifrån längs strandängar mot Mölle. Gott om fika- och lunchmöjligheter i Mölle. Buss 222, byte till 220 i Höganäs tillbaka till Helsingborg.
6. **Domsten-Höganäs** (11 km along Skåneleden, easy) https://www.skaneleden.se/en/etapp/5-hoganas-domsten Take stadsbuss 8, 25 min to Domsten N. Then walk along Skåneleden towards Höganäs. Coastal paths, through gnarly pine woodlands to the town of Höganäs – famous for its ceramics and 200 million-year-old footprints, and then to the fishing village of Viken. This stretch of trail includes coastal heathlands and sand dunes where the vegetation is truly special. Bus back from Höganäs (bus 220, 36 min). Includes Grå Läge naturreservat https://helsingborg.se/uppleva-och-gora/friluftsliv-och-motion/naturomrade/gra-lage/
7. **Helsingborg-Ramlösa-Råå** Walk along Landborgspromenaden/Skåneleden from Helsingborg via Ramlösa brunnspark to Råå (10 km?). Easy to walk, mostly along roads and wide paths. In Råå, possibility of dipping into the sea. Bus back from Råå to Helsinborg C (Stadsbuss 1, 17 min). 
8. **Söderåsen** Go to entrance Skäralid
9. **Dalby Söderskog**

### Audience
Be in contact with on a regular basis
1. General public in Helsingborg
2. Members of HKA
3. Active members of HKA


Different means of communication, different language, different topics

Internal, overview 

### Language
What languages should we post in? (--> will be part of style guide?)
Backgrounds of people in Helsingborg: Indian, Moroccan, Egyptian, Syrian, Ukrainians

#### Team of translators :
Swedish, English, (standard) Arabic, Russian

--> call on them for longer and more "official" communication, e.g. 

### Our presence online
Our plan: Do less stuff well rather than a lot of stuff badly.


Instagram: 432 followers
Newsletter to all members
Linkedin: useful esp. for coporate collaborations (be tagged in their posts), official organisations
Facebook group


### Comms teams projects
- Newsletter (regular) going to all signees: sketch out a rough structure
- Social media activities, ongoing --> analysis, proposal **Luciane**
- Revamping websites: look at things that are not ideal, how to improve the text **everyone**
- Visual styleguide: colours, fonts, logo, language  **Duncan**
- Define transport focus --> needs more guidance from board to define that better. Align with municipality so that we can amplify rather than duplicate. 




#### Next steps
- Communicate our meeting notes to the active members (start with Messenger, then later maybe a dedicated mailing) **Silfa**
- Set up a content calendar, including important local and global dates (e.g. international sustainable somthing something day) **Anna** 
- Set up an image bank (or is there an existing one?)
- Reach out to students (communications, sustainability), middle of February, who wants to help us with our social media presence --> go to lecturers, speak to communications/sustainability students to present HKA
- Reach out to HKA members if we have the skills for e.g. webdesign


### Meetings & communications in the comms team
- 17:00-18:30, first Monday of the month
- Whatsapp group --> **Silfa** will set up
