I've been into fermented, sour foods my whole life, I LOVE them. It's good to make something that you love. 

Is Oatly just another oat milk company? Currently cool, but not the only one out there. 

Would be ideal to combine a lab job (like Oatly) with doing some fermented food production and courses on the side --> "demand" from Oatly to be able to keep the enskild firma on the side. 

No one in Gothenburg and around is doing tempeh and fermented food production. This seems like an obvious gap. There are people who found new successful companies in a much more saturated market. 

Fermentation in food production has a crazy boom right now, it would be silly to not try to get in on this? 

If Mycobrewery, I could stay much better in the alternative protein field that I am most interested in. With Oatly I'd be IN the field, but in a much narrower field. 

Capacity to look into other more exciting applications at Oatly? Cheese, "meat", etc.? Would that be me doing that?

Free evenings and weekends to do things I love sound very nice. With an own business I would probably always do something for it. 

Would having a business in GBG make us "stuck" even more here? Do I want that? 

New adventure to live in a different place. How long is it going to be? If we don't like it, we come back after 2-3 years and have our nice apartment left. Think of Helen, it doesn't fee like she's been away for 3 years.
