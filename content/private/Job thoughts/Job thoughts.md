**Some questions to ask yourself when taking on a new project:** (from https://twitter.com/TaylorPearsonMe/status/1318653822890315778)
1. If you didn’t make any money, would you still have had a great time?
2. Imagine having a conversation at the last cocktail party (or even better, actually have one) do people’s eyebrows raise and say “cool"
3. Does the project leverage your unique ability? Why are you uniquely qualified to do it?
4. Do you respect your customers? Would you be happy to see one if you were walking down the beach on vacation?
5. Does this solve a pain point people already know they have? I.e. Can you sell this without need to re-educate the market? If not, can you position it that way?

**Pros/enjoy/know and cons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know of future job scenarios**

**Oatly**
Pros/enjoy/know:
Well known company, seems like a good place to work, good products, can identify with their vision, want to be involved in developing it further, I know some employees and they all seem very nice and happy to work there, lab would be well equipped, good connections, everyone wants to work with Oatly (-> easy connections to academia and other companies), hands-on lab work, "basic" research and not only connected to new product development, near Malmö/Copenhagen (-> better connected to rest of Europe, trains, flights), involves me even more in alternative protein segment and increases my chances of developing further in that area, prestigious, closer to where things in food/fermentation/enzyme research are happening (Copenhagen, Netherlands, Lund, etc.), good pay and possibility to save up a considerable amount. Better possibilities of visiting family, exploring new cities, Duncan can have more connections in Copenhagen and Malmö and expand his network. We could try living in the countryside/small town for a bit, if we wanted to (might require a car...). 

Cons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:
Moving hassle, very enzyme-focussed (-> away from fungi and fermentation topics), probably not compatible with building up the Mycobrewery more,  potentially long commute (depending on where we live), possibly needing  a car (?), corporate interests, confidential information (instead of open source), probably not easy to work from home or be very flexibel with work hours/place, more away from home. 

Where to go after that job? What would be possible in Gothenburg then? 
RISE, Mycobrewery, Chalmers, some other (food producing) company. Maybe travel around a bit after this job with the money I earned there?

Which skills would I develop that I don't already have? 
Industry knowledge, connections in the enzyme and alternative protein field, very in-depth oat knowledge that is definitely of interest for other areas (-> allowed to work with oat products in other companies after that?).


**VTT**
Pros/enjoy/know:
Job description sounds like the perfect combination of fungi research and alternative protein research, well-known research institute, half-way between academia and industry, good connections, new environment (Espoo/Helsinki) is exciting, probably well-equipped lab, seems like typical research job, probably possible to work on Mycobrewery things on the side, make better connections with fungi researchers (I already know a few there), probably relatively easy to leave after 2ish years, I know that I like the lab work and there would be interesting research projects to work on. Best way to (continue to) work with cellular agriculture, alternative proteins (e.g. egg white protein in Trichoderma), would set me up very well to continue a career in cellular agriculture and improving food production systems towards a more sustainable way. 

Cons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:
"Just another" research job? Would it be a good career step? Might involve an annoying amount of grant applications. Other cons of typical research jobs: failed experiments, publishing, wasting a lot of (plastic) material. Moving hassle, unknown environment, Finnish (after just getting good at Swedish), probably no effort to integrate too much in Finland, bit bleak (?). I don't really want to do some incremental research about making a yeast a bit more efficient in producing a certain protein. I also don't want to work for others to spin start-ups out of the knowledge. 


**Mycobrewery**
Pros/enjoy/know:
Doing my own thing, trying out something new, doing something that I admire in others, many collaboration possibilities (with restaurants, entrepreneurs, companies, shops), pushing myself, flexible work circumstances, prioritise what I think is important, create my own schedule, possibility to try many different ideas at the same time and see what works, good time to do it (now that not too many people are doing something similar yet), supportive environment, not much to lose. Can shape in how I want to contribute to the world. Do something that I think is important, interesting and fun. There will always be a "normal" job to take on if the Mycobrewery doesn't work out. I am in quite a unique position to try something like that out (scientific background, financial freedom, good network). I would learn A LOT, from customer relations to food safety, from sales to marketing to the actual food fermentation. Very varied: fermentation research, course planning, product development, experiments, label design, collaborations. I already know a few people who are super enthusiastic about it, and I will probably get to know more. I can stop at any time or make it a "side thing" for a while if I want/need to. Staying in Gothenburg and keeping our circle of friends. Contributing to the community here. Can take on other work as well, since I have a way to invoice people. 


Cons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:
Many uncertainties: How much will I enjoy it vs. how much will I fret over every decision? Can I chill out enough to take it as a fun experiment (for a limited amount of time)? Is it acutally a good/viable business model? 
Lonely work (no team), every decision is up to me in the end, lot of hustling (selling, advertising, finding customers), possibly a lot of initial investment, risky, very location-bound (at least initially), a lot of administrative work that I have to do (insurance, taxes, food safety, etc.). A lot of manual, repetitive work (making the food products). I don't (yet) feel confident enough to go to restaurants and try to sell them my stuff. Responsible for consequences of my products. Less security: social insurance, sick leave, parental benefits, pension, savings. Not much money for at least 3 years. Might not work out at all. No "sophisticated" research part, i.e. not really involving a lab and a deep research question. Would it lead me too much away from science and being a scientist/researcher? Is there too much competition already? So many unknowns. 
Should I rather take the chance to move somewhere and try something for  a few years before having a more "settled" job?
In a way not as "cool" as other research jobs, e.g. working on transforming the food production system to be more sustainable (animal-free egg and milk proteins, etc.).


**Various consultancy work in GBG**
Pros/enjoy/know:
Possibly varied (working on different projects over time), can continue to work on Mycobrewery for a while, using different skills, good pay, staying in GBG and keeping our circle of friends. Least "invested" option of all, I would probably not be too tied to whatever company I work for, which leaves freedom to let work be work and do other things in my free time. 

Cons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:
Not much say in what I work with, might not be what I would choose to do myself (e.g. Astra working with animal testing, etc.). Questionable how much I could develop my skills (in a structured way). Probably no food-, fermentation- or alternative protein-related tasks.
