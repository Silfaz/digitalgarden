Cirkulär currently has 7 employees, 5 of which are full time:
- CEO Eric Öste
- COO Jeanna
- 3 lab researchers
To be recruited (in Sep 2023) a CFO, starting at 20% and ramping up. 

### Cons
- Fishfeed is not the most exciting product, or something that I truly believe in. Making it from fungi is better than grinding up food, but yeah...
- Going back to something that was already tricky at Mycorena: collaborating with a papermill that has never seen a microbial process, dealing with dirty and potentially toxic side streams, separating the mycelium and turning it into something appealing for the customer. Then the customer wants HUGE amounts to even run trials.
- Only runway money for 1.5 years (until end of 2024). 
- Do I actually miss fungi fermentation so much? It's messy, it smells, it gets contaminated. Do I like the idea of a "fungal future" more than the actual process?
- Another start-up. Even though Eric seems more sane than Ram, the fact is that working at start-ups, especially if I'm responsible for the technology to work, is really stressful. I won't have the same "going home and switching off" that I have at Oatly now. 
- Having to quit Oatly is stressful - I know that shouldn't keep me from doing it, but it does feel like I'm letting very nice colleagues hanging. 
- Less time for hobbies and "extracurricular" things. (Or is it? I will still have weekends and holdidays, right?).
- Probably less pay (or let's say equal to Oatly). Though I wouldn't accept it if it was considerably lower. But how would I feel as the most highly paid person in the company? Mega pressure to make things work!
- Is Eric a "rich kid" that just wants to have a start-up too?
- Awkward to work in a similar area as Mycorena again? And potentially be less successful?
- No more plans for casein production or other precision fermentation - just bulk mycelium for animal feed. 
- Risky to use waste streams - shouldn't the goal (also of the producer) be to reduce them as much as possible. (but that's not as easy as it sounds. Priority for waste-stream producing company is still to make their primary product in the best way). 
- Regret to have given up a very good job at a very nice company. 
- I have not seen anything concrete about Cirkulär. No product, no IP, no strain. What's their USP?
- There have been other companies before that try to make fungal fish feed from lignocellulosic waste. Why is it that they haven't succeeded? Is it because it's just very hard? Or that the time wasn't right? Pekilo was developed in the 70s! Lars' old patents with Rhizomucor were from the 90s! Why have all these processes been put on shelves again?
- Does it look like I can only ever stay 2-3 years at a company? That I get bored quickly and am not loyal to my employer?
- I don't really believe in a grand future for this company.
- Need to set up a lot of things from scratch again - the lab, the processes, the documentation. 
- Working again for a company that "begs" more than it gets asked. 
- Fermentation processes run on their own time. I would have to completely set my time to that clock. 
- It's dirty, it's uncomfortable, it's messy, stinky, doesn't work half the time, gets contaminated, maybe toxic, yucky, slimey, spores, etc. 
- Do you remember all the struggles and problems at Mycorena concerning fish feed? It has to be super balanced in nutrients, super cost efficient, deliver in huge quantities, it has to be better than current solutions, it can't vary in quality or composition, it has to be dried and stable. Separating the mycelium from anything fibrous is impossible. The mycelium has to be dried (immensely energy-intensive and tricky) so it doesn't start rotting, then milled finely into a powder or granulate. Fish are picky and the fish feed needs to sink, not float. Sulphur and other toxic compounds in the feed are a no-go. Drying the mycelium makes a miniscule amount out of a quite substantial lump - most of fungi is water. 



### Pros
- Working with fungi and fermentation again. I like the idea of having that area as "my" area and want to part of creating new ways of using fungi (and other microbes). 
- My way in to gain some more working knowledge in the fungi, fermentation and alternative protein field (because it's still the area that I want to pursue in my career).
- Good to dare something. Oatly is "too safe" (is that a bad thing?), all of my colleagues have families. I have the possibility to do something a bit less normcore. 
- Possibility to work on different fungal strains, plan and run experiments, make mutations, collaborate with university? (What's the situation with Yvonne like?)
- Using waste streams in a good way is important and is something I think should be done. Good market as well - every company wants to use their waste streams in a good way and even pay for it. 
- My prospective role sounds quite appealing: lead a small team, develop the technology, bridge the gap to commercial, dig into the science of it, design experiments, etc. 
- Fungi are cool
- Even if this doesn't work out great after 1-2 years, I will have gained more skills than I would have developed at Oatly, in an area that I want to develop in. 
- Allows me to strengthen my profile in this field. Even if in 2 years I leave and look for other things, it would have been a good addition to my CV.
- Possibility of shaping the path of the company. 
- Better position to be included in funding applications (with universities and other companies)?
- I love digging deep into a subject and then try out things. I want to have a reason to really look into how we can use fungi for all kinds of things and be an expert in it. 
- I can choose to a large degree how much I want to be hands on in the lab, and how much I delegate to the lab engineers. 
- Connections with people in the field, like former Quorn and Enough people, professors, Borås, Rise, Lund university. 


### Questions
- What other areas could Cirkulär expand into (besides animal feed) - food? Waste stream detoxification?
- What's the status of mycelium grown on lignocellulosic waste? Is it problematic because of e.g. sulfite compounds --> look into that. Pekilo process, publications, etc. 
- What's the USP? Is it a particularly good strain (proprietary?), or a specific way of running the process? Or is it just that no one else is doing it and they are in that niche?
- Possibility of working from home?
- Definitely no weekend work expectation and no problem taking holidays?
- Can I support the continued exploitation of animals by making more "sustainable" food for them? But if it's for pets - we always want pets. We don't want animals killed to feed our pets. 
- Can I support the greenwashing of companies that suddenly have an easy way to get rid of their waste streams? And the greenwashing of companies that now have "sustainable" fish feed?
- Does providing more sustainable fish feed mean that in turn eating farmed fish is more attractive? Do I want to work in cleaning up another industries dirty practices?
- If I really want to go into fungi fermentation, why don't I look for a job e.g. at Novozymes or some other larger company that has already figured out how to do it properly? Rather than trying to re-invent the wheel, trying to do everything yourself, struggling with basics that are solved problems in the industry. 


### Other thoughts
- I will never found my own start-up, so joining one that allows me to experiment around is the closest I would get to that. It does allow for possibilities for experimentation around the core business idea - what else could we use fungi for? 
- What's more important for me: to risk something for maybe more excitement but also more work and engagement. Or to keep a good, stable situation going and enjoying the time and peace of mind I have on the side. - Knowing me, I would go all in and get very stressed when the pressure is high. And the pressure will be high, because in a technology-based start-up, the technology is all there is!
- What would be a better opportunity to change the Oatly job? What would make me leave the Oatly job? A more exciting company? Something food-related? Something in Gothenburg?
- If everything goes well with Cirkulär, (or even if it doesn't) it will probably mean travelling around a lot to different events, customer meetings, pilot trial visits, site visits, etc. I don't want to need to drive and I don't really want to fly around either. 


### Pre-mortem
#### Worst case
Cirkulär doesn't really have a functioning technology. One of the two research engineers quits after a few months, the other one is completely overworked. I need to come up with a fungi that works well, but the lab resources are quite tight, we struggle with contamination and having the right conditions for good fermentations. We promise our customers great production rates, but can barely reach them in the lab. The pilot plant in Nymölla is being built and we have to run it several times a month, staying there and going back and forth. It's a struggle without a car and I feel pressured into driving there. The people at the paper mill are not super cooperative, the process doesn't really work. Especially separating the wet biomass, then drying it and We manage to produce a tiny amount for some feeding trials, but it doesn't look like it's a good feed anyway. Fish farmers immediately want volumes we can't dream of delivering. The mood is low and stressful. I feel like a failure and feel immense pressure to deliver. I want to quit but it's an awkard situation after just a relatively short time. I regret leaving Oatly and a nice working environment behind. I haven't had time to do anything outside of work for months. 


#### Best case
I have a small and ambitious team. We conduct interesting experiments both by growing different fungi on different waste streams, and also trying to mutate and screen to develop new strains. We have good access to equipment through the university and it's also nice to form new connections and potential collaborations. The pilot trials and Nymölla proceed well, resulting in decent amounts of dried mycelium that performs well in fish feeding trials at SLU. Fish farmers are interested and are happy to receive small quantities to test. After successful tests, they want to co-fund larger production places to upscale the technology and produce more mycelium in various production places all over Sweden, as well as outside of Sweden. Me and the team travel to these different places to set up the experiments, hire and train new people. We produce more and more fish feed that replaces fish meal and allows for fish farming without fishing the oceans empty. After a few years at Cirkulär I have gained a lot of experience and connections in the fungi and fermentation fields and look for a new position at a food-focused company, as well as a guest professor or part-time position at a university. 




## Oatly



### Cons
- The redundancy made me really feel that employees are expendable. Not a nice feeling. 
- Some clouds on the horizon: mega focus on profitability (but does that really impact my work so much?), maybe another "restructuring" in the future
- Many work tasks that are not really my area (lab planning, factory trials, endless B12) - I was hired for enzyme technology work. Not very scientific questions that I can dig into - either no time or not the priority. (or am I expecting too much? It's not university)
- Probably the last chance to join Cirkulär - (when) will there be another opportunity for me to join a fungal/fermentation company? My skills are not getting any better at Oatly, and the time that I can still claim some credibility from my Mycorena or university times are also fading. 
- No university connections (at least for me). 
- I feel like I'm still in tier 2 of our scientific team. There are people involved in university research and patent applications, and in more business-critical projects (but would I want that?). 
- I don't really get any connections outside of the company. Hard to build a network that might help me later on. Hard to get connections to university researchers. 
- A lot of nutrition focus, which is not my primary interest (and also annoyingly controversial).




### Pros
- I still consider it a very nice working environment. There are so many nice things established: the culture, the striving for sustainability that's embedded in every decision, a true feeling of caring for employees.
- Nice to work for Oatly. People know it and like it. I LOVE the products and am proud to work there. 
- Good boss. Karin is not super proactive, but she listens and never puts pressure on me. Understanding, supportive, calm. 
- It's nice to have varied work and learn new things - which I still constantly do. Maybe not in areas that I would necessarily choose (e.g. how to run a factory trial), but still useful. And I can't complain that my work is too repetitive - there is still a lot of variation in the tasks that I do. 
- Good pay, good holidays, good work hours, good colleagues. Nothing really to complain about. A job that I can keep for a long time and have enough time and headspace on the side for a lot of my other interests.
- I like it when things are set up nicely, and when there are competent people doing their part. That's very much the case at Oatly. It's nice when things are in place, when not everything has to be done by yourself, when you can ask for help or refer tasks to people. 
- Nice to work with food - everyone can relate to it and has positive connections with it. 
- Good to have skillful coworkers with a lot of experience. I don't have to look for those people first, I can just write them an email and ask. 
- I am cared for as an employee: I get a laptop, a phone, a screen, headphones, fika, friskvårdsbidrag, etc. Would I have to use my own laptop and phone at Cirkulär?
- I am quite lucky in that I don't need to have a car, it's possible to commute to work, I don't have to travel much for work. 


### Other thoughts
- My future work timeline for Oatly right now looks like: 
	- Gurt factory trials - somewhat exciting but also repetitive
	- More gurt development - could be fun, especially if it's more like probiotic or high fibre gurt, and not just high protein 
	- Probably some more B12 work - yaaawn
	- High fiber + enzymations - that's nice. I can use my enzyme knowledge, do some lab work, refresh my plant cell wall knowledge, discuss with Fran and run some experiments.
- Other options, beside Oatly _or_ Cirkulär: Find a different job in an area I like, use my free time to develop those skills, keep up to date with research I want to move into. 
- I like to have a thing that's mine. I want to specialise a bit more than doing this and that.
- What am I more passionate about: Working on sustainable food or working on using fungi to produce all kinds of things? Fungi are a bit hyped right now, and they are not the perfect solution for everything. Sustainable food production is definitely one of the most important things to work on.
- I could really intensify my private interest into fungi again. I don't need to work in a field that I'm passionate about, I can also be knowledgable about it and experiment with it in private. Of course there are some things that are not possible, like a proper lab setting and bioreactors, truly sterile conditions, ordering certain chemicals and strains, etc. But sometimes it's good to not make an interest into a job. 


### Pre-mortem
#### Worst case
I stay at Oatly and the next year is a bit of a slog. 


## Different Silfa's future scenarios

### Enzyme and food tech
I stay at Oatly for some time longer. Skills I develop further are in areas of enzyme applications, food production, nutrition, fibres, probiotics, cereals. I continue to work for bringing milk alternatives to more people. The new research centre in Lund is nice to work in. I also spend office days partly in the Malmö office and enjoy a nice walk home after work. I travel a few times to other production places or suppliers, have external collaborations. I have quite a lot of free time where I develop other skills, am active in local organisations, ferment on the side, volunteer, join a urban gardening community. After a few more years at Oatly I look for a job in the enzyme industry (Novozymes), a starter culture company (Chr. Hansen), another food producer (maybe another alternative dairy company) or a precision fermentation company (Remilk). 


### Fungi and resource management
I start at Cirkulär. Skills I develop further are fungi fermentation in larger scale, screening, mutagenesis, genome editing, waste/resource management, mycology. I work on developing fungi fermentation further, make use of unused resource streams in different industries and run feeding trials on fish in collaboration with universities and fish farmers. I travel quite a lot to different potential customers, collaborators, visiting sites, checking pilot runs, etc. My work is very varied and exciting, high energy and takes up most of my brain space. The team is young and excited. After a few years at Cirkulär I look for a job in another fermentation company, either one that makes fungi mycelium for food (Quorn, Enough), a precision fermentation company or continue my work along the resource management path to work on circularity and reducing side streams going to waste. A part-time position at university allows me to be involved in new research projects. My skills are also in demand for various advisory positions and consultancy.






## State the facts

- Fish feed is not what I want to be working on - if that's the only or main product for now.
- What other direction would be appealing?
	- Food - not really, don't want to be in competition with Mycorena.
	- Pet food
	- Resource use 
- Start ups eat your life - I don't mind if my own research eats my life, but not someone else's thing.

## Email

Hi Eric,

Great to hear about the prospective collaborations with Ian and Rob. I'm sure they will be great assets to Cirkulär.

And thanks again for the time you spent the other day to explore whether there would be a role for me in your team. After having reflected at length over the weekend I have come to the conclusion that it wouldn't be the right fit for me at this time. Working at Cirkulär would offer me the opportunity to get more into fungal research again and help grow the technological part of the team, both of which I would be excited about. But the company's current product direction does not really align with where I want to put my efforts right now, and so it's with reluctance that I will have to decline your kind offer of coming in next Tuesday for the assessment day.

I greatly appreciate the time you've spent so far on our conversations, and I'm really excited to see where you take the company in the future. I will be following your journey with great interest, and wish you success with the next steps.

Let's stay in touch,

Silvia
