# Discussions with people

**Josh, 31-08-2020**

-   Starting small and defined is good, e.g. focus on making tempeh and getting it out there (to some restaurants, e.g. Hagabion, Alkemisten, Llama Lloyd, Blackbird, Materia). Then build on this brand for more things.
-   Starting off in an already food-grade place is good. A lot of craft breweries have some capacity that they might be happy to rent out. Vega has a nice kitchen that they currently use only for Fridays and Saturdays. `—> contact Magus, maybe there might be even some collaboration possible? Smoked tempeh?They smoke a lot of things themselves.`
-   Yes Box in Gamledstaden is good for pre-info about starting business. He'll send me more info about which agencies were useful and which ones not so much.
-   Handelsbolag is easier to start up, no initial money needed.
-   Building a space/hub for innovative food and sustainability-related products is good for companies that want to develop something —> collaborations, consultancies, etc. At the same time you can make a name for yourself in terms of being the expert and use that for more consultancy work. There are similar projects in e.g. London [Greenla](https://www.greenlab.org/)b, who provide an experimental space/open lab and subscriptions.
-   Making money with courses is possible, but Gothenburg is not super big, you might run out of people. However, hen nights and company events are always something that's wanted. Basic Theory Ferments: woman won previously the Scottish Beer Brewing award, but then went back to her home in the Netherlands and is now making her own [fermenting everything business](https://www.basictheoryferments.nl/).

**Ram, 01-09-2020**

-   Ringön will be empty from Nov2020 onwards, but they have to keep the lease until 2023. They were thinking about doing a fermentation academy.
-   He was quite enthusiastic about the concept of my "fermentation hub", even (or also because) it's not targeted on profit and scale-up, but more on innovation and community. He suggested renting Ringön from Mycorena and starting the fermentation hub as a collaboration or spin-out from Mycorena, with the backing of Mycorena, but still independently. In that way the premises could be used for courses, open lab, events, food production, trials, etc. The connection with Mycorena could stay purely support focussed with the benefit of maybe taking good people to be employed at Mycorena or using the fermentation hub for grant applications with mutual benefits. He suggested 2-3 months rent free, then also 5-6 months rent free.
-   Pros: Established facility (not perfect, but working and food grade), good size, good location, backing from Mycorena gives it a good boost, could leave some equipment, keep network, quicker start-off, input from other people, easier possibility of collaborating, more reach, looks better for both sides if the CTO starts something up like that?
-   Cons: Trusting Ram, possibly not being completely independent (needs a strong contract!), more expensive than I would like in the beginning, too big, many problems with the place, not really mine,
-   Find out and brain-storm: What are the regulations regarding food-grade, is it only for Mycorena or for another company coming after? What is really bad with the place that would be a deal breaker? What other things would be deal breakers? What would have to be completely certain in the contract to avoid future problems (e.g. independent from Mycorena, not restriction on what we produce and who we collaborate with (no exclusivity), rental agreement with notice period).
-   Make: Short presentation about the idea and how it could run, for both Ram + the team, but also outside people. Make a more formal list of pros, cons, concerns and requirements for moving into the Mycorena Ringön space. Make a list of people to talk to for inital funding and help and contact them (Yesbox, Innovation office, GU Ventures, Göteborg Stad, etc.).

**Ram+Ebba, 11-09-2020**

-   They would like to do something with the place. Ram already thinks way ahead with having shares in my company, having people pay subscriptions etc. Ebba understands that I want to stay independent.
-   They are up for trying something, but emphasise that I would have to be the project leader and can in return e.g. get a really cheap rate (2000 SEK/month) for using the place.
-   Current rent: 17 000 SEK per month. So that's what they want to break even with (or let's say 20 000 SEK/month).
-   In a subscription model, I could be the first of the subscribers with quite a low rate, and then get comission for getting in new customers.
-   Restrictions: no direct competition to Mycorena, i.e. no liquid fermentation for fungi as an ingredient. Tempeh and such things are fine. `—> However, could direct competition not be good for Mycorena? Then you know first hand what is being done and you have the first chance to get in on it.`
-   Things to think about: What would have to be adapted and refurbished to make it attractive for people? What is the demand for people to rent such a space? What could we offer? How much work and money would it take to refurbish Ringön to a certain standard? Who are the customers? Who would pay a subscription for such a space? If you want to make a product, why not just rent a kitchen? Is there actually a market?
-   `We seem to have a shared vision, which is good, but we need to know more to make it work. Mostly about actual demand and how it could work. I am willing to put some work into it, but I don't want to build up and manage a fermentation hub for Mycorena, only so they don't have to pay the rent and have a good story for their CTO leaving.`
-   To make it a big thing, we would need to have someone like Göteborg Stad, VGR, Livsmedelsacceleratorn, etc. on board and for that we need to know the demand `—> ask Fredrik about that.`

**Matt, 13-09-2020**

-   VERY positive towards the idea, he thinks well-made craft tempeh would definitely sell to various high-end restaurants (and other places) in Gothenburg.
-   I should make a list of all possible restaurants (e.g. Familjen, Pigalle-Family, etc.) and he can put me in contact with some people he knows. There is someone called Björn that he mentions has a food truck and is often at Lindholmen streetfood market and is very nice.
-   To sell it: just call up or email a restaurant and ask for a short meeting with the head chef. Then bring some tasty samples, best is one fairly plain and one nicely prepared (e.g. in a Banh mi with some nice lemon mayonnaise and good bread, etc.) so they see what it can taste like.
-   Ringön seems too big for a start and distracting from the idea of making tempeh. I shouldn't run a fermentation hub for Mycorena when I actually want to start small. Don't let yourself get talked into something, and be careful about Ram.
-   The most important: **make fucking great tempeh**. Figure out some recipes.
-   Getting a small place is easy. All I need is a kitchen and a good storage room. For incubation, I can buy a holding closet for kitchens that can keep a certain temperature (and often also certain humidity). I could even have small courses already in a small space and store people's ferments in some shelves. Matt used to rent kitchen space at night in a restaurant to try out things, so chefs are often up for that as well (if I just need space to prepare food).
-   For selling to individuals, make it as easy as possible. People can't cook. Marinate it and sell them only marinated, flavoured stuff, so they can't do anything wrong.
-   `Start experimenting more with unusual tempeh recipes, esp. including Swedish grains and legumes. Get some miso going.`
-   In the summer, just rent a food truck and serve some things.
-   Recipe collaborations with restaurant, e.g. exclusive tempeh for a certain restaurants that I develop together with the chef. Can only be sold in this one restaurant then.
-   In a restaurant, ingredients shouldn't cost more than 25% of the dish. Of that 25%, 2/3 are for the protein, because carbs and veggies cost nothing. Serving sizes for meat are usually 150-200 g. Restaurants often buy from special shops if they actually have better quality. Small batches are fine if the quality is top notch (e.g. cheese from a very small supplier, special organic ingredients from Gröna Boden).
-   Have a plan for when a batch goes wrong!! You can't let a restaurant down with 20 portions for the weekend! `—> Always have some frozen options going.`
-   How long does it keep for? If for 1 week, make sure it keeps for 3 (because restaurants will use it for 3 weeks if you tell them it lasts for 1). So make sure you know what happens with the product during storage. `—> Figure out shelf life!`
-   Map the flavours of the different tempehs to have something to present to chefs, they love these kinds of things. Pairings, suggestions of applications, etc.

**Bo Norrman, 17-09-2020**

**Fredrik Schubert (RISE), 21-09-2020**

Q: Test-kitchen at RISE, what's the demand? What do people need? Do you think there is a demand for a fermentation space? How did it go with your kombucha production, did you have a possibility of making it somewhere? Are there places out there? If yes, what do they offer and how much do they cost? Is there a demand at RISE? Did you talk to anyone at RISE that thought it was a good idea? Who to talk to next? Someone at Livsmedelsacceleratorn maybe?

-   He is quite pessimistic about the "fermentation hub" idea working well. It's just too much investment into equipment and doing up a place to make it attractive for customers. And then you have he problem of _finding_ customers and keeping it running. It's very hard to find customers! Especially hard if you don't have a good network yet. If someone like RISE made offered a fermentation facility instead, it would be much more of a clear way for customers, i.e. companies, to come to such a place and ask for test runs, use it as a test-bed, etc.
-   RISE Forum is a test bed that has various specialisations, e.g. a charcuterie with 10 smokers, a bakery, etc. but currently it's not used very much and only from internal users. 10-15 years ago it was always completely booked, but the researchers left for industry and it was never really taken up again after that. There are plans for reviving it, however, and even of including a fermentation facility. With or without me they will be going to do something there `—> Fredrik will put me in contact with Klara Bååth (his boss) who is very nice and is the best person to talk about my ideas of the fermentation hub. Maybe there are some involvement possibilities in the future?`
-   He currently has a customer who are struggling with making a consistent batch of organic apple cider vinegar. They can't figure out what's wrong, but they also don't really have the knowledge or the equipment. For someone like that such a facility would be great. But they don't have any money to do anything.
-   Intel: the government is giving RISE 350 Mio SEK in the next years to build up a sustainable biogas production in Uppsala. Maybe something for me in the future?
-   Regarding Fredrik's kombucha business: it was super hard to find customers, they struggled a lot. Despite getting good feedback that their kombucha tasted really good. They also had a much too expensive place (miljöförvaltningen checked and everything). They produced up to 200 L a week in mostly 25 L barrels and everything really low-tech and manual. They also did bottling themselves.
-   He can connect me with a RISE tempeh specialist in Uppsala. Maybe she has some ideas for something?
-   Conclusion: Negative about fermentation hub idea, but positive about that fermentation facilities are needed in the future and that there is growing demand for it. In his opinion, it would be best to have it integrated in RISE and I could possibly be involved in that in some way.
