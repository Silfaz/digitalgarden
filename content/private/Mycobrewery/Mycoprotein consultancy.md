## Notes for consultancy call

### 1. Consumer pain points
= unmet needs, wanting to be satisfied. Persistent problems with a product or service that 
Consumer (i.e. person buying mycoprotein products)
- Unfamiliarity, unusual product
- Yuck-factor (mould) --> less in people who already consume fermented and mouldy products. Helps to compare yourself to brewing processes, cheese, etc. 
- (Perception of) highly processed food
- Most important: sensory attributes, i.e. taste and texture
- Clean label (not too many additives). 
- Nutritional benefits, (perceived) health --> there were some studies on how mycoprotein helps in muscle building and is equal to beef, etc.
- Safe to eat? Quorn had some problems in the US about gastrointestinal problems. 
- Expect mycoprotein to behave in same way as meat. --> This is more of an issue for people that really look for meat-like behaviour. Too realistic might put another group of customers off.
- Affordability. Cheap or at least not that much expensive than meat. Affordability, together with tastiness, were the two categories were mycoprotein was ranked lowest in a recent study (2023, Dean) https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14163292. Biggest drivers to try mycoprotein were nutrition, safe to eat, sustainability.
- In recent paper (Chezan et al., 2022) the overall acceptance was found to be quite low. Likely due to a perceived low appeal and tastiness of fungal protein products. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.106043

Customer (i.e. company buying mycoprotein as B2B product)
- Except mycoprotein to behave like meat: taste, texture, processibility.
- Safe to eat
- Nutrition
- Price
- State that the product comes in: wet (frozen), dried as flour, in chunks, in blocks, etc. Pumpable paste. 
- Purity (how much protein, how much fibre, colour, odour)



### 2. Biggest challenges/hurdles
For mycoprotein producers
- **Expertise** --> not that many people out there that have experience with cultivating fungi in large scale, especially not for food production.
- **High investment costs**
- Small number of **"allowed" fungal strains**. Otherwise difficult process to get safety status by FDA or EFSA. 
- Some **pricey substrates** needed, e.g. nitrogen compounds, minerals and vitamins, carbon source --> some could be taken from side streams, but that opens a whole other chapter of challenges (purity and consistency of side stream, composition, appearance in the final product, safe transfer of side stream, dependence on specific supplier, insufficient consumption by fungi, suboptimal consumption by fungi (--> does the cheaper price make up for that?)).
- **Contamination**: sterile process with high sugar content, nice temperature and neutral pH. This is where a lot of contaminants love to grow. 
- **Consistent production**. Tricky if not all parameters are monitored and balanced in the right way. Depending on cultivation conditions, fungus grows more or less fibrous, produces off-flavours, can produce toxins, etc.
- Customer and consumer **acceptance**. B2B customers usually want high volumes at a very consistent quality --> can you deliver that? They are used to getting protein concentrate powders with a defined protein content; mycoprotein's strength is not being a powdered ingredient (but maybe they want that?). Consumers (see question 1) might have reservations towards mycoprotein, the health and safety aspects, perceived taste, etc. 
- **Texture** of final product (if fresh): fibres are nice, but can be too much. How to modulate that you get the benefit of fibres, without it tasting like cardboard?
- Ensuring safety: mycotoxin monitoring.
- **Downstream processing**: Harvesting (dewatering), heat treatment, post-processing (RNA removal/inactivation), food safety aspects, energy demand of drying. All processing steps influence the texture massively, because the texture is so dependent on the structure of the fungal mycelium, how much water it holds, if the protein is denatured or not, if certain ions are present in the cultivation liquid, etc.
- Storage: Freeze or dry --> both energy intense and result in very different products. What is more appealing to customers (B2C or B2B)?
- Labelling: just mycoprotein, brand name, or species name?


### 3. Innovation potential for mycoprotein
- **Cheaper, healthier and tastier than meat.** Easy ;) 
- Focusing on fibre aspect of mycoprotein --> something that is completely lacking in meat and that could give an edge. 
- Finding a diversity of fungi species that can be included in the portfolio that serve different aspects: e.g. different tastes and textures, suitable for different applications, bioactive compounds, different amino acid profiles, etc. Though finding unique fungi with different tastes and textures is VERY tricky. A lot can be done with varying culture conditions and substrates. 
- Creating a trustable brand that people associate with a tasty product. 
- Finding consumer paint points in current plant-based meat options and improving them: 
- To make the production process cheaper and more robust, use learnings from other fermentation processes: provide conditions that only favour your organism of interest: high temperature, low or high pH, certain substrates, producing inhibiting substances, co-cultivation with a selective organism. 
- Improvements on bioreactor design --> useful to be in collaboration with a university. Air intake is very important, how can that be improved in a clever way?


### 4. Possible applications and future applications
- Fresh products are the obvious strength of mycoprotein, but I think there's a huge possibility for a protein concentrate that is functional (foamable, stable in emulsion, can be fermented), has a neutral colour and no off-taste. Currently, every plant protein has some big disadvantages, and it's mostly that there is an unpleasant plant/grassy/beany note that is hard to cover up. 
- Incorporating fat into the mix



### 5. CAPEX (rough/ballpark)
_Prices are 2021 levels, so probably increased._
Prices depend very much on grade of equipment (lab, food-grade, pharmaceutical, brewery) and even grade of steel. There can be huge differences. 

Cheapest: Buy and adapt a brewery fermentor from abroad (Czechia, China), get it delivered. Or get old pharma equipment and adapt. 

If custom-made (in Switzerland): 
- 500 L bioreactor with all additions: 4 mio SEK

If custom-made (in Sweden):
- 100 L bioreactor: 500 000 SEK
- 1000 L bioreactor: 750 000 SEK
- 10 000 L bioreactor: 1.8 mio SEK
- Stirrers, filter system, thermo system, pH system, oxygen system, foam control: about 100 000 SEK each
So for a whole line from seed reactor to 10 m3 with installation and all controls: 5-7 mio SEK.

## Unique selling points of mycoprotein

- **Muscle building**
	- Mycoprotein can be as effective in muscle building as a high-protein omnivorous diet
	- Study published in Journal of Nutrition: Quorn https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/vegan-protein-supports-muscle-building-as-effectively-as-animal-protein-according-to-study/
	- Comparable to animal protein in terms of its ability to facilitate increases in muscle mass and strength
	- Mycoprotein (Quorn) stimulated post-exercise muscle buidling to a greater extent than milk protein.
	- https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190703121431.htm
- **Dietary fiber**
	- Prebiotic
	- Mycoprotein contains two thirds beta-glucans and one third chitin
	- Around 25% fiber per dry weight or 6% per 100 g wet weight.
	- Possibly cholesterol-lowering effects due to fiber, as well as lowering of glycemic index (blood glucose). 
	- Possible positive effect on gut microbiota. 
- **Protein**
	- Up to 45% protein per dry weight, or around 11% per 100 g wet weight.
	- Rich in essential amino acids, good amino acid profile (better than most plants)

- **Relatively low environmental impact**
	- 10 times less carbon, water or land use compared to beef. 
	- Depends very much on production process, feedstock, what it's compared to, etc. 
	- Study in Nature 2022: replacing 20% of per-capita beef consumption with mycoprotein could cut global deforestation and CO2 emissions by 50% in addition to lowering methane emissions.
- **Fibrous structure**
	- More pleasant texture than a lot of other meat analogues
- Fungal strains can be adapted, engineered and improved (more easily than plants or animals)
	- **Genetic engineering, directed evolution, screening, selection**
- Potential to use much cheaper feedstock (e.g. agricultural waste streams) compared to other meat analogue production. 
## Challenges in production process
- Sterility/contamination
- Yield
- Expensive nutrients need to be added (vitamins, nitrogen/protein)
- Waste products
- Removal or inactivation of RNA
- Separation of substrate from fungal mycelium
- Energy consumption or optimisation of production parameters
- Use of waste streams vs. high yield and uniform production process
- Depending on how it's calculated and where the energy comes from, mycoprotein is not necessarily the best in terms of environmental impact. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-015-0931-6
- 

### Other challenges
- Many different fungal species and strains that can behave in different ways
- Mycotoxins, allergic reactions, sensitivity
- Fiber could also be a challenge in protein extraction, functionality
- Novel food/FDA approval
- Environmental figures always look best in comparison to beef. Whole production process needs to be considered.

## Cultivation in general
- Yield depends on type of organism,  substrate and production process. 
- Some GRAS species: Fusarium venenatum (Quorn), Rhizopus oryzae (tempeh), Aspergillus oryzae (koji), Monascus purpureus, Paradendryphiella salina.
- 

## Submerged cultivation grown on starch
- Quick, controlled
- Very pure and controlled feedstock. Usually cheap and available.
- Promotes monocultures for feedstock cultivation. 
- Not the most environmentally sustainable. 
- Easy to post-process (RNA inactivation, pumping, filtering, freezing, packaging)


## Submerged cultivation grown on edible fibrous material (e.g. brewer's spent grain)
- Growth, yield and type of product depends very much on feedstock.
- Feedstock likely not completely degraded/metabolised by fungus, so will remain to some degree part of the final product. 
- Effects taste and nutritional composition.
- Might have to be supplemented with sugar, nitrogen or vitamins. 
- Perhaps enzyme treatment might increase nutrient availability. 
- High potential of finding a unique fungus that is very well suited for cultivation on a specific substrate.
- Allergen potential and variability of substrate if sourced from different sources.
- Microbial contamination depending on how it's handled at the primary production site.


## Solid state cultivation
- Less prone to contamination
- Usually slower than submerged (several days to weeks). 
- Harder to have uniform nutrient composition, mixing, heat transfer, dispersion of mycelium. 
- Some fungi only grow as solid state
- Usually used for growing basidiomycetes, fungi that develop fruiting bodies (mushroooms). 
- Tricky to separate (fibrous) substrate material from mycelium. 
- Surface cultivation could be done (like Atlast/Mybacon/Ecovative that grow sheets of mycelium on top of the substrate).  
- Some companies (e.g. Israeli Kinoko or US Mycotechnology) call their process solid state fermentation, though it's more like a tempeh process - growing fungi on beans and grains to create a food product.
- Possibility of actual protein extraction from fibre-mycelium mix via drying, air fractionation, pH precipitation, etc.
