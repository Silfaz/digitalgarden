Information from [](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises)[https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises)

Before starting, you need to **register your business** with the local authorities, mostly Miljö- och hälsoskyddsnämnden in your kommun (most cafés, restaurants, shops, etc., some exceptions, e.g. if you only occasionally sell at local markets). Usually Livsmedelsverket controls food productions, e.g. meat, fish. Food businesses that primärproduktion (vegetables, bees) need approval from the länsstyrelse. You have to pay the fees for registrations and inspections. You have to tell the responsible authorities if you change or stop your operations.

The company needs to have **suitable equipment, facilities and a system for own checks**. Everyone handling food along the whole production chain needs to be aware of hygiene risks and own control systems need to be in place.

The production facility needs to be approved by Livsmedelsverket if it delivers to other food producers. What is needed to register for approval? Name and address, org number or personnummer, location of production, description of production. The responsible authorities have forms for registration. A registration is not an approval yet! A decision about the registration will be reached in 2 weeks. Production can be started 2 weeks after a complete registration has been sent in to Livsmedelsverket. After that, an appointment for surveying will be made (which costs), and after that a yearly fee is required.

Other requirements have to be fulfilled as well, e.g. regarding Skatteverket, Bolagsverket, sophämtning, källsortering, farligt avfall, etc.

Food production in your own kitchen is allowed if it fulfills the requirements for hygienic food production. You have to contact miljökontoret in your kommun and they will say if you can register your food production. The main requirements are that the food is produced in a safe way and that the person producing the food has the right knowledge, routines in place that prevent risks and does regular self controls.

## Food Safety regarding tempeh

[](http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206)[http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206](http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206): Basically, keep the beans below pH 4.3 and oxygen at all times, make sure the Rhizopus outcompetes quickly. Freezing the final product is best for storage, because in the fridge it overripens in 2-3 days and produces unpleasant ammonia byproducts.
