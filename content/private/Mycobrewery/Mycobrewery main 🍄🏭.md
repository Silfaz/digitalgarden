# What is The Mycobrewery?

The Mycobrewery starts as an (urban) mushroom farm and fermentation place (tempeh, kimchi) and develops over time into a hub for all fungi- and fermentation-related things. The main focus will be food and beverage production, courses, education and knowledge creation, as well as in the further future a test-bed for the development of home fermentation kits.

By building up The Mycobrewery, we will gain knowledge about growing and propagating mushrooms and fungi, get a network of customers, be involved in different projects, develop the business further and spread out into other areas.

The Mushroom Brewery should have a focus on sustainable growth, sustainable production, community, quality and scientific expertise. It should not be run as a "DIY farm", but rather as a more sophisticated, cool and futuristic, but still approachable and friendly, knowledge and production centre. Research can and should be a part of the concept, where new applications of fungi are tested and further developed, ideally in collaboration with a university or company.


# Concept 1: Mushroom farm, expanding into other businesses, focused on selling products

## What are the products and the necessary steps?

### Step 1

Small-scale mushroom farming for local restaurants and private customers. Small-scale tempeh production (different grains, different pulses, marinated) for local restaurants and customers.

Investigate interest (mostly from restaurants around), scout for places (how big, how central, minimum requirements), talk to city people, look for funding opportunities, talk to people who do similar things (aquaculture guy, city farming people, microbrewery people, mushroom farms, tempeh producers)

### Step 2

Larger-scale mushroom farming (more volume, more variety) for local restaurants, private customers and selected supermarkets. Courses and education for people interested in mushroom growing.

### Step 3

Addition of more fungi- and fermentation-related activities, e.g. kombucha, "Quorn", beer, miso. Expansion of courses and education. Development of mushroom growing and different fermentation kits and equipment for online and at-site sales.

### Step 4

Addition of sales of developed and custom-made home bioreactors and other specialised fermentation equipment.

### Additional possibilities

Art projects, exhibitions, university collaborations, consultancy for companies, online courses, Youtube videos, recipes, product development, city development collaborations, resource use, newsletter, book, talks, podcast, open lab, etc.


## Who are customers and who can be involved?

-   Local restaurants (mainly New Nordic cuisine, vegetarian/vegan places, independent café and caterers)
-   Individual customers that buy the products
-   Individuals interested in growing mushrooms, brewing beer, fermentation, mycology, scientific background of fungi and fermentation, that attend the courses
-   "Event"-searching people and companies that attend the courses
-   (Food producing) companies that need some ideas, innovation or testing for either making new products, get inspiration, get knowledge or get someone try out something with their products. Also possible with their side streams, to make it into a new product.



# Concept 2: Fermentation hub with innovation, education and production

In contrast to concept 1, this concept is from the start a bit more focused on the "innovation hub" aspect. This means acting primarily as a space for people who are interested in trying out and making products with fermentation. Offering a food-grade production place for making food, experimenting and testing.

## What are the products and the necessary steps?

### Step 1

Setting up a small-scale tempeh production that sells to local cafés and restaurants. Trying out different other fermentation options (kimchi, kombucha) and getting the minimum machinery for small-scale production.

### Step 2

Setting up courses and workshops for people interested in trying out fermentation. Coming up with innovative concepts that people can taste and try.

Little shop with all necessary equipment to start your own fermentations at home. Own-branded items (see "Branding" section below), books, etc.

### Step 3

Offering a subscription-based production or lab space where people interested in developing their own idea can come, verify it and even produce it. This would go hand-in-hand with running the workshops on the side and own production of products.

Possibility of hosting events for groups and companies, inviting a chef for catering, a test bed for new products for other food-producing companies (e.g. Mycorena), verifying small batches of products, local production.

Applying for funding for developing the concept further, collaborating with other food producers, "waste" producers, etc.

# Branding

Should be between organic and scientific. Not too sterile and corporate, but also not full on instagram vegan. Something like [Basic Theory Ferments](https://www.basictheoryferments.nl/) strikes a nice balance.

Simple colour schemes, nice simple logo(s).

Nice branding concept, example from Food & Beyond: [](https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699)[https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699](https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699)

Offer kits and custom equipment with the branding on it, e.g. the right size boxes for incubation chambers with the right number of holes in it, little packages of tempeh starter with the logo on it, marinade mixes, delux kits including an immersion cooker, nice jars with a discreet logo, little mushroom merch, etc.

Nice little sales area with books, products and equipment.

Nicely designed course material with logo and good instructions + photos.

Good high quality photos of everything.

# What's missing? Ideas

Organically produced starter cultures for Rhizopus (—> e.g. Bärta write on their website that they can't get hold of them and that they buy it from Belgium right now).

No one is making natto —> tasting sessions? Fermentations levels - beginners, intermedia, expert

Tempeh tasting map to show what the different flavours and characteristics are

Fermentation subscription: get a new fermented product every month

Tempeh snacks, tempeh chips, tempeh ölkorv, miso sweets, sweet tempeh, tempeh (fish) fingers, miso marinades (for tempeh)

Offer tempeh and miso kits and starter cultures in own branded packages (with own label etc.) —> check what's important to be able to re-sell other people's stuff (e.g. tempeh starter culture from Indonesia)

Recipe package + right ingredients for small cafés (eg marinated tempeh and lemon mayonnaise for banh mi)

Collaborations and trials with waste from local industries: spent grains, coffee grounds, etc for mushroom cultivation and/or tempeh

Collaborations with Värt: making fermented products out of their saved foods?

Making different starter cultures (scoby, sourdough, Rhizopus, vattenkefir).

Try sweet things (for something like Café Alkemisten)

Ask Vega Bryggeri for help with smoking. They say on their website that they smoke everything, so I could probably go in on that.

Gothenburg is the beer capital of Sweden, so it should also become in general the fermentation capital of Sweden.

Brand tempeh variants according to Swedish cities? (E.g. the Göteborg, the Malmö) Or according to other Swedish things. How Swedish should the whole concept be?

Cold-attenuate tempeh starter/strain, so I can grow tempeh at room temperature (and sell the proprietary strain).
