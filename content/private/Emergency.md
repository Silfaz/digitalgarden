Breathe.

Breathe.

  

Do you want to make this work?

Yes?

Is what you're thinking damaging to making it work?

Stop it.

There's no point in feeling worse.

There's no point in imagining things.

  

Open Pocket and read something.

Watch a YouTube video.

Scroll Reddit for a while. 

Read Duncan's letter.

  

Breathe.

Imagine the singularity.

Breathe.
