**Overview** — _How is everything going? What’s the story arc of your life right now? What would you tell your past selves about how their efforts are paying off?_

Things are going quite well, even though 2020 has been crazy so far (and it might get even crazier with the US presidential elections happening tomorrow). There's a pandemic going on, which is strange and changed the lives of most people on earth. I haven't been anywhere really in the last 9 months, not further than walking distance from home basically. Most of the time it's ok, but there are times when I feel quite trapped and want to visit my parents and sister, etc. 
So aside from that, I also quit my promising start-up CTO job, because my boss was a dick, tried to come to terms with some private stuff, and I'm now trying to figure out what my next "career steps" are going to be. What do I want to do for the next years? Should I start my own business? Should I move to another country? I'm super indecisive and I'm not sure there's a right answer to any of these questions. 
I was worried when I quit at Mycorena that I might soon regret it and feel like I threw away an opportunity. But, after a few weeks of feeling a bit stressed because of it, I feel much better now. Life's too short to be mistreated. It was a good decision to move on. I learned a LOT during my Mycorena times and I feel now much more prepared for the "real" job market than after my Chalmers time. 

**For each current quest** — _How is it going? Are there habits or attitudes you can put in place to make it go better? Should it continue being an active quest, or should you mark it paused, completed, or abandoned?_

_- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person._
I just recently started doing a bit more exercise (HIIT), and I want to continue doing that. I also want to make more time for meditation and yoga.
_- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear._
Sewing has less priority for me now, because I started doing much more coding, generative art, plotting, fungi newsletter, fermentation, etc. I think for now it could be **paused** until I find the time again to take something on like this. It's also easier to make summer clothes, so for at least half a year I won't make sewing a priority.
_- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. _
Not sure if I am doing well there or not. Kind of a squishy quest. I recently tried to be a good friend to Pawel and Ausra, who are both going through a rough time. But to be honest, it's hard to do that well during pandemic times. But I made an effort to write messages. Talking "feelings" is still hard for me and I rather switch to "distraction mode". 
_- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology)._
Still a quest, but also quite undefined so far. Either the Mycobrewery idea will become something, or I work on some research questions in a company or research institute. 
_- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. _
Don't want to pause it, but same as with the other things, it's harder during pandemic times. We try to take long walks through nice forests, which is very good and I take nice photos. But it's hard to be adventerous when everything's so limited. I don't want to pause this quest, but I need to find more ways of making this happen during Covid times.  
_- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places._
This should probably be paused, I haven't really thought about this quest for months. Although now actually would be a great time to be able to drive. We don't really want to take public transport, but also long for a weekend away and a change of scene. To make this quest a higher priority I would have to take some actual steps towards driving more, like renting a car for a day and drive around, practice "difficult situations" in my head, etc. Actually, the more I think about being able to drive now, the more I would like to be able to do it. But I also hate cars and traffic, how is that compatibel?


**New quests** - _Are there any new quests you should instate, based on your current story arc and where you want the story to go next? Have you read anything or had any conversations lately that contained especially meaningful topics that you want to do something about? What habits or attitudes could support it? What is the purpose of the quest; how does it get you closer to your cadence?_

- Become a comfortable coder, i.e. get to a point in a language where it doesn't feel like such a big thing to start tinkering around and code something. On one hand I enjoy it and want to learn more, on the other hand I want to keep this road open to future job opportunities that are easier to do remotely. To get further in this quest, I should make coding a more regular task and put time aside to do projects, play around, etc. The purpose of this quest, regarding my cadence, is that I don't necessarily want to be bound to one location because of my job.
- I want to become more of a fungi and fermentation technology expert. I really enjoy the topics around fungi, alternative proteins, food fermentation, etc. and I think that changing our diets to be more vegan/vegetarian/sustainable is one of the most important things, so I want to be able to put my efforts into this area. Fermentation technology, especially fungi, also have the immense potential to produce things and convert things in a very sustainable way, so that's another topic where I want to be involved in and use my time and knowledge. To be more involved in that, I should become a more active member of something like The Good Food Institute, do a good job writing my fungi newsletter, stay up to date with fungi and alternative protein research topics and find a job that allows me to dig deeper into these things. The purpose of this quest, regarding my cadence, is that I want to contribute something meaningful to the world and use my energy for something that is good and useful. 
- Related to above, but more concrete (because of a newly added cadence): Build my profile as a "fungi and fermentation expert" more publicly, try new things and write about it, take initiatives, connect with like-minded people. I should make a list of people who do cool stuff and see how I can connect with them, do something similar or be involved with them.

**Ideal self** —_ Have you learned anything durable enough that it should be recorded in your Rules or Personal Canon?_

I add "food fermentation", because I am very inspired by the people that do it and I want to be one of them. It's a nice combination of using ingredients, trying out things, see microbes at work, make something delicious, reduce food waste, preserve something, be healthy, etc. 

I also add "Breath of the wild", because it is SUCH a good game and every once in a while I come back to it and it just feels so nice. It's so well made. 

I also add "Craig Mod walking and photography adventures". I just got really inspired by the way he walks and takes photos of seemingly mundane things, but they are still nice to look at and to share. It's a good way of exploring your surrounding, connecting with the environment and keeping a curious and appreciative eye on everything. 

**Cadence** — _Does your cadence still reflect where you want your life to go? Can you make it more specific? Do you need to make it a bit more vague? Most importantly, are your quests actually bringing you closer to it?_

In general the cadence is still true, but it's also quite vague. Therefore, I included a more concrete part about what I (currently) want my future job situtation to be like. I will definitely want to do something with science, and currently fungi and fermentation are my biggest interest. I want to have a research and discovery element to my job, but also an "outreach" element which could be courses, books, newsletters, exhibitions, etc. I want to be  a scientist foremost, but have elements of an artist and teacher in it. At the moment, descriptions of people that make me excited are people who do something unusual and combine different things in an exciting way, e.g. a fermentation expert consulting chefs, a curator of a microbe museum, leading a community science center, product development and consultancy for different companies, travelling the world and exploring microbes in different contexts. How do I reach a level of "expertise" to do any of these things? Build my profile more publicly, try new things and write about it, take initiatives, connect with like-minded people. That should probably be in my quests then as well, so I'll add it.  


**Message from the past** — _Say hello to your future selves. What would they appreciate knowing is important to you now?_


Currently I'm very undecided about which job direction I should take in the future. I've put a lot of work into making a business plan for the Mycobrewery, but I am unsure if it's really something I actually want to do. The research jobs, like Oatly or VTT, seem "safer", but I also want to dare something. However, in any of these jobs I can continue to develop and go towards my greater goals outline in my cadence. Neither choice is permanent or cuts me off from any other future things. So try to be brave and be confident in yourself. 
Otherwise, look back at 100 days ago and see how much better you're exercising now and how much better your coding skills are than last time! It pays off to do something, right? ;)
