#cadence #personaldevelopment 
## List of default activities:

## My cadence:
- I sit in the porch of our house in a cosy jumper and drink a morning tea. I look out over the frozen landscape. I'm calm and happy and look forward to a day of exciting and rewarding work.
- I'm part of a strong community. We help each other, share thoughts, make projects, create. The others regard me as an integral part and come to me for advice. The trust is mutual.
- I swim through clear water with strong strokes. Duncan swims beside me. From the shore we hear laughter and splashes. We smile at each other. 
- I have an exciting job that I enjoy working on also outside of "office hours". Something involving microbes and fermentation, research and outreach. Maybe I lead a fermentation hub, maybe I curate a microbe museum, maybe I'm a fermentation consultant who teaches people how to produce their own fermented food on the side. My job allows me to talk excitedly about scientific topics and increases the knowledge we have about fungi, fermentation, etc. 

## My quests:
- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person.
- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear.
- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. 
- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology).
- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. 
- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places.
