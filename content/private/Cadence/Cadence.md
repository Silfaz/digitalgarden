# Cadence

>"Every person you think is cool got that way by regularly doing things that made them a better person."

Take the pieces you like, discard the rest, make it your own. 


Habits = things you DO automatically
Attitudes = things you THINK automatically

Strata: defaults -> actions -> projects -> new habits -> quests -> cadence

Default: Activity you fall back on in moments (minutes). Default activities can change and also fit into a theme or current quest.
Action: Concrete thing you get done to work toward an outcome (minutes-hours). 
Project: Concrete outcome comprised of actions (days-weeks).
New habit: Establish as regular part of your life (weeks-months).
Quest: Bigger theme, more permanently changes who you are (months-years).
Cadence: Vision of the perfect moment (decades).

Regular reviews = conference with your ideal self
Periodic revies: Cadence & quests
Daily reviews: Projects & habits
Momentary reviews: Actions
Instant reviews: Defaults

**Ideal self**
- Lists of works to revisit often to take guidance & inspiration from.
- Books, films, articles, places, music.
- Things that bring you closer to the kind of person you want to be.

**False idols:**
>"Most likely the people out there who are most like you want to be are not known to you."

>"Don't wait until the achievement to be happy."

>"Be more sceptical of a thing the bigger the audience is."
