**Overview** — _How is everything going? What’s the story arc of your life right now? What would you tell your past selves about how their efforts are paying off?_

Things are good! My last cadence review was almost exactly a year ago, since then a lot of things have changed. I started a new job in February (Oatly) and we moved to Helsingborg. I'm very happy with both of these decisions, although I am still a bit sad about leaving Gothenburg. 
Oatly job: 
Pros: Great company (good product, good missions, respect and care about their employees, etc.), great colleagues and really interesting tasks. So much freedom in doing almost "blue sky" research into enzymes or proteins or carbohydrates, etc. Very self-directed. Good pay (though maybe I could have gambled a bit higher? I get 47 000 SEK per month before tax now). 
Cons: Things are quite messy, undefined and unstructured. Oatly went from few people to suddenly a lot of new hires, the lab space is not enough, a pandemic is going on, etc. On top of that, the Technology Development team that I am part of is newly established, we're missing routines, instructions, aims, prioritization, etc. But this is just something to get comfortable with and work on. Colleague-wise, basically everyone has a family with kids, and the ones that don't live in Malmö or Lund and are pregnant or will get kids soon. Not very international (yet) and therefore a bit awkard with Swedish/English, etc. 

Helsingborg: 
Pros: Something different! After more than a year of pandemic life, it was really nice to have a bit of a change. Location is very nice (right at the seaside, view of Denmark, close to some interesting cities), pretty medieval buildings, found some really nice restaurants already. Apartment is bigger and airier. Big windows to south and north, big studio room with space for sewing, plotting, soldering, working, reading, etc. 
Cons: It's not Gothenburg. Smaller and less choice of things. No East African restaurant, no nearby Ramberget and Hisingsparken, no Bohus klippor. Milder climate (and therefore even less chance of snow than in GBG) and not as much nature (Delsjön, skärgården, etc.). And of course no friends. We had reached such a nice level in GBG that we knew enough great people to hang out with, that it was no problem to just message somone on the weekend to arrange a walk or lunch or whatever. In HBG we know no one. 

In general though I am very happy. I regard this Oatly-Skåne experiment very much as a test to see how we like it here, how things are going, what comes up next, etc. I really like it at Oatly and can imagine working there for quite a while, but we'll see what happens. Maybe I can join the Singapore research team that is supposed to be built up soon? Maybe we'll move to Malmö? Maybe something else comes up? Right now, Helsingborg is interesting enough, we found nice nature, we are eager to explore Skåne and Denmark a bit more, want to join some organisations (orienteering? miljöpartiet?) to get some connections, want to improve our Swedish, etc. 

**For each current quest** — _How is it going? Are there habits or attitudes you can put in place to make it go better? Should it continue being an active quest, or should you mark it paused, completed, or abandoned?_

_- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person._
I still struggle with finding a good, consistent schedule to incorporate both yoga and mediation, but also something like HIIT into my life. Of course I'm walking a lot with Laika, but I would like to have more targeted exercise. Though both my physical and mental health have been really good over the last year.
I will work on dedicating 2 mornings a week to either HIIT or yoga.
---> ***Pick times for exercise and put it in the calendar. Start a 100 days of x calendar to feel a sense of achievement***

_- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear._
Sewing as a quest was paused during the last year, but I actually made a few things that I am really happy with. I made a pair of comfy linen trousers that I wore almost non-stop in summer. And I made my most advanced project yet: a light-blue corduroy jacket that I also have worn a lot since I've finished it. I am getting to a stage in my sewing where I select my projects a bit more targeted and build up a wardrobe of things that go together well. I also made a few things for Duncan. So I think in general, I am on a good track with this quest. What I still want to improve is to know what to do when e.g. the sleeves are not ideal or when I want to make a more exciting collar. Maybe a Domestika course about drafting your own patterns could be something?
--> ***Completed***

_- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. _
I think at work I have made myself already known as a very helpful and reliable person to my colleagues. I make an effort in offering help when they can't come to the lab for example and need something. I like to think that they think of me as someone helpful (without feeling exploited). 
I want to make more effort in keeping in touch with friends in GBG, by either writing to them semi-regularly or visiting occasionally. I want to keep track of their life as well and for example ask about their child or how their job search is going, etc. 
--> ***Make it a recurring task in my to-do list app to check up on friends. Make sure all their birthdays (and their kids?) are in my Google Calendar instead of just on Facebook***

_- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology)._
This was very much paused since I started at Oatly. I kept up my fungi newsletter a bit, but it became SO much less of a priority. I also took up a consultancy job for a start-up (Libre Foods) that wants to make mycelium bacon. Bit frustrating, because they don't actually have any technology yet but completely overblown plans. 
Now after 3 months of settling into the new apartment I feel ready to restart fermentation experiments, and also dig a bit deeper into fungi in general (mushrooms, etc.). I do want to keep the link to it, I am interested in it, etc. But I think I will (for now) do it less as a future job opportunity and more like just a hobby. 
--> ***Paused***

_- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. _
Not so much emphasis on that in the past year, but there were a few things that we did to keep a bit of adventure going, despite the pandemic. We took the train to Borås, we took the boat to Ven, we had a little road trip around Skåne with Chris, I took the train to Austria, we went to Helsingör for a morning. Getting out of the house is good for new ideas and thoughts. It would be nice to have a bit more structure in how to collect and cultivate taste and inspiration. 
--> ***Start using pinterest more to just collect things on the internet that I like***

_- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places._
Still not progressed. I go back and forth between longing for the ability to just rent a camper van and drive across Europe with Duncan and Laika, and not wanting to drive at all because of traffic, pollution, accidents, etc. Paused for now, I won't take driving lessons in winter. But maybe revamp for next summer? It would open up so many possiblities, but how will I get the confidence to drive for long distances during a holiday, if I don't put in the time to practice for a while?
--> ***Investigate driving schools in HBG***

_- Become a comfortable coder_
Not so much progressed, because of lack of time and inspiration about what to do. I'll keep it paused for now, but maybe still work on it a little bit.
Change in Nov: signed up for a Python course and have actually been working on it every day for the last 2 weeks. It's fun and still quite low level at the moment, but it will soon ramp up the difficulty. It's made for 100 days, but I'll stretch it out over longer. Aim is to do a little bit every day.
In addition, Duncan and I are doing Ben Collins' Google Sheets course, which comes in nice 15-30 min chunks, and it's a good evening activity together a few times a week.
--> ***Work on Python course and finish Google Sheets course***

_- Fungi fermentation technology expert_
I did work in that area as a freelance consultant during the past months, and did not feel 100% comfortable in that role. To really consider myself an expert, I would have to put in much more time to stay up to date with this very fast-expanding field, be in the start-up circles, Linkedin, etc. Not anything I really want to do right now, it makes me anxious and annoyed. I will continue to be interested in the area, but not in a professional way right now.
--> ***ended***




**New quests** - _Are there any new quests you should instate, based on your current story arc and where you want the story to go next? Have you read anything or had any conversations lately that contained especially meaningful topics that you want to do something about? What habits or attitudes could support it? What is the purpose of the quest; how does it get you closer to your cadence?_

_- Proficient in Swedish_
I'm surprised that is not on my list of active quests... Now with a job in an actual Swedish company, I feel the increased need to have at least good conversational Swedish. And getting to know people in Helsinborg will also be so much easier with Swedish. So I'll revamp the Swedish learning efforts and will prepare a structured learning schedule. 
--> ***Prepare Swedish learning schedule that focuses on talking and learning new words***

**Ideal self** —_ Have you learned anything durable enough that it should be recorded in your Rules or Personal Canon?_

I added a person on Instagram that I follow. She advocates slow fashion and seems to be in general a nice person. I just get a good vibe from it: calm, cosy, autumn colours, etc. 


**Cadence** — _Does your cadence still reflect where you want your life to go? Can you make it more specific? Do you need to make it a bit more vague? Most importantly, are your quests actually bringing you closer to it?_

In general the cadence is still true, but it's also quite vague. My last addition was a more concrete job idea that includes fermentation and microbes. Not so sure about that right now, because my current job takes me a bit away from that. But I am still interested in it and want to continue having that as part of my life, activities and identidy, but maybe not necessarily as my day job. We'll see. I'll leave it in for now. 
I got a bit away from being public about what I do. I put a lot of effort in building an fermentation Instram profile, writing the newsletter and posting on Linkedin for a good part of last year. And then (with the new job) I stopped that, and honestly, it feels really good. Just thinking about scrolling through Linkedin makes me anxious and seeing too much of exciting projects that people do feels somehow less inspiring and more stressful and like I don't have enough time and energy to do all that. So yeah, I'll take it a bit easier right now.


**Message from the past** — _Say hello to your future self. What would they appreciate knowing is important to you now?_


Oh dear, my last message was about greatly improved coding skills and exercise. That didn't really happen, did it? 
Anyway, hello future self! I hope you found a way to get to know some people in Helsingborg and feel more at home there. It will probably not be the place that you stay in forever (will there ever be one?) but I'm sure it will be a place that feels good for a part of your life. Don't feel stressed about things you haven't achieved yet. Try to see other people's work as inspiration, rather than as a reminder that you don't do enough. Take work seriously, but make sure that at the end of the day you still have energy to do things for yourself. And just start something. Right now, I feel like I want to work on some design skills, like learning pixel art or doing a pattern design course. Who knows where it leads, but I will keep some kind of progress log to be able to look back and be proud and excited of all the things that I tried this year. I think that's the most important thing: try new things, even if you then realise it wasn't for you. Document the outcome, file it away and try the next thing. If there is something that fits you, deepen the knowledge. Just read more about it. Go to the library to find some books about it. Collect pictures of nice patterns. Make a database about edible fungi. Make a garden of projects on your personal website.
