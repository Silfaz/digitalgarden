## 2013-09-30, Vienna
I woke up at half past 4 and I've been lying awake since then, thinking about a thousand things and also about you and what we can do together and now I'm so excited that I can't fall asleep any more. I want to do so many things with you! We'll go to Iceland and kiss on the plane and look at rocks and mountains and the sea and the waves. Then listen to bands and get drunk in bars and have sex a lot and cuddle a lot and kiss in the shower and in the streets of Reykjavik.

And in Gothenburg I want to go to the archipelago again and find weird shrubs under rocks and cook lots of pizza and maybe bake another cake, play games with you and watch films with you and watch the clouds and the stars with you, sit on the tram for ages and listen to music. I want to lie in the grass with you and in the snow and look into your eyes at the top of the hill when the sun is going down. And I'll show you how to dance waltz and how to ice skate and how to swear in German and how to make sweet tomato soup with cheese, that tastes much better than it sounds, and big fluffy dumplings with plum jam that look like boobs. I want to go on boat trips and train trips and maybe even road trips with you. And a million other things. Until we do all that I'll try to sleep some more and maybe dream about you
