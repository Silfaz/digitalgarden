2020 was a bit of a trainwreck of a year, but let's focus (mostly) on the positive things. 

### December 2019:
Just at the end of 2019, we did a little spa trip to the Asian spa in Varberg. Calm post-Christmas mood. A model train going around the Christmas tree in the hotel lobby. The onsen was amazing and the massage chairs ate our legs. Fell asleep in the chill-out hammocks. Bought fateful non-alcoholic berry wine in the local Systembolaget. Early on New Year's Eve Opa died.

### January 2020:
Duncan spent the early hours of 2020 on the toilet because of the Varberg berry wine. 
Some days I want to forget. Then short Austria trip for Opa's funeral (in hindsight the last flight for a long time).
Not too exciting Gothenburg Film Festival this year, we saw Inland (woman moving to the Swedish North), Little Joe (unemotional plant sci-fi), Meanwhile on Earth (Skånskt funeral industry), VHYes (fake 80ies tapes), When Tomatoes Met Wagner (farmers in Greece). 
Booked all the flights and exciting hotels for our Belize trip in June.
We also got our nice teal-coloured reading chair delivered, the most expensive piece of furniture I've ever owned. And one early, frosty morning we started walking Gotaleden, from Kungsportsplatsen all the way to Partille, with the intention to make this our year of walking "all of Gotaleden". Didn't exactly turn out this way.
First Swedish Corona case on the 31st.

### February 2020: 
Fabian visited and Duncan went to several museums with him. I sewed a thobe for Duncan and a loungewear set for myself. At Mycorena, we fixed up and started producing the first big batches with the 300L fermenter. So many problems with the steam generator. 
So many sleepless nights because of Shouty Man. He would often stand on the balcony and spit and shout and curse and throw things. 
Finally I decided to buy a year ticket for Västtrafik. That was a bad decision in hindsight, wasn't it.

### March 2020:
Corona still didn't seem to be such a problem, so we booked an introductory diving lesson in preparation for Belize. The pool was very deep and somewhere in Frölunda. I got extremely cold after a while and didn't enjoy the diving that much. Nice French man gave us a lift back to Kville. Then we walked all the way to Ringön to check on the fermentations, then had late night McDonalds.  
Shouty Man finally moved out. 
Had my last official day at Chalmers on the 23rd. 
Sewed myself a dress with lightning bolts on.
When I went to Stockholm to select lab equipment for Mycorena, the woman at SOBI  didn't want to shake hands. I remember finding it a bit exaggerated. 
At the end of the month, Duncan decided to get a Corona haircut and I shaved his hair. The shortest he'd had it since his birth.

### April 2020:
Beautiful weather for most of the time. We took a lot of walks to Svarta Mossen, Puffball Hill and Saltholmen. We bought an Axidraw pen plotter and started coding more generative art pieces to plot and put on Youtube and overlay with chillhop music. Plottervision, chillplot and plotspots were born. 
Had to cancel the skiing weekend with Chris & co to Kvitfjell, since everything started closing down.
Work at Mycorena got more and more to me. So many (too many) after-work-walks with Duncan were spent on that subject. 
One afternoon I came home earlier and we had picnic at Frihamnen.

### May 2020:
Eurovision was cancelled this year. The substitute was a sad show. But some of the entries were bangers. Remember "Cleopatrrrra"? 
Some days were already really warm. One day we went for a walk around Eriksberg with Eva and Kennet and Leonet&Björnen ice cream. Afterwards I felt guilty when Eva uploaded a tagged photo on Facebook, because the rest of Europe was in strict lockdown. 
At Mycorena we had a meatball launch in less than 60 days, a "Virtual Internship" and got 2.1 Mio EUR in investments. Still got shit from Ram. 
I made a skirt out of fabric that I got from Recreate Design's bankrupcy.

### June 2020:
On our walks we discovered Hökälla, a wetland nature reserve near Skogome, and Nuet, a neon-orange wooden tower with a nice view of Gothenburg in the distance. It was an art piece built for the 400 year anniversary of GBG, then almost taken down because of some district re-organisation dispute. 
I quit Mycorena and Ram took my resignation without any discussion. 
I sewed a kimono-style jacket for myself in a pineapple print fabric, and made a little dog pad for Laika. She also got a dog pool for her birthday, that she didn't like at all. Was just standing in the 10 cm high water not knowing what to do. We threw in treats to make her lie down, but that didn't really work and the treats dissolved after a while into a mushy mess. 
The days got longer and longer, until midsommar was here. We celebrated in a small round in Färjenäsparken. We started quite early, at around 11, and the weather was nice. I picked up some ice-cream from Leonet&Björnen at Eriksberg and then had to run all the way back to our picnic place before the ice-cream melted. Pawel brought Pavlova with raspberries. 
We decided that this year would be the year where we try camping, and we wanted to start somewhere on Hisingen. One morning we took the bikes to explore some good places. All went well until we reached Skändlaberg, Duncan missed the curbstone, I turned around and saw him fall off the bike and land with head and shoulder on the asphalt. Head was fine, but the shoulder was damaged and one half of his body was pretty scratched up. We took the bus home (the accident happened right at a countryside bus stop) and I went back there later that weekend with Pawel to pick up the bike.

### July 2020
For Duncan's birthday we met up with some friends up on Ramberget and sat on the rocks, drank non-alco beer and ate pink grapefruit drizzle cake. 
8th July was my first day of unemployment. 
July was in general quite calm. One day there was a langos truck at Kvilletorget and the queue was wrapping around the block. Not much else exciting happening in summer during a pandemic. We sat on a picnic blanket with David Gilblom and Laika was scared of a giant Bernese Mountaindog puppy, while the queue of langos-hungry people grew and grew.
One day we tried to see comet Neowise from Ramberget, but Sweden in July is too bright to see any comet. 
I replayed all of Zelda Breath of the Wild and I never wanted it to end. 
My garden looked pretty good this year, but all I got in the end were some beans, some peas and a bit of mangold that didn't actually taste that nice. 
Building of the new Hisingsbron was proceeding quite quickly and it was fun to watch it take shape. 
One morning I went on a bike tour up along Björlandavägen and landed at Kippholmen, a lovely little bay that was completely empty that early in the day. I lay on the warm rocks for a bit and read Reaf Life by Callum Roberts, before cycling back home in time for lunch. I had a vague plan of doing that more often during my unemployment - just take the bike for long-ish bike rides to get some exercise and my head free, but that didn't really happen. But 2020 was the year that I seriously took up biking to go anywhere. Except for very few bus rides, I didn't use public transport the whole year.

### August 2020
Corona-numbers during summer were way down from spring, and we decided to have a little holiday after all. I found a nice-looking house on Björkö in the Northern Archipelago, and together with Chris, Stefan and Sarah we went there by Bus and ferry. Walking from the ferry stop to the house took about 30 min in lunchtime heat I think forever killed my desire to go on hiking holidays where you have to carry around all your stuff in a bagpack. The house was amazing and right in the middle of the little town on Björkö, 3 min from the only ICA on the island. We didn't do much, besides getting up quite early, eating breakfast and reading on the veranda, going for a walk and/or swimming, chilling in the afternoon and BBQing in the evening. It was the perfect summer break, and only 1h bus ride from home. Every day I got better at going quickly into the 16°C water and I LOVED the feeling and the freshness of the cool water and the waves. Laika did too, she was swimming with us every single day. I read a whole book (Station Eleven) during that week, and Duncan finished Humankind. I also made some cyanotypes of flowers and seaweeds and got the most tanned I've been in years. On a walk around the island we encountered some serious looking sheep. And in the minigold in the harbour we met a fat, fluffy cat that wanted belly rubs. Late in the evenings we went along the cliffs and watched the quiet ferries ping-poing between islands like some machines out of a Simon Ståhlenhag book.
We grew some oyster mushrooms in a kit we ordered online to see if a mushroom farm could be a business idea. One batch was good, then it went downhill. Abandoned the mushroom farm idea. But I also tried for the first time to make tempeh, and that was much more successful and longer lasting.
Duncan had an exhibition of generative plotter art at Llama Lloyds café. He even sold 2 of the prints (to Scott and Aurora), and it was the first (and only) time during 2020 that we saw many of our friends at once.

### September 2020

In September started working seriously on several projects. I started planning for a fungal technology-focussed newsletter and I developed a business plan for The Mycobrewery, which developed from a community fermentation hub into food production into fermentation innovation with consultancy. I met a lot of different people that had some advice to give and wrote up a business plan. I also started an advanced Swedish course that took place online three times a week from 7:30 to 9:00. It was fun and it felt good to get something done already early in the morning. 
We did several very long walks, one to the top of Hisingen (Kornhall), then over with the ferry to the main land and then up to Ytterby. Another one to Amundsö. Took the bus back because it was further than expected and it was super uncomfortable because it was so busy and crammed and of course no one was wearing face masks because that was not a thing Sweden recommended doing. 
We got a new matress that would hopefully cure Duncan's morning back pain. I continued doing many many different tempeh trials. Max near Lindholmen opened, and in the beginning we ate there once a week. The sunflowers on the balcony started blooming, while the leaves on the trees started turning red already.

### October 2020
A guy with a topbun from Uddevalla picked up our old IKEA beds, and we ordered a new bedframe to fit our new matress. My days were filled with business planning, product development, Swedish and coding practice, job interviews and seminars. I met Ville from Miso i Majorna and started thinking about getting a production space. Handed in my starta eget stöd application to Arbetsförmedlingen. Also applied for an Oatly job. 
Pawel moved to Kville and we made pineapple upside down cake and watched a lot of Great British Bakeoff. One weekend we walked with Chris all the way to Vättlefjäll and around the lakes there. Then I got a nosebleed and took the tram home with Laika. Duncan arrived 3 hours later, having walked a total 35 km on that day. 
In the Polish shop on Herkulesgatan I found proper Zwetschken and made a delicious Zwetchkenfleck. I also made Sauerkraut with red cabbage that was fermenting for almost 2 months in our living room. And sourdough baguettes after my dad's recipe. On a walk to Hökälla with Mikael we found fresh Giant Puffballs. Autumn turned the leaves into the most beautiful colours.

### November 2020
I had some more interviews for the Oatly job in November, and Duncan for Possible. Otherwise, November was pretty uneventful, grey and rainy. I put up the Christmas lights on the balcony already on 1st November.
I looked at several possible production places for the Mycobrewery, made some beautiful tempeh and crocheted a wooly hat. On the first frosty morning we walked around Hisingsparken.

### December 2020
More interviews for me and Duncan, and for both of us finally a job offer. The hard decision to agree to moving to Skåne, start a job at Oatly and put the Mycobrewery for now on hold. 
Duncan gave an online dataviz workshop at Datafest Tbilisi. 
Christmas was calm. Sending and receiving parcels was a bit of a pain this year, since literally everyone was sending their presents and the postal services all over the place were massively overloaded and understaffed. 
Pawel came over on the 25th and we drank Glühwein and chatted until late. First wine in a long time, but I didn't get any hangover. Most of the presents this year were either edible or soaps. I got Duncan a little keyboard numberblock and I got a voucher for nice scienc-y jewellery and e-books.
I gave some tempeh to Scott, Aurora and Chris and Aurora liked it so much that she ordered 25 packages for her and her friends, which resulted in a wild bean cooking and tempeh incubating in the mellandagarna.
The weather in December was perpetually grey, overcast, rainy and just above 0°C. Only 24 and 25 were wonderful with clear skies and crisp cold. 
In the last weeks of 2020, Duncan got massively into modular synthesisers and started ordering the parts. 
I was a bit under the weather just before New Year's Eve, but we didn't have anything planned anyway. It was just Duncan, Laika and me, eating a lot of cheese, watching a stupid quiz show and playing a game about fungi.
