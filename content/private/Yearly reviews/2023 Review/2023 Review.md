## January
2023 started with breaking my favourite plate :( 
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231171508.png)

We went to the vet to check out a little knot on Laika's ear, that turned out to be just a clogged pore. I got a boatload of ice cream tubs from Oatly to bring home. I started cataloguing my self-made clothes.

We had a Klimatavtal workshop to talk about some initiatives for the year. Went to Erikshjälpen to have fika and buy a shelf for Duncan's office corner that we transported home on the bus.

There wasn't much snow in Helsingborg, but some days were very cold and foggy. 
I walked along Landborgspromenaden, Laika led me to Bruket and I bought a nice kardamummebulle that I ate at the beach.

The nice Christmas lights at Söder stayed up until the end of January.

I also went to Malmö to attend a Hackathon for protein engineering at GOTO10. It was alright, but I was not interested to do the 24h thing, so I left in the evening and showed up again in the morning for breakfast and wrap-up. 

## February

We took the train to spend a weekend in Gothenburg and meet friends. After a winter in almost snowfree Helsingborg, it was wonderful to get a big load of snow on the first morning we woke up in GBG. Met Eva and Kennet in a cool bar in Majorna, then walked around Nya Varvet with Chris on the snowy morning. Had a few beers with Josh in a pub and joined a little party at Isak & Kallo's new place in Angered.

We also went to a dogcafé with Gina, Bailey and her two kids. It was SO sweet and Laika met Bailey again :')

Duncan went to a meditation and creativity retreat in Röstånga in Villa Söderåsen (9-12 Feb). 
I made a cool pair of trousers, the [Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md) (later on I extended the bottom a bit straight, so it wouldn't be quite so barrel-shaped).
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231173906.png)

A nice view when walking up the stairs in our house in Helsingborg. 
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174027.png)

And a nice view from our kitchen window in HBG.
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174118.png)

Some days in February were very nice and sunny, but of course there were some cloudy and foggy days. Very moody, especially when walking through the nice gamla kyrkogård near our home in HBG.

![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174325.png)

Duncan went to a synth meetups in Malmö and I went along for the day to have lunch and go to some shops. We met a guy he knew in a department store (John, who had *just* gotten married) and in the evening Duncan attended a concert in a cellar club where there was a sitar player and some guy who said he knows a count who can get us an apartment in Malmö. In hindsight, that was probably the point when we (or at least Duncan) decided that he really wanted to move to Malmö. 
Klimatavtal organised a politician's debate and from each party one person actually showed up and joined the discussion about sustainable transport in Helsingborg. Was quite interesting. As member of the comms team, I filmed the whole thing and put info about it on social media. 

## March
Got a haircut. Had a wonderful sunny day in early March in Copenhagen. I visited Jenny in her cute very Copenhagen apartment, walked around with Laika and then met up with Duncan (who had attended a modular meetup) for beers in the meatpacking district. 

![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175021.png)

Duncan got REALLY into Yogi tea. Got a little bit of snow in HBG. 
On a fairly soggy day, we took train and bus to Dalby Söderskog to visit Sweden's smallest national park. 
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175300.png)

I designed and made a sleeve for our ebook reader.
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175500.png)

We went to Malmö again for a Niels Frahm concert in Moriska Paviljongen and ate at Arous Damaskus *again*. Good stuff. 
Laika got a fancy muzzle for the upcoming train trip through Europe, since many countries require it. 

![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175649.png)

## April
I went to Gåsebäck film festival where I saw an interesting documentary about where the money for new oil exploration in the UK comes from. The festival was small but cool, and located in an industrial area. Nice to see that there are some things going on in HBG. Sad that no one I knew showed up (not even Klimatavtal people).

I made Laika a relaxation landscape.
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175906.png)


On 5 April we started our spring walk along Skåneleden from North to South. We started on a sunny morning at Vittsjö train station and walked about 25-30 km each day, stopping on the way to Hässleholm, in Hässleholm, near Tjörnarp (Jallahustruns), in Höör, and then took the bus and train back from Hörby. We were super lucky with the weather; generally it was very pleasant, often sunny and relatively warm, but we also got some snow dusting on some mornings, which was magical when walking through the forest. So many nice moments on this walk, we barely met any other people. Next time, no more matmuffins. Duncan's vegan sausage rolls were a hit though. Laika walked like a champ, still pulling strong on the leash at the end of each day (though she slept pretty hard every night). 
Another thing that I tried for the first time was taking the canicross leash. It worked really well! Great to have the hands free, and Laika usually had no problem walking in front and figuring out where the path went. 
RIP my orange puffer jacket that I had bought in the second hand shop and was perfect for the walk, but that I then washed after the walk, which completely destroyed it :(

Got a nice Easter care package from M&P. Duncan and I had fondue at Chay, which is quite something. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181009.png)

Went to Fredriksdal to look at the animals, including supercute new lambs.
Spring had clearly arrived in HBG when we came back - flowers everywhere. The cherry blossoms were blooming around the library and in Furutorpsparken.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181353.png)

We spent our anniversary weekend in Copenhagen, staying at a cosy Airbnb in Norrebro. Had potato pizza. Went to a Yo La Tengo show in an old (porn?) cinema. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181452.png)

We also went back to Tjörnarp one Saturday to complete the last leg of Skåneleden, which we had skipped on our walk because it would've been too much for a day. Took the chance to eat again at this amazing pizza place in Höör that we had discovered on our walk. 

## May
We saw the First of May parade from Sosserna walk past our window. Had pizzalunch outside in glorious spring weather - HBG showing itself from its best side.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181856.png)

After much nudging from Duncan I brought a (old model) Theromix home from work to test it out. Eurovision happened, and even though Finland was MUCH better, I'm not unhappy that Sweden won (yay, Loreen!). 
Got Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Switch. What a game.
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182329.png)
It got pretty warm halfway through May. I bought the first watermelon of the year and made loads of iced coffees with crushed ice in the Thermomix. Rapeseed fields all over Skåne and tulips in Slottshagen were blooming.

At the end of May our 3 week train trip through Europe started!
Helsingborg to Helsingör by ferry, then train to Copenhagen and from Copenhagen to Kolding. 
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182529.png)

We visited the Miniby in Kolding, and a kind of botanical garden. 
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182631.png)

The next day we went to Hamburg and stayed over in hostel with a kind of Fritz Cola theme. Had fantastic Vietnamese food and walked through the Speicherstadt, but also found Hamburg - especially around the station - a bit unpleasant and crowded. 
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182843.png)

Continued to Osnabrück, which we unexpectedly liked very much. It had nice houses and old buildings and was kind of cute. Lots of fair trade and alternative tea/yoga shops. I bought a baobab tree sapling for me and for Christian's upcoming birthday. Duncan bought a cool backpack made out of a car airbag and a seatbelt.

![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183131.png)

Next day, train from Osnabrück to Amersfoort, and then further to Utrecht. Very pleasant connection.
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183056.png)

I loved Utrecht. The weather was great, the houses cute, the canals picturesque, the people all on bikes and the flowers next to the houses in full bloom. Duncan attended a conference for 2 days, and I mostly walked around with Laika. We had Indonesian food, breakfast in adorable cafés and good ice cream.

## June

On 2 June we continued onwards to Rotterdam, where we changed into a train to Brussels. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183832.png)

From Brussels to Luxemburg was a really pleasant, calm trainride through the south of Belgium - rolling hills and small forests, cool train carriage, PERFECT! But then just before the Luxemburg border we got put on a rail replacement bus that was really full and hot and unpleasant. Oh well.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112013.png)

Luxemburg itself was great. Quite spectacularly placed city with a big ravine separating the old town from the more modern part. Free public transport. Fantastic pizza and ice cream. More German-feeling city than I had expected, but also very French. Weird mix. And the dialect sounds crazy, like a perfect mix of German, French and something else.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112150.png)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112310.png)

Onwards with the train to Koblenz, where we would catch our overnight train to Innsbruck. The train ride was very pleasant, going mostly along the Mosel river past vineyards and old castles. Then unfortunately we got stranded at a random train station again with no information about rail replacement services. One completely full bus left and bus driver couldn't tell us when or if there would be another one. So we just waited with a bunch of other confused people, hoping that there would be a bus in time to catch our connection in Koblenz. About half an hour later, a bus arrived and we got on it and arrived in Koblenz on time, only to see that our night train was massively delayed. Had a beer in a pub, then checked back - more delays. Spent some hours in the train station, but Laika was very unhappy there. Finally we checked into the cheapest hotel next to the station and set our timer for hour intervals to not miss the train updates. Finally, the train was completely cancelled at 3 am. Ugh. Managed to book us on a day train to Innsbruck leaving at 9 am. Met Duncan's parents at Innsbruck train station, then arrived in Fulpmes in the afternoon. Met up with Mama, Papa and Luna, and Angie and Chris the day after. 

We went to a nice waterfall, and up the mountains in cable cars, and down the mountains in Sommerrodelbahn. We carried the dogs through cow herds, ate Käsespätzle and Topfenstrudl and drank holy spring water and Buttermilch mir Preiselbeeren.

The weather was generally really good, it only poured a few times. It was very nice to see family and to hang out together in the same place for a week after being on a train every day for the past week.

After a week we said goodbye to Duncan's parents and Angie and Chris, and went to Zipf to spend another night there.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113637.png)

Then we took the train to Munich, stayed a night there, and continued on to Berlin for 3 nights. Munich was ok, Berlin was great. The only bad thing was the sticky stuff from all the linden trees that was caked on the pavement and stuck to Laika's paws and tail. But the food was great, Tempelhof was interesting in a very solarpunk way, we spent a morning bathing to gentle techno beats in Liquidrom, met up with Max Graze for food, chat and ice cream, and Duncan got new glasses.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114029.png)

Next stop was Lübeck, where it was very warm. Pretty, old town centre and exciting to finally see the Holstentor in reality. Found a great Korean place and a nice Afghan place in a shady inner courtyard. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114219.png)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114232.png)

Then we took a short bus to Travemünde and embarked on the ferry to Malmö. Our cabin was very cosy and the trip was really restful. Slept great! And arriving in the morning under the Öresundsbron was super cool!

We spent midsommar with Luciane at Fredriksdal in Helsinborg.

Duncan went to Norrköping for a sonification conference and really liked it there. 

## July
Pawel visited on his way back from Portugal-Sweden bike trip that he had started at the end of February, and brought Duncan some nice Lego for his 39th birthday.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114652.png)

I got the tiniest tick in the world and fermented some unusual fruits from the Asian shop: bottle gourd and a green papaya. 

Max visited us in Helsingborg and we went to Fredriskdal and Pålsjö skog. Laika enjoyed some swims in the sea.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114951.png)

Duncan and I organised few walks for Klimatavtal, and we walked to Råå together with Luciane and her husband Amit. Met Margit there. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115108.png)

Tried fermenting water melon rind, but that didn't turn out great. Made a [Donny shirt](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt.md). 
We started looking actually for apartments in Malmö and went to a few viewings. 
I went to Kouvola in Finland to do a trial for Oatly's gurt 2.0 at FFF. Lot of driving and waiting, long evening and a very early morning.

Chris visited us in Helsingborg and we went to Helsingör and walked through Danish forests.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115530.png)

Got nice Fairphone headphones and a customised Heinz ketchup bottle for my birthday. And we went for a nice lunch to Chay. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115626.png)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115638.png)

Then we headed to Röstånga to spend a night in Villa Söderåsen. Both to enjoy a weekend in the forest and to check out the place for a possible 40th birthday celebration next summer/autumn with our families.

## August
I went to a viewing of an apartment in Malmö, was on spot 19 of the botplats queue initially, and for some miraculous reason we actually got it. Yay!

Big storm and flooding of fox valley in HBG.
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120025.png)

Duncan went for a weekend to Stockholm for a Norns coding workshop. 
We went on another Klimatavtal field trip from Glumslöv to Landskrona, and only two girls from a hiking in Skåne facebook group showed up. Was still nice though.

Duncan bought a bright red electric guitar on Blocket. 
Lisi visited me at Oatly to present a glucose and maltose sensor. 
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120309.png)

At the end of August, Duncan left for a 2.5 week UK trip to visit family, Possible colleagues, go to Andrew Lewis' wedding and going to Wales to visit his relatives. He took the train via Brussels, which was a bit stressful because of German train problems and delays. 

Papa came to Helsingborg.

## September
Papa and I walked to Råå, Pålsjö skog and Sofiero, went to Lousiana museum, and spent a day in Malmö. We also cooked nice food and Papa helped fix some holes in the wall in preparation of moving out.

When Duncan came back from the UK, he got Covid and spent 10 days in bed, mostly in the bedroom. We successfully isolated from each other so I didn't actually catch it.

## October
We sold our grey IKEA Friheten sofa. Great sofabed, but 90% of the time we just used the chaise-longue, and we thought it was too chunky for the new apartment in Malmö.
Got the keys to the apartment!

Went on a Netherlands train trip with Mama (5-11 Oct). We met up in Osnabrück and had a nice day there. We walked through the city, the botanical gardens, and visited an art gallery in a fomer church that had a lot of electronic trash piled up in big tubs. Mama was very interested in the motherboards, because she used to build them back when she worked at Eltrona.

On the second day in late afternoon, we took the train to Amersfoort. Amersfoort is super cute, with a nice historical centre, a huge churchtower that we climbed (including a carillon that we got showed how to play), lots of shops and restaurants, people everywhere on foot and bike, and a vibrant market on a Saturday. We stayed in the Hotel de Tabaksplant and went out to eat in an Asian fusion restaurant that served us meat not once but *twice*, even though we had ordered from their vegan menu.

We took a daytrip to Rotterdam, where we looked at a lot of cool architecture (cube houses, Markthal, design museum) and did a boat tour around the port. I also bought a bright orange wholly hat.

On the next day we went to Den Haag and walked all the way past the International Court of Justice to Scheveningen beach. Had some vegan cake and coffee, and walked back. Had AMAZING Chinese noodles in a place called Xi'an delicious food.

Last day was Utrecht, where we mostly just walked around the centre in the warm October sun.

We went back to Osnabrück for the night and parted ways. I came back on the train via Hamburg, Neumünster, Copenhagen, Helsingör, and took the ferry back to Sweden.

Angie and Chris went on honeymoon to Bali.

Duncan and I went to the new apartment in Malmö to bring a few plants, install the router and inspect the walls. I wasn't very happy with the state of the walls (lots of non-white fixed holes), but there was not enough time to paint everything before the big move.

Got loads of apples from Kerstin's apple trees in Helsingborg. I made many jars of äppelmus and a very pretty apple pie.

## November
We were very quick in unpacking 80% of our stuff in the first 3 days (and then the remaining 20% took about 2 months) and getting settled into the new apartment. Very nice autumn days, exploring Pildammsparken, going to Far i Hatten for pizza, Mitt Möllan for bento boxes, Scandwich for trendy sandwiches, Farina for amazing bread and the Möllevågnstorget market for fresh veggies. Also 500 times to Clas Ohlson to buy various hooks and sticky things and showerhead tube and boxes for cupboards, etc.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171344.png)

It took me a while, but I bought a very nice pair of jeans from Nudie jeans. I also fixed all our curtains because the apartment in HBG had much higher ceiling and we needed to shorten the curtains. I also started a guitar course to learn how to play the electric guitar.
Malmö FF won the Swedish league and the fans walked right past our house.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171321.png)

I bought a sofa at a second hand shop for 200 SEK, we got it transported home by a nice Syrian guy for another 350 SEK, the had pizza from 400 Grader on it. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171508.png)

I went to the city library with Tessa and Konstantin. Isak & Buffy visited, and we went to Plan B to see some bands, including Arab Strap. A week later we went there again to see Subways and Ash. 
Then Mikael, Siri and Tage visited and we went to Mitt Möllan and Folkets Park. 

Had to go back to the HBG apartment several times for a flyttstäd nightmare, because the Balder lady didn't approve how the städfirma cleaned. In the end I fixed it myself. 
We also went to Sofiero, which was very nice. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171803.png)

Got an air purifier. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171834.png)

Met Carlos from our building and his Samoyed puppy Aurora for a playdate near Jesusparken.

It snowed! A LOT! (28 Nov) We went for a walk at 10:30 pm around Pildammsparken just to enjoy the new fluffy snow. And it stayed really cold for 1-2 weeks, so the snow stayed on the ground for quite a while and it was wonderful.

## December
Laika got little snow boots!
![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102174130.png)

We went to Gothenburg for the weekend (mostly to pick up the Tubble, but also to see friends) and we got stopped SO much on the streets and shops just because of Laika's cute shoes. 
Hung out with Chris, did a escape room board game and tried miracle berries with a load of sour things. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102172603.png)

We went to Eva & Kennet's Christmas party, then a morning walk around Lindholmen and lunch at Barley's with Scott, and ate dinner with Josh in a very nice place at Stigbergstorget (Skeppet). Eva and Kennet were the same as always, had just come back from Japan (which they didn't entirely love), Josh was over but maybe not really over Helen and talked a lot about Warcraft and his new job at RISE, and Scott and Aurora are appartently trying for a baby right now. We met Stefan & Sarah for lunch at Benne Pasta - Morgan had just turned 1 and they had moved to Vågmästareplatsen. In the afternoon on Sunday we also hung out with Pawel, who had also started at RISE not too long ago and was grumpy that his Loquart seed had not sprouted as well as mine had. 
We picked up the Tubble!

Then we had a partially horrible trainride back to Malmö because Laika had had a bad stomach for the previous week, and around Halmstad she started shaking and panicky looking for a poop spot. I forbid Duncan to jump out of the train on the platform in Laholm and spent an hour with a continuously more frantic dog near the door until she finally pooped on a napkin (and partially on my hand). 

Malmö was icy and cold and Stora Pildammen froze over completely (lost a bet to Duncan).

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173401.png)

Then it got warmer again and all the ice and snow disappeared. We bought a Christmas tree and had fancy vegan 5-course Chinese dinner at Kin Long to celebrate my new job title (Principal Scientist in Enzyme and Fermentation Technology) and Duncan's award from the Dataviz Society for community engagement. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173453.png)

Got cherry cheesecake at Konstantin's place because it was his 40th birthday (same birthday as Angie! 14 Dec). 
I tested Covid positive on 16 Dec after attending about 3 work Christmas gatherings the days before. Spent a few days in bed and a few more just at home. First time I've been sick off work since I started at Oatly. No fever, just headache and sore throat and a bit generally ill feeling. 

Got new chairs for the dinner table and a bamboo bench for the hallway.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173803.png)

As usual, Austrian Christmas dinner on 24 and British Christmas lunch on 25.
![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173857.png)

Duncan got a nice baseball cap, a fancy glass tea mug, bass equipment and an apple corer. I got a turquoise guitar amp, an e bow, invitations to several nice restaurants and a course at a pottery place nearby. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102174054.png)

To avoid bangers and fireworks in Malmö we booked a place in Skillingaryd in Småland (28 Dec - 2 Jan). The train ride there was again less than ideal, because there were two cats on our 4-seater and Laika spent the whole 2 hours vibrating with adrenalin and trying to get closer to their transport boxes. 
We had two days of rain in Skillingaryd, but then it snowed and cooled down at it was very nice to walk in the woods. Laika had bad stomach again for a day, but this time we just starved her for a day and fed her Canikur and that seemed to do the trick instantly. Duncan got a massive migraine on 30th, but was fine again on 31st. 
Happy New Year 2024!
