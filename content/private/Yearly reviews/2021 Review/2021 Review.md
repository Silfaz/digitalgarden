2021; The pandemic went on with most of Europe being in various lockdowns and constant mask wearing, while Sweden still pretended there was nothing unusual going on. 
Covid vaccines rolled out, some pretentious billionaire-arseholes went to space, a cargo ship was stuck in the Suez canal for a week, the Austrian government was involved in several scandals about chat protocols, insider jobs, nepotism, etc. Chancellor Kurz quit, and with him half of his buddies. Prince Philip died, Republican lunatics stormed the Capitol, the world got hotter, Americans withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years war. 
In personal news, I started my job at Oatly, Duncan started at Possible, Laika got puppies, Mama & Papa got a dog, we moved to Helsingborg, I published several of my "Filaments" newsletter articles, Duncan released his Loud Numbers podcast, and Angie & Christian got engaged. 

## January
Duncan's first day of Possible was on 6th January. Laika was in heat in the middle of January and we went to Blå Stjärnan to get her checked. Then everything went pretty quick: Birgitta panicked, Thomas picked Laika up (15 Jan), brought her back 6 hours later and they sent a video about the "lovemaking". Job done. 
I went to Landskrona to check out the city and visit some apartments that were for rent to have somewhere to stay during my upcoming new job. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/2021-01-14 14.30.23 1.jpeg]]
One of 5 visited seemed nice (the others were too dark, too smoky, too annoying landlord, and too big), and I agreed to take it on the same day: Murargatan 10.
Duncan started to REALLY get into modular synth.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_20210107_223501.jpg]]
We kept observing Laika's nipples for most of January, to determine if she was pregnant. I made a nice green dress that I wore on the first day of work (together with the only time so far that I wore a blazer to work).
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_20210125_102358.jpg]]
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/first day at oatly.jpg]]
My first days at Oatly were actually the virtual introduction days. I received some merch to prepare for it:
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/oatly merch.png]]
Someone stole some stuff out of our cellar compartment (including my hiking boots and hiking backpack). Ausra got a baby (Martina). I got new glasses. 



## February
4-7 February was (virtual) Outlier conference which Duncan helped put together. 
Still not sure if Laika was pregnant. 
I started going to Landksrona once a week to stay overnight in my little apartment on a (surprisingly comfortable) air matress that I borrowed from Punchalee. No other furniture though. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/LKR apartment.jpg]]
The lake in Hisingsparken froze over and kids were playing ice hockey on it. We actually had quite a nice winter, most of January, February and March were quite cold.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Hisingsparken 02.png]]
And there were large ice sheets on the Göta Älv.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/ice sheets in Göta Älv.jpg]]
By that time I still hadn't had a goodbye party at Chalmers (because of Covid), so finally on 20th February Johan, Pawel, Scott and Aurora came for a walk and a falafel rulle at our favourite falafel place at Wieselgrensplatsen. They gave me a big flowerpot that had been decorated by Indbio people and a Chalmers tote bag. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/falafel.jpg]]
We climbed the hill behind Backaplan - Arödsberget and looked around with binoculars.

## March
Does that look like a pregnant dog?
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/pregnang.jpg]]
We played a lot of Gloomhaven online with Chris (through Tabletop Simulator). Bascially all other friend activities were walks, walks, walks. I worked occasionally on the AA9 manuscript I still wanted to publish together with Monika, which took foreeeeever (not my fault...).

Duncan proceeded on his modular synth journey and started soldering his first module (25 March). 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Duncan soldering.jpg]]
And Laika got puppies!!! Lipton, Lexie and Luna were born on 16 March.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Laika puppies.png]]
Almost equally important, Duncan got a Tubble!
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/tubble.jpg]]
I sewed a beige T-shirt that turned out only alright, and then I made a second one with adjustments that I liked much better. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/stefan tshirt.jpg]]
We walked through Nya Varvet with Eva and Kennet and ate waffles at a church. We also walked 26 km through Torslanda and Volvoland.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/torslandawalk.png]]

## April
Duncan and Pawel ran twice a week for a while. We attended a virtual Grandaddy concert, which was lovely - basically Jason Lytle in his little home studio. On Easter Sunday we went on a big walk through Bellevue, along the Säveån, and discovered the legendary Ove's Gatukök, where we had lunch.
15-17 April we walked all 75 km of Gotaleden with Pawel. We stayed overnight in Jonsered and in Nääs Fabriken. Duncan took a gigantic cheese and onion pie with us that lasted for days. We had fantastic weather (cold enough to not sweat, but warm enough to not have to wear winter jackets) and the whole walk was really enjoyable. Saw loads of beaver chewed trunks along the river. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Gotaleden.jpeg]]
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/gotaleden 02.jpeg]]
Duncan had a lot of talks about his Loud Numbers podcast and got some merch.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/loud numbers.png]]
We convinced my parents to get one of Laika's puppies (since they had been thinking about getting a dog for a while). They were worried about getting the dog back to Austria because of Covid restrictions. I thought it wouldn't be a problem. Oh how wrong I was. 
Duncan worked on "London under the microscope", a data visualization/sonification of Covid numbers in London with Valentina d'Efilippo.


## May
I made a top with a much too large collar. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/top.jpg]]
Hisingsbron was inaugurated and we walked on a red carpet over it.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/hisingsbron.jpg]]
We went to Helsingborg on 8 May, visited an apartment and walked around the city, getting used to the idea that this place will be our new home soon.
Birgitta chose the right dog for my parents, Luna!
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna.jpg]] 
And on 12th May they both came back to us. OMG SO CUTE!!! The first few hours she just sat under the kitchen table and was unsure about the new environment. Weeks of sleepless nights, so many trips outside, so many poops to clean up. Lots of fighting and playing with mum Laika. Such a mischevious dog that kept on escaping the pen. Too many cute photos to include here. Ok, one:
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna home.jpg]]
Ok, one more:
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna laika.jpg]]
Good thing that I could take several weeks of only working from home. I also took part in a pilot trial at RISE in Gothenburg, making feta and halloumi cheese. That was fun, and it meant that I didn't need to go to Landskrona but could work in GBG instead. Win win. 
We tried to give Luna as much socialisation as was possible during Corona. Of course we also went to Llama Lloyd. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_1120.jpg]]
And on the top of Ramberget.

## June
Loud Numbers launch!       
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X17zV8-4CdI&t=6476s
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/loud numbers 1.png]]
I made a top out of double gauze. So light and breezy. But it ripped on second wear.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/top2.jpg]]
We celebrated Nationaldagen with princesstårta and watching Duncan's one-year-postponed citizenship ceremony as a stream. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/nationaldagen.jpg]]
After a lot of considering and reconsidering about how to get a puppy to Austria, we finally decided that Mama & Papa should come to Sweden as soon as they are double vaccinated. so finally in mid June they arrived and stayed for 2 weeks to befriend Luna, learn dog 101 and take a lot of walks around Gothenburg. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/mama papa luna.png]]
Luna was a bit scared at first and even bit Mama in the ear when she got picked up. But over the next days they became good friends. Treats helped.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/treats.jpg]]
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/mama papa luna 02.jpg]]
We had burgers at Max and an epic downpour on the way home. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/downpour.png]]
We also had pizza at Dirty Dough that had glass from a lamp in it. Not our favourite pizza place in GBG any more...
On 27 June we met all of Laika's puppies on a meetup.
I made trousers (and shorts with the same pattern) that I wore all summer long.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/trousers.jpg]]


## July 
On Duncan's birthday we went with Chris on a trip to Hönö and a boat tour to Vinga. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/vinga.jpg]]
We walked along Gullbergsvass with Eva and Kennet and had burgers for lunch (then it started pouring).
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/gullbergsvass.jpg]]
We paid off the second third of our mortgage. Hooray! Laika and I celebrated with a (non-alco) beer on the balcony.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/balcony beer.jpg]]
As a little, relatively Covid-safe holiday activity, we took the slow train to Borås and spent the day walking around. We had nice mezze tallrik lunch and a sit-down in the park. The train ride was definitely the highlight of the trip. Open windows, rolling through the forest, no other people in the carriage - bliss.
Another afternoon I went to Kinna on my own and had a little shopping spree at an enormous fabric outlet.
We visited Bailey and Gina in their new house in Björlanda.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/bailey.jpg]]
A big part of July was spent packing things into boxes. I freaked out several times because we have SO MUCH STUFF. 
On 29 July, we went to Helsingborg to pick up the keys to our new apartment. 

## August
On 2nd August we moved to Helsingborg. We payed a moving company that showed up an hour too early, then halfway through packing up they complained that the entrance was too far away from the car and that they would have to charge us extra or we help. So we helped. Then took the train with Laika to Helsingborg, went to the new apartment, helped unload everything. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/move.jpg]]
On 4 August we took a nice walk through our nearby water reservoir/green area, saw a fox family and henceforth the area was called Fox Valley (even though we didn't see the foxes ever again). The same day we went to IKEA, had lunch there, and then took the train to Landskrona to stay over a last time in the apartment there. We had dinner on the beach.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/landskrona beach.png]]
The next day we took an early ferry to Ven and walked around the island. Laika wanted to hunt birds the whole time. Ven was very nice, sunny and hot (too sunny and hot for Duncan). We were some of the few people that walked, everyone else seems to be cycling on this island. It took half the day to walk around, then we had lunch and took the ferry back to Landskrona. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Ven.jpeg]]
We tried to test as many restaurants as possible in Helsingborg, as long as sitting outside was still okay to do. We discovered a fantastic vegan Vietnamese place (Chay), an amazing pizza place (Benchwarmers) and a great South Indian restaurant (The South Indian). And we also once had the great idea of skipping lunch and just having sweets at Sweet House Cafe. I had a fruit salad with ice cream and about 10 kit kats, while Duncan had ice cream rolls, which consistet only of ice cream - a whole soup bowl full of it.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/waffle house.png]]
13-15 August we went on a Skåne road trip with Chris. We stayed in a crazy Buddhist temple in the middle of the forest, called the Yangtorp Sanctuary. We visited Stenhuvud national park, Kivik, drank a lot of äppelmust and ate mediocre pizza.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/yangtorp.png]]
I took a Domestika course on how to mend clothes by stitching and started fixing Duncan's trousers that are all broken at the left knee.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/fixing.jpg]]
27 Aug we went to GBG for the day to get our second Covid shot!
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/2nd shot.jpg]]
I took up a freelance gig with Libre Foods, a start-up from Barcelona that wants to make mycelium-based meat. Very nice and overly ambitious CEO, who is completely clueless about the science and realistic timelines. 

## September
Duncan's cousing Becky died, and the extended family had a memorial service via Zoom. The weather was mostly wet, and when we went on a walk through Pålsjö skogen, we saw SO many mushrooms!
I sewed a boxy jacket (with lining!) with the light blue cordoroy I bought in Kinna.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/stacker jacket.jpg]]
At the end of September I took the train to Austria. This time daytime instead of night train. It was all fine, but 18 hours wearing a facemask was quite exhausting. Didn't drink or eat much during the whole travel. 
Austria was very nice, and still late-summery (25C) while Sweden was already firmly in autumn. Hung around a lot with Luna in Zipf, visited Tante Angela, Tante Gerti and Onkel Harald, took a trip to Attersee and saw the mountains. Then drove in Angie's new little red car to Vienna. Met up with Stefan, Stephan and Petra in Augarten, then went to a Beisl with Biergarten. This is one of the main things I miss from Austria: the ease to hang out with friends, talk about everything and nothing, have a beer and let the afternoon pass, take the U-Bahn home. Omg, and the bakeries! 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna + family.jpg]]
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/augarten.jpg]]

## October
We went to Bosses Mattor to pick up some rugs for our new apartment, since it's so much bigger and has a lot of empty floor. So many ugly specimens in this shop! But we found two decent ones: a round one from very nice grey wool, and a rectangular one that looks like the scraggly rocks of Bohuslän.
Early on a nice Sunday we took the ferry to Helsingör and walked around for 4 hours. Cute little city, but loads of "to let" signs in shop windows. We found an excellent bakery and took some bread back for lunch.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Helsingör.jpg]]
We met my colleague Kerstin's dog Hero and went for a walk with them, then got a lot of apples from Kerstin's garden that I made into apple pie and apple compot. I also grew Koji on oat residues from work to try to make some kind of shoyu. 
We walked to Pålsjö skogen again and had mushroom and tomato soup in the little pavillion restaurant on basically their last day of the season. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/pålsjö.jpg]]
We had the first visitor in Helsingborg - Munir, an old uni friend of Duncan's who now lives near Falkenberg. 


## November
We took a long walk down to Råå, past Planteringen and through tallskogen. Nice area, but not really much wild nature. 
Sewed the same trousers for me and Duncan to be able to lounge in style.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/tula pants 02.jpg]]
Went to a little outside fika organised by our housing organisation Balder and complained about the cigarette smoke smell in our kitchen, the broken door to the laundry room, the constantly open front door (because someone stuffs cigarette butts into the lock) and a missing bike room. They were actually quite receptive, and some of those things were fixed quite quickly (though the cigarette smoke probably disappeared because our neighbours moved out).
In mid November we went to GBG for the weekend and stayed at Clarion Post Hotel to treat ourselves. Duncan really wanted a bathtub, since the new apartment's bathroom is much too small to fit the Tubble (which has been parked in the cellar compartment in GBG since August...). We arrived when the big ribbon on the hotel was being illuminated for the Christmas season. There are so many more people in Gothenburg than in Helsingborg! 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/clarion.jpg]]
The room was not quite as nice as I'd hoped (probably because we needed the dog room) and the bathtub was only half size, but the breakfast buffet was quite good. We met Matt for an early walk, where we got completely drenched, then I met Johan for fika, then Chris in his apartment, and then I went to Dan's PhD defence pary in the student pub. I was hesistant to go at first, because of Corona and also because I didn't know how many Indbio people I would still know, but it was actually quite nice. On Sunday we had a walk with Isak on Hisingen, then had lunch with Scott and then I met up with Ausra for a walk through Slottsskogen. In the evening we had takeway Indian biryani that was so spicy we had to abandon it.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/GBG.jpg]]


## December
At the beginning of December, Duncan flew to England for the first time in over two years to see his family and meet his Possible colleagues. Laika and I had the first snow in Helsingborg, which we both LOVED, but sadly it was gone again two days later. 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/snow.jpg]]
I had a 3-day work trip to Tetra Pak in Aalborg to test some cheese mixing equipment with my colleagues Yoga and Magnus. It was quite exhausting because our host talked without a break, and we "had" to attend a dinner in a completely packed Italian restaurant. It was very odd to be in a packed restaurant again after 2 years of more or less self-isolation, and I was sure I would catch Covid there, but I don't think I did. 
December was - as expected - very dark, grey and wet/cold, so quite unpleasant and depressing. We bought some additional lamps to light the apartment. After 3pm it was hard to see my face in online meetings, because it was so dark at my desk. 
Out of longing for Christmas traditions and a bit of homesickness, I made a lot of Christmas cookies (but regretted it halfway through baking, as is always the case). 
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/kekse.jpg]]
We found a hunddagis near us and tried Laika for 2 half days, which worked fine, so we signed her up for 2 days a week from January.
On Christmas it was just the three of us. We had sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes on the 24th, and tempeh Wellington on the 25th. 
I got Duncan a Thobe from a nice, stretchy bamboo fabric, and he got me a monthly sock subscription for 2022, and two nice cookbooks (Ottolenghi, Meera Sodha). Mama sent a finished dress that I didn't manage to sew by myself, and Papa sent a USB stick with childhood photos.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/thobe.jpg]]
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Christmas 2021.jpg]]
We took a walk to Bruce's skog on Boxing Day. And we played a lot of Squash during the mellandagarna in our newly discovered squash place in the centre.
![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/bruce.jpg]]
New Year's Eve we spent at home on the sofa. At 12:00 we went to bed and watched the fireworks through the bedroom window.
