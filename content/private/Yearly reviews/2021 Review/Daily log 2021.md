Dress down Christmas tree and remove Christmas decorations
Clear out cellar a bit. We discovered that someone had tried to steal something from our cellar compartment and had removed a bag of books (but then decided that it wasn't worth taking and spilled it on the floor).

#### 9 January
Nice sunny, cold day. The snow is still on the ground and we took a walk (10:30-12:00) with Chris, Natasa and Murray. Murray was even more excited than usual, because Laika is in heat right now. 
Work: Filaments episode 3 writing
Looked at a lot of apartments in Helsingborg and Landskrona and intressanmälade many, only to realise that this is probably completely pointless because it just _feels_ like I'm making progress, but don't actually have a realistic chance for any of these apartments. New plan: make a blocket ad and go for 2nd hand contract. 
Felt a bit sad in the evening about moving and being apart from Duncan and Laika for what will probably be longer than I think. Lonely evenings in a bleak room, etc. I'll need to make some good plans to not fall in to an "Ås-hole" and have some nice things to do for the evenings: reading, yoga, listening to music, coding, etc. 

#### 10 January 
Work: Filaments episode 3 writing (how is this taking so long??!!)
Cooked: Pizza and vegan brownies
Walked up Långängen. It was super icy. 
30 min yoga with Duncan in the evening. 
Got an idea to look into capsule wardrobe for work, since I just started wondering what kind of dresscode (if any) there is at Oatly and what I want to represent with my clothes. Do I still want to show up in quirky Threadless T-shirts, colourful tights and sneakers? Time to find a good style! 
A&C's cat Darwin had to go to the vet hospital, since he hasn't been eating for several days. Not sure what's wrong with him. 
We started doing a Google Sheets tutorial https://courses.benlcollins.com/courses/222121/lectures/3583529 that seems very useful. 

#### 11 January 
Work: Finished Filaments episod 3
Arranged some apartment viewings in Landskrona on 14 Jan. Suddenly I got responses from about 5 or 6 places. Seems like everyone's back from their Christmas break now, and it might actually be quite easy to get something in either Landskrona or Helsingborg (still nothing showing up from Lund though).
Walked around Kville and up Kvillebäcken. It was rainy and all the snow disappeared.
Ordered a lot of basics from Muji that would work for some work outfits. Also ordered two blazers from Zalando to try on. My first blazers ever. 
Two people showed up that responsed to my Facebook/Instagram post about giving things away. They took some boardgames, chopsticks, floor cleaner, etc.


#### 12 January
Made berbere (this recipe https://www.daringgourmet.com/berbere-ethiopian-spice-blend/). Also a lot of mealplanning for this and next week.
Arranged some more viewings for Thursday in Landskrona and booked trains. 
Also watched some videos about design solutions for small apartments. 
Dog walk with Ìsak and Buffy up Ramberget in the evening. 

#### 13 January
Blå Stjärnan Djursjukhus with Laika to get the checks Birgitta requires: eyes, hips, knees, blood test. For the hip x-ray she got sedated and she was getting sooo sleepy and it was the cutest thing. <3 Everything seemed fine with the results we got, but when I wrote Birgitta that she also might be in heat since a few days (weeks?) things got super stressful. Might have to go back to Blå Stjärnan to get some more tests done. 


#### 14 January
Managed to arrange 5 apartment viewings for one afternoon in Landskrona, so took the train in the morning. Weird being on trams and trains again for the first time in almost a year. About half of the people were wearing masks, but most took them off once they had boarded the train. 
Landskrona: Seems quite cute, loads of colourful Danish-style houses and brickbuildings. Nice water tower, everything's very walkable. Not so many shops or restaurants visible, but I didn't quite reach the city centre (or the waterside). 
Apartment 1: Nice and compact, clean, new windows, nice kitchen, fairly new bathroom. 
Apartment 2: About 10 people want to view it. Mother with two teenage daughters and a cat still live in it. Only mäklare today that required masks and handsprit when viewing. 
Apartment 3+4: Annoying landlord that tries to oversell his nice 1920s building: 5th floor without lift, old windows that can't be opened, not allowed to drill into the walls, etc. Everything's a bit stuffy and mucky and dark.
Apartment 5: Even through my mask I smell the cigarette stench in it. Kitchen window is right out onto the street and pavement. 
Back at the train station I wrote the mäklare of apartment 1 that I want it and later that evening I signed the contract. Yay! One worry less. Moving in date is 1 Feb, rent is 4067 SEK. 
Otherwise: Skåne is very flat, but had slightly more snow than GBG. I was incredibly cold the whole afternoon, just ambling around the city at -6°C for 5 hours. 

#### 15 January
Went to Blå Stjärnan again for Laika's progesterone test. Results showed that she is (was?) at the peak of the scale, which made Birgitta even more stressed and eventually her husband picked Laika up for some early evening hanky-panky with Destu. We'll know in a few weeks if it worked. Birgitta sent some videos of the "action"... 

#### 16 January
Spent the whole day editing Duncan's Loud Numbers. Bit complicated, because it has loads of soundbites and a conversation-style bit with Miriam, etc. 

#### 17 January
Another day with mostly editing the video. Almost done.
Skype with Hüttners. Angie's cat Darwin is at home and feeling better again. Papa's foot is still painful, Mama's shoulder is still painful. They're clearing out the attic a bit, which has been their main corona activity since March. Papa working on the Chronik, Mama exchanging slide frames from glass to plastic. 

#### 18 January
Cycled to Marklandsgatan to meet Ausra for a walk through Slottsskogen. Tires slipped on the ice and I fell, but in slow motion. Met Ausra's baby that is still just called Peanut and is now 2 weeks old. Got all the gruesome details of the birth, and the hard time during and after due to corona restrictions: she wasn't allowed to go to hospital until the baby was basically coming out, it wasn't sure if Marco was allowed in (he was eventually let in just for delivery), she was completely on her own for 4 days after birth because no one is allowed to visit, etc. 

#### 19 January
Easy day, mostly reading and watching Ugly House to Lovely House. Baked a vegan almond cardamom cake that was so-so. 

#### 20 January 
Another easy day. Planned a bit for Landskrona, like how I am going to sleep and how I will install blinds or curtains etc. I don't want to buy too much unnecessary stuff for that apartment, especially since it's going to be so temporary. On the other hand I want it really cosy and inviting, so I actually enjoy being there. And sleeping well is a BIG thing for me, esp. since I have not had a great night of sleep for half a year (I still blame the new matress). For the first nights though I have borrowed Punchalee's air matress. 

#### 21 January
Went to pick new glasses at Optikkällaren in the morning. Took me about an hour and dozens of photos/videos to pick one among 20ish shortlisted. Came back in the afternoon to get an eye test (left side slightly worse due to more astigmatism). Then optician told me that the glasses are too big for the glass I will get, so I should pick another pair. Took me another hour to go back and try to pick another pair. Finally came up with one, only for the optician to tell me I should stick with the original one. Arrgh. Now I'm doubting if the original ones were the right decison (are they too big??). Cost 4000 SEK. 
Weather: SUPERwindy and rainy, mostly for the times I was on a bike to and from the optician. Afternoon we had some spots of blue sky. 
Dinner: East African. SO GOOD.

#### 22 January
Slept on the air matress to test it out (with a matress topper on top). Much better than expected. Felt actually better than after most nights on the actual matress, less neck stiffness. 
Online Yoga session with some of the Possible crew. 
First online meeting with some of my new Oatly colleagues. About 30 will participate in the introduction days next week. It will feel odd to be part of a team again. I was worried that I might get quizzed about enzyme things in my first days, so I revised some basic things like amino acid codes. I never actually learned the one letter codes, let alone the structures or categories. Felt like I should probably know that as an Enzyme Technology Specialist.
Did some coding (trying to understand JS Promises and asynchronous functions). 
Lunch: Take away from Babemba food truck at Kvilletorget (Malinesian food). 
It snowed in the morning, but it was gone again by the afternoon. 

#### 23 January
Calm Saturday. Lots of sewing. 

#### 24 January
Finished sewing my nice Indigo dress with the bottle-green bird pattern. Turned out really nice, after I tucked in the sides a bit. 

#### 25 January 
Packed up some things for Landskrona. 

#### 26 January
Train to Landskrona to meet mäklare and get the keys. Her skånska was much less understandable this time, but I think I understood all the important things. Brought an airmatress to serve as semi-temporary bed. But I stayed the night in a hotel, because there are no curtains yet in the apartment. The hotel was basic and the room was quite cold (maybe they pumped up the ventilation due to Corona?). Walked through the centre in the evening to get some food. It was pretty empty, except for one small street with a busy coffeeshop on. Got Banh Mi, summer rolls and a chocolate muffin. Ate it in the hotel bed while watching Blown Away on Netflix. 

#### 27 January
1st day at Oatly! Pleasantly surprised that they actually take some serious Corona measures: temperature check at the entrance, mask requirements, limited presence, etc. Met Karin and she showed me around, but there were barely any people in the offices. Got my laptop and an HR introduction. Lunch with Karin (bit shocked that there are no vegan and barely any vegetarian options in the vending machine - need to talk to the sustainability department about that!), then sat in on a call with the new oat breeder. So much is happening in Swedish, think I will really need to up my game there. Had a peek in the lab, seems a bit small and crowded, but they're expanding the whole facility right now. Train back to GBG, pretty empty. Arrived at home at 20:00. 

#### 28 January
Oatly Introduction Days part 1: Presentations by sustainability, HR, etc. Nice chats in breakout rooms. The after work activities were slightly cringey and stressful. I participated in the quiz for my team, which went really well (2nd place). Wanted to show a trick with Laika, but she was sleepy and it failed. Felt stressed for hours after that! 

#### 29 January
Cold (-6°C) and sunny. 
Oatly Introduction Days part 2: Presentations by creative department, innovation, Toni, etc. Today I turned my camera off for most of the day, which was much less exhausting. Feeling good about starting at this company, they emphasise their sustainability thinking so much, that I hope it's actually true. 
Short call with my future colleague Johan Qvist made me realise that I have to really revise some of my enzyme knowledge. 
Dinner: Tried the new Indian/Pizza/Kebab/Somalian restaurant "Singh is Kinng" on Kvilletorget. Chana Masala and Dal Tarka. Not bad. Tastes quite homecooked, not as oily as most other Indian restaurants.

#### 30 January
Cold (-8°C) and sunny. Morning walk to Hornbach to buy some curtain rods to bring to Landskrona. Picked up my new glasses at Optikkällaren. Cooked dal and Ottolenghi. Otherwise calm day with 2h Skype call with M&P&A, telling them all about my first days at Oatly. 
Evening: Listening to Arlo Parks while solving Nonograms with Duncan <3 

#### 31 January
Cold (-10°C) and foggy in the morning, but already at 9:30 breaking up and getting sunny. We took a nice early walk in the fog and Laika's whiskers and eyebrows got all icy. 

#### February

What we left behind - DS9 documentary
AlphaGo documentary
Re-watching all of Parks & Recreation, mostly during my lonely evenings in Landskrona.
