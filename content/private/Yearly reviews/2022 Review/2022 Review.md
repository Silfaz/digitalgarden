## 2022
**01-01-2022**: Started the new year in bed, cuddling with Duncan and Laika, looking at the fireworks through our bedroom window, drinking äppel glögg and listening to the Donauwalzer.
**01-01-2022**: Signed up for HGB matkooperativet
**05-01-2022**: Got a new rice cooker! It has fancy settings like "Yumami" rice.
**07-01-2022**: Sky-high new Covid cases thanks to the Omicron variant. More than 30 000 in Sweden in the last 24h. Schools stay open, they say, and the "stricter" restrictions will be bars closing at 23:00 and recommendations to work from home. Went to Landskrona, still almost no one wears a mask on the train. 
**08-01-2022**: Played squash. Went to Pålsjö skogen with Vasmi from the Helsingborg Internationals Meetup group. 
**10-01-2022**: Duncan's Elevate membership program launched officially.
**11-01-2022**: Laika's first day in the hunddagis. Hope she likes it. 
**15-01-2022**: Little trip to Helsingör to meet up with Jenny Bååth. Very nice walk around the castle and the town.
**22-01-2022**: Went to Falkenberg and visited Munir's house in the countryside. Saw loads of birds in the garden.
**31-01-2022**: Got my 3rd Covid shot. My arm hurt so much in the evening that I didn't sleep well, then had a bad next day. Good thing it was a Saturday, bit of a lost weekend. But at least I'm fully vaccinated now. 
**01-02-2022**: Went to the vet with Laika for check up and to ask them if she could be pregnant, since there were some signs of heat, but we still kept her in hunddagis. Got an appointment for ultrasound on Friday.
**04-02-2022**: Ultrasound also says that Laika is not pregnant, and the vet thinks it's very unlikely that anything happened at the dagis. Phew! 
**10-02-2022**: Hired a window cleaner, since the longer and occasional sunny days really make the windows look super dirty. And they are the weird kind that flips inside out and is scary to do yourself. Half an hour and 350 SEK later they are sparkling clean! Best investement in 2022 so far.
**11-02-2022**: Started a little collaboration with Nina from the Elevate Membership program. We want to visualise something on maps. Will need to use my Python knowledge and learn some things about Open streetmap API, etc. 
**25-02-2022**: Angie visited for 4 days, Fri-Mon! We tried to take it easy but still managed to do a lot. Picked her up on Friday morning at the airport, then we looked for wedding-appropriate dresses in Copenhagen (didn't find anything), then took the train up to Helsingör, ferry over to Helsingborg, then tour through our apartment, then early dinner at Chay (first restaurant visit since Covid!!). Saturday, we went through Helsingborg, bit of clothes shopping in the centre, walked along the harbour, cooked nice dinner, watched The French Dispatch (didn't really like it). Sunday, we had a nice long morning walk along Tallskogsleden all the way to Råå, walked on the beach, then took the bus back. Played a lot of Zelda Breath of the Wild, cooked nice food again. Monday, she cut my hair, we went grocery shopping, then played some more Zelda and had a long walk through Fredriksdal. The weather all week was amazing (sunny and blue sky, and -2 to 6C).
