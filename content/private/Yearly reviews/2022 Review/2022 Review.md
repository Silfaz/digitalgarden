## 2022
### January
**01-01-2022**: Started the new year in bed, cuddling with Duncan and Laika, looking at the fireworks through our bedroom window, drinking äppel glögg and listening to the Donauwalzer.
**01-01-2022**: Signed up for HGB matkooperativet
**05-01-2022**: Got a new rice cooker! It has fancy settings like "Yumami" rice.

**07-01-2022**: Sky-high new Covid cases thanks to the Omicron variant. More than 30 000 in Sweden in the last 24h. Schools stay open, they say, and the "stricter" restrictions will be bars closing at 23:00 and recommendations to work from home. On the train to Landskrona, still almost no one wears a mask. 
**08-01-2022**: Played squash. Went to Pålsjö skogen with Vasmi from the Helsingborg Internationals Meetup group. 
**10-01-2022**: Duncan's Elevate membership program launched officially.
**11-01-2022**: Laika's first day in Hunddagis Gåsebäck. Hope she likes it. 
**15-01-2022**: Little trip to Helsingör to meet up with Jenny Bååth. Very nice walk around the castle and the town.

**22-01-2022**: Went to Falkenberg and visited Munir's house in the countryside. Saw loads of birds in the garden.
**31-01-2022**: Got my 3rd Covid shot. My arm hurt for two days.

Made a dress from a fabric I got from Ros for Christmas:

I tried some fermentations with oat residue from Landskrona. I mixed it with soybeans to make tempeh (worked ok and got nicely chewy). I also mixed it with koji rice to make a soy residue shoyu. Not entirely sure if I like the taste. 

### February
Laika being in the hunddagis resulted in her having kennelhosta once, and me having a pregnancy scare for her. I wasn't sure if she had been in heat, and still let her go to dagis, and then got paranoid that there couldn've been some unobserved dog sex in the hunddagis. Went to the vet, who said "probably not" but gave me a follow-up appointment for an ultrasound. Ultrasound also didn't show anything. Phew!

Laika really perfected the "I put my chin on their leg or the sofa or whatever and wait for food" move. Occasionally she honks like a goose while doing that.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%20Laika.jpg)

The flocks of birds in Landskrona were spectacular! I had to stop several times on my bike home from work to just look at the thousands of birds moving above me. Are they crows? Or geese? I still don't know. One morning I even convinced Duncan to come along with Laika on the morning train to work and walk with me a bit towards Oatly, just to experience the number of birds that hang out around there. 



I hired a window cleaner, since the longer and occasional sunny days really make the windows look super dirty. And they are the weird kind that flips inside out and is scary to do yourself. Half an hour and 350 SEK later they are sparkling clean! Best investement in 2022 so far.

I started a little collaboration with Nina from the Elevate Membership program. We want to visualise something on maps. Will need to use my Python knowledge and learn some things about Open streetmap API, etc. 


Angie visited for 4 days, Fri-Mon! We tried to take it easy but still managed to do a lot. Picked her up on Friday morning at the airport, then we looked for wedding-appropriate dresses in Copenhagen (didn't find anything), then took the train up to Helsingør, ferry over to Helsingborg, then tour through our apartment, then early dinner at Chay (first restaurant visit since Covid!!). 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2001%20Angie%20in%20HBG%201.jpg)

Saturday, we went through Helsingborg, bit of clothes shopping in the centre, walked along the harbour, cooked nice dinner, watched The French Dispatch (didn't really like it). 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2002%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2003%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)

Sunday, we had a nice long morning walk along Tallskogsleden all the way to Råå, walked on the beach, then took the bus back. Played a lot of Zelda Breath of the Wild, cooked nice food again. Monday, she cut my hair, we went grocery shopping, then played some more Zelda and had a long walk through Fredriksdal. The weather all week was amazing (sunny and blue sky, and -2 to 6C). Duncan had a migraine for most of the weekend :/ 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2004%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)


### March
Ukraine war started. 

I started a fermentation visualization project with Max from Elevate. We want to collect and show information about different dairy ferment from all over the world.

On the last of Laika's hunddagis adventure (before we took her out again because it didn't actually save us much time) we finally managed to take advantage of being dog-free. We took the day off, went over to Helsingør and walked to Humlebæk to visit the Lousiana museum. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%2001%20Trip%20to%20Louisiana%20museum.jpg)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%2002%20Trip%20to%20Louisiana%20museum.jpg)

On a sunny Sunday at the end of March we walked to Råå and had picnic along the way. Crocusses everywhere.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20Råå%20walk%2002.jpg)


I bought two jackets at Pingstkyrkan second hand, mostly for walks and hikes.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20Pingis.jpg)


### April
Norway train trip (1-6 April): We went by train to GBG and dropped Laika off to stay with Chris. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Trip%20to%20Oslo,%20Ede.jpg)

Then we went futher to Oslo, where we arrived at 2 in the afternoon. Walked around a fancy villa quarter until we reached the Frognerparken and Vigelandsparken. Had some hot chocolate surrounded by small birds. All over the city were Ukrainian flags, almost more than Norwegian ones. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Oslo.jpg)


Next morning we took the Bergensbanan. It slowly climbed up from Oslo towards the highest point in Finse. Almost unnoticeable the landscape turned from early spring back to snow and ice. We were in our cosy train, gliding through the white landscape. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Finse.jpeg)

In Myrdal we switched to the Flåmbana which crawled down the mountains along the World's steepest railway track to end up in the fjord village of Flåm. The landscape turned back to post-snow spring greyness. We stayed 3 nights at the Flåm Marina, with a beautiful few of the fjord from our window. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Flåm.jpeg)


One highlight was taking a fjord trip from Guldvangen to Flåm on the electric ship Power of the Fjords. It was very low and very quiet, and the whole trip felt like just gliding silently above the water. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20fjords.jpeg)

On the last day in Flåm, we walked halfway up the surrounding mountains. 

The next morning, the Flåmbana brought us back up to Myrdal. We had the whole carriage to ourselves, and Duncan took out his synth to compose something along the way.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Flåmbana%2003.jpg)

In the afternoon, we arrived in Bergen. The sun was shining and a blustery wind was blowing. We tried to see as much of the inner city as possible before it got dark. I really like the colourful houses, the rough sea, the views and the cute streets. We found an excellent vegan restaurant where we had a nice anniversary meal (10 years since Last.fm messages!!) and stayed over night in a hundreds year old hotel with dark wooden beams along the ceiling. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2001.jpg)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2005.jpeg)

The next morning, Bergen was covered in snow. After breakfast we walked to the station, and sat 7 hours on the train back to Oslo, going in reverse from slightly snowy landscape to icy plateaus to Oslo in the spring time. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergensbana.jpg)

We walked around some cool neighbourhoods in Oslo, had Indian food and stayed in a hostel without any (visible) staff. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Oslo%2003.jpg)

Then train back to GBG to pick up Laika, and we were back in HBG at 6 pm. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Train%20back.jpg)


Walk in Ramlösa brunnspark with Supansa and Johan Westman (former Chalmers colleague of mine). He works at Chr. Hansen and she's at Lund University. Their two small boys were quite wild.


Over the Easter weekend we walked Kullaleden. We started from home and started walking through Helsingborg towards Pålsjö skog and beyond, along the coast to Hittarp, Domsten, Viken and Höganäs. For a very long time, Kronoberg castle in Helsingør was still visible on its exposed position. The birds were screetching and there were very few people on the way. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2001.jpg)

After staying in a holiday home near the beach, we took the bus back to Helsingborg to pick up Duncan's phone charger. Then bus back to where we left off, and continued walking to Mölle. Realised that there was no supermarket in Mölle, so we took the bus back to Nyhamn to buy some things. Then back to Mölle. We walked up Kullaberg to the lighthouse in the afternoon. The whole forest smelled of wild garlic, which covered the ground everywhere. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2003.jpg)

We had halloumi burgers in a pub in Mölle harbour. Sadly, despite staying in the fancy Hotel Kullaberg, our room didn't have enough warm water to have a bath in the evening. The next day, we cut through Kullaberg, walked up Skånes highest point and continued on to Arild, Svanshall and Bläsinge, where we stayed over at a very charming hostel at the end of a very long plant nursery. I also bought a rock painted like a chick from a roadside cupboard.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2005.jpg)

On the last day, we walked along a looong sandy beach and sandy pine forests to Ängelholm, visited the UFO monument, had falafel rulle and took the train back home. Laika was a champion and walked all 100 km without any problems. She always had the energy to chase after little birds on the beach. 

Duncan bought me cucumber-flavoured ice lollies from the ice cream truck.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20Gurkis.jpg)


I sewed a mint green bolero jacket that goes with the dress I wanted to wear for weddings this year. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20bolero.jpg)


### May
Jenny, Josh and Helén visited us in HBG over the weekend. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20Visit.jpg)


Eurovision 2022 took place in Turin. Russia was excluded because of their invasion of Ukraine. We loved Romania ("Hola me bebebe, llamame, llamame.") and Moldova ("Kisinau, Bukarest!"). Sweden wasn't bad (Hold me closer), Finland sent The Rasmus (Jezebel), UK took second place (Spaceman) and Ukraine won (Stefania). 

England trip, Melissa & Nicola's wedding, Torquay: We went to England for 10 days to attend the Amoridge wedding. On the way to Gothenburg we dropped Laika off to stay with Isak, Callo and Buffy. We stayed in the quite subpar Hotel Eriksbergshallen and took a flight to Heathrow the next day. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%20trip%2001.jpg)

The weekend was all about family and wedding. We stayed in an amazing little bungalow with a hot tub and went into the hot tub about 6 times in the 3 days we were there. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2002.jpg)

The wedding was very nice - outside in a big garden, with the brides underneath a big tree. There was singing ("500 miles", Fabian), trumpes, poetry, pagean rituals and vegan catering (including a vegan cake buffet). Next day we all went on a walk across the fields to have a big pub lunch. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2003.jpg)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2003a.jpg)

On Monday morning we went to the small administrative wedding in Eastbourne, and then by train via Gatwick and Reading to Torquay. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2004.jpg)

We stayed in Duncan's parent's flat on Warren Road and took a nice long walk along the coast via Paignton to Brixham, found a cute café on the way and then took the boat back to Torquay. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2005.jpg)

Everything was preparing for the Queen's Jubilee Weekend, which was to happen the week after we were there. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2007a.jpg)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2006.jpg)

One evening we had dinner with Miriam and her husband in Totnes, and one day we went to Bristol. We walked through Bristol and over the Clifton Suspension Bridge, visited the zoo and power walked back to the station to briefly meet Duncan's Possible colleague before getting the train back to Torquay. We spent the last two day of our England trip in Reading, then flew back to GBG, picked up our dog, had lunch with Scott and Aurora and came back to Helsingborg.

### June
I joined the Community group for Matkooperativet and we had occasional meetings to plan some  member events, like a barbecue (that then never took place because of rain). 

We also joined Helsingborganas Klimatavtal - a little climate activist group consisting mostly of the same people as Matkooperativet. 

Chris visited for a weekend and we went with his car to the national park Söderåsen. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Söderåsen.jpg)

On Saturday, 11 June, we visited Karl, Frida and baby Alfred in Kungsbacka. We had a nice walk around the forest, grilled sausages at a lake and then visited their new house, which was heavily decorated with (only?) photos of the three of them. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Kungsbacka.jpg)

By later May/early June all of Helsingborg's parks had explosed into flowers, especially the Rhododendrons. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Flowers.jpg)

I made diary and plant-based yogurts in the rice cooker (pretty successfully). On some sunny, warm afternoons I hung out with Laika, a book and a thermos full of iced coffee in the park.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Park.jpg)

Scott and Aurora visited us in Helsingborg; we walked to Pålsjö skog and had ice cream in Gröningen. 

H22 expo was also taking place during June, but to be honest there was not much to do and we missed most of it. We attended one event about a sustainable mall, but it was quite bad. And we bought food at the food truck festival; it was rainy and about 10 C and we ate our food on a park bench. 

Duncan and his Elevate gang organized an online dataviz conference and I presented my mapping project of Gothenburg's street names: https://silfaz.github.io/gbgclusters/

This was at 10 pm on 21 June:

On midsummer, it was pretty warm and we had picnic in the park.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Midsommar.jpg)


### July
For Duncan's birthday weekend we went to Malmö and stayed over in a "bike hostel" (which looked more like a prison cell) near Turning Torso. It was the first proper time exploring Malmö: we let Laika run on the dog beach, had fantastic pizza (twice!) and walked through Möllevången and Folkets Park. We also met two of Duncan's Possible colleagues who came through to study good concepts of car-free cities. We had cake in the park and Laika chased a cat. We also explored Västra Hamnen and had the BEST strawberries from a small stand outside of ICA. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malmö.jpg)

Buffy stayed with us for a few days, which overlapped on the last day with both Duncan's family visiting and Chris staying over to go to a concert with us. It all worked out fine. The first concert after peak pandemic! The Sounds, Mando Diao and The Hives in Sofiero park. Really fun and chill, and the smoothest and most efficient leaving-the-venue experience I've ever had at a concert. 

Duncan's family (Ros, Edmund and later also Melissa and Nicola) stayed for over a week and we showed them everything: Helsinborg, Mölle, Helsingør, Malmö, Copenhagen.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20HBG%2004.jpg)

The weather was mostly great, I swam in the sea several times (despite it only being 16-18C) and we had a particularly good time in Copenhagen where we explored the less touristy parts like Nørrebro and the post-industrial area around the ski-slope-waste-incinerator Copenhill and the food truck place Reffen.

The weekend after we went to GBG to hang out with many of ours friends in the park (Stefan, Sara, Chris, Mikael, Siri, Josefine + boyfriend, Scott) for a little birthday picnic. 


### August

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Duncan%20and%20Laika.jpg)

The first weekend in August, Jonas and Lisa visited us from the Netherlands and stayed over a few days. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Jonas%20and%20Lisa.jpg)

I participated in the big Oatly oat harvest for the oat breeding group in a field near Lund.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Oat%20harvest.jpg)

I made a self-drafted summer dress. Duncan sold his bike that had been standing unused in the cellar for 1.5 years and then bought a bass guitar.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Dress.jpg)

And at the end of August we went to Borrby for a Hüttner family holiday. We had a nice house with a hot tub and only 5 min walk to the endless sand beach. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Borrby%2002.jpg)

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Borrby.jpg)

Laika and Luna met again for the first time after separation (and hated each other initially), we took a trip to Stenshuvud Nationalpark and to Kivik for äppelmust, and Angie and Chris got married in Ystad. I also went swimming a few times!

### September
The week after Borrby, Mama, Papa and Luna stayed in Helsingborg in a hostel down the road from our house, and we had some more nice walks and trips. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Pusshållplats.jpg)

And I got Mama's old Overlock machine (they had come here by car)! Their trip back home took another week, since they avoided motorways completely. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Overlocker.jpg)

Queen Elizabeth II died on 8th September.

Duncan and had a little trip to Lund: we walked around, had African food from a food truck, bought nice nail polishes and Duncan bought fingerless gloves from a fishing supply shop.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Duncan.jpg)

I bought new glasses with a clear frame.

Bought an exercise bike on Blocket for 750 SEK, and got it delivered by the seller for an extra 50 SEK. We decided to cycle from Helsingborg to Haparanda. 

At the end of September I took the night train from Hamburg to Vienna. I had 4 hours in Hamburg and walked around the city a bit - got a good impression, in contrast to the first few times I had to change trains here. The trip was mostly to attend the 20-year anniversary of my university year: we were about 30 people and visited the Muthgasse premises and then walked up Kahlenberg to a nice Heurigen. Most people hadn't really changed much - don't know if that's good or bad. Otherwise, I spent the time mostly with Angie: we went to the new vegan Billa Pflanzilla supermarket (vegan Bananenschnitten and vegan Leberkäse!!), spent a lot of time in Komolka looking at fabrics, had dinner with Tante Irmi & Onkel Bertram, and met Stefan, Stephanstefan and others in a pub.

After a few days in Vienna I spent some time in Zipf, which was really nice. The weather was very summery and we visited some place in the area that I had never properly visited, like Ampflwang and Gmunden. I also remember spending a lot of time in the dairy section in various supermarkets to check out the varieties and ingredients of plant-based and dairy yogurt products because of the oat gurt project I had become involved with at Oatly.

### October 
A few days after I came back from Austria, Duncan went by train for a week to Netherlands and Luxemburg for a Loud Numbers workshop and a data sonification conference. 

I got several kilos of garden apples from my colleague Kerstin which I turned into Apfelmus. 

I had a health check from work and got pretty good marks for blood sugar, blood fat, blood pressure and lung capacity. They didn't check much else. 
I also got my 4th covid vaccination. No one in Sweden officially recommended it to under-65-year-olds, but it was also no problem to book a slot and show up to get the vaccination. 

One Saturday we went to Mölle for pizza. It was good, but cold.

### November
Buffy stayed with us for 10 days while Isak and Callo went to Turkey. She and Laika got along fine, they're just not exactly best friends. And I will never get used to the weird way that Buffy pees: just standing on her front legs.

We had a Zoom call with Pawel who had just moved back to GBG after a (miserable) year in Trondheim. And we got a new internet provider, which finally meant the end of random internet dropouts which had been especially annoying during online meetings. 

One Saturday we went to a concert in Malmö. The trains got stopped at Kävlinge and nothing continued for about 1.5 h. We cancelled our nice pizza restaurant reservation in Malmö and went to a sushi place in Kävlinge, until we could see the trains run again. Then continued on and made it in time for the concert. I had not realised how much I had missed going out and being among people in a dark, slightly shabby nightclub that smells of beer. It was great! The concert was great too - William Basinski, and pre-show was Elin Piel, both delivering very atmospheric synth music.

I made my first pair of real trousers with a complicated fly zipper and fancy welt backpockets.

I put up the Christmas decoration early, since it was so dark and grey outside.

We got a new electric toothbrush (Sonicare!). brrrrr.


### December

At the very beginning of December, Duncan stayed in a "cabin in the woods" in Tjörnarp as a music retreat. Laika stayed with him, and I joined for the last two days. We had pizza at the only food place in town, which was only open once a week. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Nov%20-%20Tjörnarp.jpg)

It was a bit wet and dark, so times for walks were limited. But we found many interesting mushrooms, hear many nice bird calls and even saw hair ice one morning! 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20hair%20ice.jpg)

Duncan and I  joined the communications sub-group of Klimatavtal and had Lucia fika at our new friend Anna's place to talk social media strategy (and get to know each other). 

A card arrived that had been finding its way for more than 6 years! It had been sent in April 2015 by Mama and Papa. Someone from the Swedish postal service had corrected the address and it finally arrived, looking like a relic from hundred years ago. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20card.jpg)

Then I got a big cold and stayed home for a few days, but always tested covid negative (even though my gurt squad colleague Kerstin had tested positive a few days earlier). Luckily, by the time I was supposed to go to Austria I was feeling fine again. Unluckily though, Mama and Papa tested positive, so I couldn't actually see them for this pre-Christmas visit. So it was "only" Angie, Chris and friends. We celebrated her 40th birthday partly at the Glühweinstandl and partly in a pub. While I was in Austria, it was snowy and -8C in Helsingborg, which I mostly missed unfortunately. Being on a plane again felt weird, but I do love the view of the clouds.

Angie and I went to Josef Brot about 3 times, and ate Brot und Aufstriche for 90% of meals during the four days I was there. 

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20Brot.jpg)

On the weekend before Christmas we watched Home Alone and ate lots of Christmas-y snacks from the British Shop that Ros had sent us. Christmas was pretty similar to last year: we had Austrian style dinner on the 24th, and then Tempeh Wellington on the 25th. This year, the holidays were placed pretty badly with 25th and 1st both being Sundays. But I took the whole mellandagarna off work to really enjoy all the boring things: reading, walking, cooking, sewing, coding, playing squash, etc. 

Laika had a bad stomach just before Christmas, so Duncan and I had to get up every few hours to take her out. Then during the mellandagarna she got increasingly reluctant to go outside, because of early fireworks. Poor girl.

At the very end of the year, Duncan's new office chair was delivered. New Year's Eve was rainy and 10c. We watched Top Gun, played Spirit Island, ate pizza and cake, planned holidays for the year and were asleep by 00:30.

![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20chair.jpg)

Plans for next year include 2 big walks (one in spring, one in autumn), a big 3-week summer holiday train travel through Europe (with Laika) and two retreats for Duncan (one in spring, one in late autumn). I would also like to go by train through Sweden a bit more (maybe Inlandsbana?), swim in lakes and the sea, go to Malmö some more and stay happy.

### Misc wisdoms of 2022
- We got really into prepping lunchboxes. Most Sunday's I make 6 somewhat healthy bowls to have for lunches [Lunchboxes and Bowls](projects/cooking/Lunchboxes%20and%20Bowls.md). Having prepped lunchboxes is GREAT.
- We had Laoganma tofu (with fermented vegetables) and [Yeung Man's Garlic Chili Noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG8KpOvN5V8&t=366s) each about once a week. 
- Many evenings we watched restoration videos in bed. 
- Due to being in the "gurt squad", I have tasted SO MUCH (mostly plant-based) yogurt this year. 
- Visiting Flåm out of season (at the beginning of April) was amazing. We had the whole Flåmbana to ourselves and the village that is usually flooded by cruise tourists in summer was sleepy and deserted. The weather wasn't too bad either: nice snow in Myrdal and low-hanging clouds in the fjords down at sea level. Bergen was even sunny!
- I continued to make a lot of fermentations and sew and repair many things. I made my first pair of proper trousers [Attitude trousers](projects/sewing/Attitude%20trousers.md), a self-drafted summer dress, a self-drafted summer skirt, and I designed a fabric to make a blouse for Angie's 40th birthday (which unfortunately didn't arrive in time). I also learned how to use the Overlocker. 
- I learned some new coding skills, mainly during my project of Gothenburg's street maps. I also learned how to use Github pages to set up a website, and started a [Digital Garden](https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden/) (via Quartz) that is also hosted on Github pages. And I worked through about 20 days of the 100 Days of Python course. 
- Malmö and Copenhagen are both really cool places, once you get away from the shopping streets and the more touristy places. 
- I read several books in Swedish this year, listened to a lot of Språket and P3 Dokumentär podcasts, joined the Matkooperativet community group meetings which were in Swedish, and survived the Oatly Technolgy Development Christmas get-together in Swedish. Still not 100% comfortably fluent, but getting there. 
- Fermentation wisdom of this year: Fermenting Brussels sprouts is delicious! So are celeric and carrot. When making chili ferments, wear gloves.

- Didn't quite manage to go winter swimming this year. But I did go swimming in the sea several times this year, including in the harbour at Pixlapiren. And it does get easier when going in. And it does feel amazing!
- It's much better to stay at solid, simple hostels than supposedly fancy hotels that then disappoint.
- Gimbap are a great hiking and picnic food: make a whole roll, cut into pieces without taking the roll apart and wrap tightly into aluminium foil or clingfilm. Super un-messy transportation and delicious when at room temperature.
