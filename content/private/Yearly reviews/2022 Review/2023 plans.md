## Science
- Keep up to date with scientific discoveries: Make time (2h/week) to read Science and Nature --> book **Sunday afternoons** into the calendar.
- Fermentation & biotechnology: 
	- Plan it into the workweek to read papers and books, increase knowledge in these areas --> book **Friday afternoons** into the calendar. 
	- Continue to experiment at home with fermentations.
	- Pursue the fermentation visualization/database project (with Max).


## Media & art
- Read more solarpunk-related literature.
- Go through inspiration folder and pinterest every once in a while.
- Take the camera and take photos. Post them on Instagram.


## Coding
- Pick up generative art again (e.g. try to recreate some works from my inspiration pinterest). 
- Make the digital garden nice (but don't make that the most important thing about it!).
- Use Python or JS for some concrete projects. 


## Food & health
- Drink more water and herbal tea. 
- Keep up the meal planning and lunchbox prep.
- Serve smaller portions and don't over eat.
- Limit snacking to right after meals. 
- Aim for 3x 20 min on exercise bike per week.


## Community
- Contribute to Klimatavtal.
- Join some nice Discord communities (Craig Mod? Future Ecologies?) and be somewhat active in them.
