- [ ] Schönere Darstellung meiner Fermentationsprojekte, und andere Projekte die "fertig" sind. Nicht unbedingt den ganzen Prozess zeigen (oder zumindest nicht vorrangig), sondern lieber ganz clean das fertige Produkt, schön fotografiert, präsentieren. Z.B. Tempeh, Miso, fermentiertes Gemüse, aber nicht _alles_, sondern ausgewählte. Das selbe mit Fotos, Kleidungsstücken (_schön_ fotografieren), digitalen Projekten.

## Learn & collect
- [ ] Fungi Datenbank wieder anfangen bzw. erweitern und aktiv daran arbeiten. 
- [ ] **Continue with Fungi Newsletter!!** Investigate and write down. Reactivate newsletter for just a month (focus month)?
- [ ] Understand **cheese** and the proteins that make it --> take notes in Obsidian. Maybe make a categorisation of the different components that make (dairy) cheese stretchy https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-cheeses-such-as-mozzarella-and-cheddar-melt-differently-than-ricotta/
- [ ] **Bioinformatics** investigation about plant proteins, what makes casein make cheese structures, can that be found/generated in plants, Alpha Fold, enzyme engineering, protein engineering, targeted proteases. Maybe do this in work time, convince boss that it's a good idea to spend some time working on that.
- [ ] Mastering some **recipes**. Sourdough, plant-based custard bun, What's the Deli sandwich. Get good at sourdough, understand how it works. How do the different flours influence the bread? Maybe this one is close to What's the Deli sandwich bread? [Vollkorn Mischbrot (Weizen + Roggen) in Kastenform](projects/fermentation/Sourdough%20recipes.md#Vollkorn%20Mischbrot%20(Weizen%20+%20Roggen)%20in%20Kastenform)
- [ ] **VCV rack**. Learn it in a systematic way, document for other learners. Make some patches, save them. How can I feed guitar into it? How can I feed samples into it? How can I feed scientific data into it? Can I use e.g. genome sequencing information to generate voltages for VCV rack?
- [ ] **Photography**. Post one photo a day. Challenge yourself with new techniques. Watch good photographers on Youtube. Go through own photo collection and select my favourites (put on website?). Look at other people's work - what do I like, what do I gravitate towards, what am I less interested in? Why do I like some photos in particular? What can I learn about some of the photos, what's the background story that makes the photo more interesting?
- [ ] Learning about **trees**. Go through the tree book. Visit the trees. Take photos. Notice differences. Read up on details about each tree.
- [ ] **Degrowth**. What does it mean? What is it? What organisations exist and what are they doing? How can it be integrated into different practices? What are good examples (in the city)? Book recommendations. 
- [ ] **Personal development**/soft skills. How to communicate better. How to make friends. How to be chill. Read some books. Volunteering. Self-help books. Read with critical mind, but take away learnings from it. How to implement these things in practice? Maybe good one for winter?
- [ ] **Sewing** skills. Learn some specific ones. Perfect some things. French seams, working with hardware or tricky fabrics, lining clothes, zippers. Make a project that seems daunting, e.g. a bag. 
- [ ] **Block printing/lino cut**. Learn how to do it well. Actually print some stuff - on fabric, on cards. Get inspired by things around you. Look through Pinterest and other websites. Improve own clothes. Make nice tea towels. Print on T-shirts. 
- [ ] **Fabric print design**. Design on fabrics and make things out of them. Maps, scientific data, fungal growth patterns, etc. Something with a story behind it. Figure out what clothes pattern I like to make and wear and focus on that - make it in different fabrics and colours to combine in various ways. 
- [ ] **Field recordings** of places i go to (like Japan travel) and use in music pieces. Make a signature music piece for each city. Noises from the street, snippets of conversations, announcements, jingles, animals, weather, environment, steps on ground, materials, eating, etc. Complement with photos. 
- [ ] Build a **Moss battery** https://www.instructables.com/Indoor-Moss-Microbial-Fuel-Cell/

## General thoughts
- [ ] Professional development: _2024-11-09_ 
	- I don't want to use my energy at work or fill my free time with making presentations prettier or worry about lab organisation. I would much rather work on some scientific problems.
	- Much nutritional focus lately, and it's nice to learn new things, but it's not my main interest. 
- [ ] **Focus months**!  Deeper focus on developing skills or furthering skills. Document on Instagram? Include reading books about the specific topic and recommending a few. _2024-11-09_
