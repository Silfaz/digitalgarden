### Audience
Be in contact with on a regular basis
1. General public in Helsingborg
2. Members of HKA
3. Active members of HKA


Different means of communication, different language, different topics

Internal, overview 

### Language
What languages should we post in? (--> will be part of style guide?)
Backgrounds of people in Helsingborg: Indian, Moroccan, Egyptian, Syrian, Ukrainians

#### Team of translators :
Swedish, English, (standard) Arabic, Russian

--> call on them for longer and more "official" communication, e.g. 

### Our presence online
Our plan: Do less stuff well rather than a lot of stuff badly.


Instagram: 432 followers
Newsletter to all members
Linkedin: useful esp. for coporate collaborations (be tagged in their posts), official organisations
Facebook group


### Comms teams projects
- Newsletter (regular) going to all signees: sketch out a rough structure
- Social media activities, ongoing --> analysis, proposal **Luciane**
- Revamping websites: look at things that are not ideal, how to improve the text **everyone**
- Visual styleguide: colours, fonts, logo, language  **Duncan**
- Define transport focus --> needs more guidance from board to define that better. Align with municipality so that we can amplify rather than duplicate. 




#### Next steps
- Communicate our meeting notes to the active members (start with Messenger, then later maybe a dedicated mailing) **Silfa**
- Set up a content calendar, including important local and global dates (e.g. international sustainable somthing something day) **Anna** 
- Set up an image bank (or is there an existing one?)
- Reach out to students (communications, sustainability), middle of February, who wants to help us with our social media presence --> go to lecturers, speak to communications/sustainability students to present HKA
- Reach out to HKA members if we have the skills for e.g. webdesign


### Meetings & communications in the comms team
- 17:00-18:30, first Monday of the month
- Whatsapp group --> **Silfa** will set up
