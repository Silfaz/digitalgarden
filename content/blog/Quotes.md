> It always seems impossible until it's done. - _Nelson Mandela_ 


> Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. - _Epictetus_


>It's incorrect to say we eat food because we need the energy it contains. The conservation of energy means that it is neither created nor destroyed; we are radiating energy constantly, at pretty much the same rate that we absorb it. The difference is that the heat energy we radiate is a high-entropy form of energy, meaning it's disordered. The chemical energy we absorb is a low-entropy form of energy, meaning it's ordered. In effect, we are consuming order and generating disorder; we live by increasing the disorder of the universe. It's only because the universe started in a highly ordered state that we are able to exist at all. - _From Roger Penroses's book The Emporer's New Mind (via Ted Chiang's Exhalation). [Exhalation](projects/books/Exhalation.md)_


> The ultimate form of preparation is not planning for a specific scenario, but a mindset that can handle uncertainty. - _James Clear_ (via Dense Discovery newsletter)

> Sometimes you don’t know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory. - _Gunnar Freyr (via Dense Discovery newsletter)_


> When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression. - _Clay Shirky (via Dense Discovery newsleetter)


> No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. - _Heraclitus_

> You'll worry less about what people think of you when you realise how seldom they do. - _David Foster Wallace_

>If you aren't feeling like an imposter, then you're likely stuck in your comfort zone. - _Random guy in YouTube comments (regarding Imposter syndrome)_
