- We visited [Dalby S√∂derskog](trips/Dalby%20S√∂derskog.md) on a half-rainy Saturday. It's Europe's smallest National Park, and it is indeed tiny. But still interesting to walk through, and especially to observe and discover all the things that grow and thrieve on and around dead wood. 
- [Crown shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness): 
 > Crown shyness is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavrious, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

- The discovery of vast - and somewhat renewable - **hydrogen reservoirs** ([article in Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)) all over the world might mean a possible greener future, sooner than with electric conversion alone. This sounds very exciting! I'm already dreaming of travelling without a bad conscience in planes that sprinkle water droplets out of their engines.
- I've been reading (and really enjoying) **[The Mountain in the Sea](projects/books/The%20Mountain%20in%20the%20Sea.md)** lately, and **connectomes** and brain mappings are a central part of the plot. Interesting (and somewhat scary?) that the real world is catching up: The brain of a 6 hour old Drosphila fly has been mapped and a connectome created ([article in Nature](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)). The researchers found some resemblance with how neural networks work: 
> _"The team also found that 41% of the brain neurons form ‚Äòrecurrent loops‚Äô, providing feedback to their upstream partners. These shortcuts and loops resemble state-of-the-art artificial neural networks that are being used in artificial-intelligence research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting that the computer-science field is converging onto what evolution has discovered,‚Äù says Cardona.". _



## w9 2023
- I've been reading a LOT about [Lactic acid bacteria](projects/science/Lactic%20acid%20bacteria.md) lately. Partly to reactivate a little dataviz project that I'm working on, partly because I also need it for work, and partly because I am of course interested in all things fermentation. The Lactobacillus genus recently went through a reorganization of the taxonomy, and there's a great [video/seminar](https://youtu.be/ErQbie690po) (by The Fermentation Association) with one of the authors about why it was done and what the new genera are. 
- For a while, **One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez has been on my to-read list. So I got the audiobook (in German) and started, but after about 6 hours of listening I have to say that it's just not for me (and I decided to skip the remaining 12 hours). It's a nice evocative language and I do like the [magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism) style. But every other person is called Jos√© or Arcadio Buendia (which just makes everything unnecessarily tedious to follow), and the story just trickles along without any build-up to anything, and there's some yucky marrying children stuff going on, and in general I just got incredibly bored by the whole thing. Not how I want to spend my time, when there's so many other great books to read. The historical background of South America in the 19th and early 20th century would have been interesting, but it was impossible to know what was actual and what was fictional. 
- One book that I did enjoy a lot was **A Psalm for the Wild-Built** (great title!). I saw it being described as "cosy core", and I like that. It's futuristic, utopian, solar punk, but very gentle and connected to nature. The main character is a tea monk, travelling around to find a purpose, and meeting a robot on the way. Best to read with a steaming cup of tea on the side. üçµ

## w7 2023
- Started watching **The Last of Us** about escaping the zombie pandemic caused by a filamentous fungi (the creepy [Cordyceps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps?useskin=vector) that replaces host tissue with mycelium). I really enjoy it, especially the video-gamey scenes, like when one of the protagonists snipes at hordes of zombies from a high-rise so that his friends can reach a safe zone.
- We finally decided on where to walk for this year's Easter Hike (this is becoming a tradition after [[Gotaleden]] in 2021 and [Kullaleden](trips/Kullaleden.md) in 2022). It's going to be part of [Sk√•neleden](trips/Sk√•neleden.md), the Northern half of the North-to-South route, 133 km from Vittsj√∂ to H√∂rby.
- I finished my [Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md)!! They look great and it was a very satisfying project, as the pattern is very precise and has some nice sharp corners, and the Youtube tutorial is top notch. I'm already living in these trousers. üëñ The only annoying thing was - as usual - the buttonhole. It's just _impossible_ to get anything bulkier than 2 layers under the buttonhole presserfoot. In the end I did the buttonhole "manually" by sewing two narrow rows of zig-zag stitching and connected them with a wider stitch.

- **Mycoremediation** - cleaning the environment with fungi - seems very appealing. And a lot of people are hoping that fungi can be found that can "eat up" plastic on land and in the ocean. Prompted by the question in the Future Ecologies Discord channel if there are any large-scale projects going on in that area, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole: [Bioremediation with fungi](fungi/Bioremediation%20with%20fungi.md). In short, there are loads of studies that show that some fungal strain can degrade a particular, isolated plastic in a specific form (often soluble), at a specific concentration under specific conditions (often with the pH and temperature adjusted and necessary trace elements added). The problem with a real life application is that plastics are very resistant to chemical (and therefore also enzymatic) attack, usually come mixed together with other polymers, are found in difficult environments (ocean, landfills) with or without oxygen, etc. Preparing the substrate in a way that the fungi will just gobble it up, is tricky and costly. Another (in most papers unanswered) question is if the breakdown products are actually less harmful in the environment than the plastic polymer. Will fungal degradation release e.g. plasticizers that then leak into waterways? Will the fungi themselves become toxic? (There is this idea that oyster mushroom could grow on trash and then be eaten - is that healthy?) Fungi also release CO2 and throught he plastic degradation also potentially methane and other substances - is that better or worse for the environment than leaving the carbon more sequestered as a polymer?
- On the weekend we went with Laika to a **dog bakery** in Gothenburg. It was ridiculous and wonderful. I had red velvet cake for the first time and was a bit disappointed. It looks more impressive than it tastes. Or maybe a dog bakery is not the best place to evaluate cakes for humans?

## w4 2023
- Really enjoying the [Scales of Change](https://www.futureecologies.net/dragons) series of the [Future Ecologies](https://www.futureecologies.net/#home-section) podcast. Signed up for their Patreon, since it includes a Discord membership that seems pretty nice. 
- A job fair for plant-centric food producers https://terra.do/climate-jobs/climate-job-fair/terra-do-plant-futures-initiative-job-fair-2023-02-17/
- I attended my first hackathon this week! (I know, so 2011...) It was organised by [Foo Caf√©](https://foocafe.org/) in Malm√∂ and was about protein folding and the new algorithms that have popped up and become publicly available over the last two years: [AlphaFold](projects/coding/AlphaFold.md), [ESMfold](https://esmatlas.com/), Rosettafold, etc. The workshop leader was Amijai Saragovi, a Postdoc in the Baker lab in Seattle. (Here are the [seminar notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12SgqOSQw7aRS5qEVr360O8BdChmJv0Ng)) I've been meaning to look into this stuff a bit more for a while anyway, so it was a good opportunity to be "forced" to do that. We were a nice little crowd of about 10 people, working from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, with some of us (including me) going home to sleep, and some actually doing the whole 24h. My team tried to improve the sweetness of the protein brazzein by using a combination of MPNN, Alphafold, EMSfold, Inpainting and Pymol. 

## w3 2023
- Tried to make vegan [tamagoyaki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/) with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn't find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of [uttapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam)). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but [this one here](https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/)uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn't turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I've only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian). 
- Finally managed to get all my self-made clothes from the last 3 (?) years out on the bed, try them on and take pictures of myself. Started to catalogue them [here](projects/sewing/Made%20from%20scratch.md). 
- A good way to scope out which hiking routes offer sufficient accomodation and food opportunities along the way is to download the .gpx file of a route (often from alltrails, e.g. https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/orebro--2/bergslagsleden), then going to https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ and importing that file. Then in different layers and with different colours, things can be added. I made two separate maps so far, one for Bergslagsleden and one for √Öhus-Karlskrona, with all the restaurants, supermarkets and hostels along the way in different colours.

- Made vegan [hottokeiki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/vegan-fluffy-japanese-pancakes/), tasted very good! 
- For nice ambient music, Duncan's [Jamuary](https://duncangeere.bandcamp.com/album/jamuary-2023) on Bandcamp is a good listen. 
- Apparently, De Cecco is a much better pasta brand than Barilla (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XMTvAgpEw). I will test and report back. I do love Barilla's tagliatelle, but maybe there is better stuff out there?

- Made [Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)](projects/fermentation/Keckek%20el%20Fouqara%20(Poor%20man's%20cheese).md), fermented bulgur that apparantly will taste (at some point) like cheese. We'll see in a few weeks...
- Oliver Burkman's masterclass (2x2h) on **Imperfectionism**. Some nuggets:
	- Pay yourself first. I.e. dedicate the first 10/60/... min of your day to something you think is important and you want to do. _Then_ go to the necessary tasks like answering emails, etc.
	- You don't have to "clear the decks" to be able to move to the fun or important or more interesting stuff. To do lists are neverending.
	- Accepting your unipresence (i.e. you can only ever be in one place at a time).

- Fermenting Data https://fermentingdata.net/. Interesting project from a researcher from Aarhus University about "engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation".
- TO READ: An in-depth and interactive explanation of GPS https://ciechanow.ski/gps/
- How Mesopotamian beer was brewed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK4DMt8ARyU&t=873s -> Contains great excerpts from old Sumerian poems and stories about making beer, drinking beer and getting drunk. E.g. the story about the god [Enki](https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/) and his daughter Inanna who have a drinking contest and then she convinces him to give her all of his powers. "According to the Babylonian _Enuma Elish_ (c. 1100 BCE), Enki was the oldest son of the first gods, Apsu and [Tiamat](https://www.worldhistory.org/Tiamat/). 

> _In the beginning of time, the world was undifferentiated swirling chaos from which separated Apsu, the male principle personified by fresh water and Tiamat, the female principle defined by salt water."_ https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/ 


- It's fascinating that ancient civilizations had a quite modern-seeming idea of the origins of the universe - an undifferentiated, swirling chaos. 
- Looked into nice hiking routes in Southern Sweden for the Easter holidays: [Blekingeleden](https://www.blekingeleden.com/), [Bergaslagsleden](https://www.bergslagsleden.se/) or [√Öhus-Karlskrona](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/sweden/skane/ahus-karlskrona) seem good so far.

- Protein structure prediction with AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5 It makes my head spin to think about what could be done with either accurately predicting structures from amino acid sequences, or even better to **design a function and then get the necessary aa sequence to express in a host**. THAT'S INSANE!! There's also now a thing called **"hallucinating protein sequences"**, which sounds like straight out of a sci-fi novel. There, random aa sequences are fed in, and the AI generates optimize the sequences until the structures resemble something that the neural network recognizes as a protein. üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§Øüôå  

> _His team is now using this approach to design proteins that do useful things, such as catalyse a particular chemical reaction, by specifying the amino acids responsible for the desired function and letting the AI dream up the rest._ [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5)
