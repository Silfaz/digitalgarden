- Tried to make vegan [tamagoyaki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/) with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn't find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of [uttapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam)). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but [this one here](https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/)uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn't turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I've only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian).

- Made [Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)](projects/fermentation/Keckek%20el%20Fouqara%20(Poor%20man's%20cheese).md), fermented bulgur that apparantly will taste (at some point) like cheese. We'll see in a few weeks...
- Oliver Burkman's masterclass (2x2h) on **Imperfectionism**. Some nuggets:
	- Pay yourself first. I.e. dedicate the first 10/60/... min of your day to something you think is important and you want to do. _Then_ go to the necessary tasks like answering emails, etc.
	- You don't have to "clear the decks" to be able to move to the fun or important or more interesting stuff. To do lists are neverending.
	- Accepting your unipresence (i.e. you can only ever be in one place at a time).

## w1 2023
- Fermenting Data https://fermentingdata.net/. Interesting project from a researcher from Aarhus University about "engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation".
- TO READ: An in-depth and interactive explanation of GPS https://ciechanow.ski/gps/
- How Mesopotamian beer was brewed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK4DMt8ARyU&t=873s -> Contains great excerpts from old Sumerian poems and stories about making beer, drinking beer and getting drunk. E.g. the story about the god [Enki](https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/) and his daughter Inanna who have a drinking contest and then she convinces him to give her all of his powers. "According to the Babylonian _Enuma Elish_ (c. 1100 BCE), Enki was the oldest son of the first gods, Apsu and [Tiamat](https://www.worldhistory.org/Tiamat/). 

> _In the beginning of time, the world was undifferentiated swirling chaos from which separated Apsu, the male principle personified by fresh water and Tiamat, the female principle defined by salt water."_ https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/ 


- It's fascinating that ancient civilizations had a quite modern-seeming idea of the origins of the universe - an undifferentiated, swirling chaos. 
- Looked into nice hiking routes in Southern Sweden for the Easter holidays: [Blekingeleden](https://www.blekingeleden.com/), [Bergaslagsleden](https://www.bergslagsleden.se/) or [Åhus-Karlskrona](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/sweden/skane/ahus-karlskrona) seem good so far.

- Protein structure prediction with AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5 It makes my head spin to think about what could be done with either accurately predicting structures from amino acid sequences, or even better to **design a function and then get the necessary aa sequence to express in a host**. THAT'S INSANE!! There's also now a thing called **"hallucinating protein sequences"**, which sounds like straight out of a sci-fi novel. There, random aa sequences are fed in, and the AI generates optimize the sequences until the structures resemble something that the neural network recognizes as a protein. 😵‍💫🤯🙌  

> _His team is now using this approach to design proteins that do useful things, such as catalyse a particular chemical reaction, by specifying the amino acids responsible for the desired function and letting the AI dream up the rest._ [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5)
