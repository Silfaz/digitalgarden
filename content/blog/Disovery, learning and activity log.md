## w1 2023
- Fermenting Data https://fermentingdata.net/. Interesting project from a researcher from Aarhus University about "engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation".
- TO READ: An in-depth and interactive explanation of GPS https://ciechanow.ski/gps/
- How Mesopotamian beer was brewed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK4DMt8ARyU&t=873s -> Contains great excerpts from old Sumerian poems and stories about making beer, drinking beer and getting drunk. E.g. the story about the god [Enki](https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/) and his daughter Inanna who have a drinking contest and then she convinces him to give her all of his powers. "According to the Babylonian _Enuma Elish_ (c. 1100 BCE), Enki was the oldest son of the first gods, Apsu and [Tiamat](https://www.worldhistory.org/Tiamat/). 
> _In the beginning of time, the world was undifferentiated swirling chaos from which separated Apsu, the male principle personified by fresh water and Tiamat, the female principle defined by salt water."_ https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/ 
- It's fascinating that ancient civilizations had a quite modern-seeming idea of the origins of the universe - an undifferentiated, swirling chaos. 
- Looked into nice hiking routes in Southern Sweden for the Easter holidays: [Blekingeleden](https://www.blekingeleden.com/), [Bergaslagsleden](https://www.bergslagsleden.se/) or [Ã…hus-Karlskrona](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/sweden/skane/ahus-karlskrona) seem good so far.
