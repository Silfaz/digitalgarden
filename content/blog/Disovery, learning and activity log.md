- The Netherlands produces an astonishing amount of food, both vegetables and meat. Here's an article that portrays the scale of it, and describes how it runs actually very energy- and resource-efficiently (or as good as possible): https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/netherlands-agriculture-technology/

- This week I refreshed my Phython pandas knowledge to analyse and plot some fermentation data. From work I have a lot of recordings of fermentation pH and temperature values over time, and most of them are in huge Excel sheets and it's a pain to analyse by hand. But I'm always in this dilemma that my datasets are still small enough to be able to do it by hand, and it's usually faster than sitting down and trying to figure out how to program a pipeline for analysis, that would make things quicker in the long run. Anyway, I finally had some time and watched a few Youtube videos about pandas, and followed some tutorials about [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/. And - tataaa - I have now sucessfully created a Jupyter notebook with a pipeline that cleanes up my data, calculates some essential things, and then creates a nice graph. It still needs some improvements, like some loops over iterative file names, but in general I'm pretty happy that I managed to produce something useful.

- I finished reading the **thick** novel Jade City. It was recommended somewhere, and I saw it in the library a few weeks ago and just took it. I expected more fantasy elements; it's essentially a family and clan saga about mafia structures in a tropical, Shanghai-y/Hongkong-y island nation. Yes, they get certain powers by being in contact with jade, but that's basically all that is different from the real world. If you substitute *jade* with *drugs* it would just be a gangster/mafia stroy. There's lots of underground trading logistics, street fighting, fulfilling family traditions, rivalry, etc. I did enjoy reading it, because the characters and the story were described in a very vivid way, but I won't read the rest of the trilogy. Too much other stuff to read. 
- While reading Jade City, I got a bit annoyed - as I do ocassionally with other stories about "alternative realities" - that the power structures in the fictional nation were quite similar to existing power structures in the real world. Like, why don't authors paint more diverse visions of fictional societies, but instead always fall back to the common "men are in power, women are not as well regarded, foreigners are suspicious" bla bla bla. It's so tiring. Same in Jade City, where one of the few main female characters is an incredibly talented jade fighter, but there is constantly this undercurrent of her not being taken seriously, having to convince people much more than her brothers, not being considered for certain roles because she's a woman, etc. However, at the end of the book there was actually an interview with the author, explaining that this setting was deliberate to make it seem more realistic and relatable, instead of creating a _complete_ fantasy-world. I can understand that, though I would generally really appreciate more escapism in novels and descriptions of worlds that are a bit more diverse - in whatever way - than our current one. Isn't the whole point of making up fictional worlds that you can think up different ways of how things are run?

- This Easter weekend, we walked a half of Skåneleden North to South: [SL2 Nord till syd](trips/SL2%20Nord%20till%20syd.md). It was not only a nice walk, but I also learned a lot about the history of Skåne and the areas we walked through, observed trees, birds and insects, visited the geographical centre of Skåne and the location of Sweden's oldest settlement, and got to know several new mid-sized towns (Hässleholm, Höör, Hörby).

## w12 2023
- Finished watching **The Last of Us**. I thought it was excellently made. The way it keeps you on your toes, without being _too_ graphic or scary most of the time. And the way it has calm epidoses in between the faster ones. It was actually much more slow-paced than I had expected, but that makes the fast scenes even more exciting and important. Something I have problems with in newer Star Trek series, like Discovery: there's no time to take a breath, every single incident is threatening the whole of the universe, etc. You just get tired of the high stakes and everything becomes a bit meaningless. Thankfully, they manage to get to a better balance (and better storytelling) again in the newest (third) **Picard** season - it's really good! I'm halfway through the season.
- Also started watching the BBC show **Race Across the World**. I LOVED season 1. During the midst of the pandemic in 2020, I was really craving pictures and impressions from other countries and cultures, and it was so nice to follow 5 teams as they make their way over land (and sea) from London, via Greece and Central Asia, to China, Vietnam and finally Singapore. It was varied, both in terms of transport, nature and culture. Season 2 was North to South from Mexico City to Ushuaia, and it was also good but a looot of bus travel, since that's the only mode of public transport available in a lot of places in Central and South America. So we'll see how season 3 plays out now, where the teams travel from Vancouver to St. John's on Newfoundland, via Yukon and Northern Manitoba. So far, car sharing seems to be *the* way to go in Canda, at least in the part where they're starting from. The nature is amazing, of course. It somewhat scratches my travel itch, but it also makes me long to go to all of these places. 
- Inspired by Race Across the World, I read about **Haida Gwaii** and found several interesting documentaries I want to watch: [Haida Gwaii: On the Edge of the World](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/haidagwaii), [Hadwin's Judgement](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/hadwinsjudgement) and [Canda Over the Edge: Haida Gwaii South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBNlrk59bZ8). 


## w11 2023
- We visited [Dalby Söderskog](trips/Dalby%20Söderskog.md) on a half-rainy Saturday. It's Europe's smallest National Park, and it is indeed tiny. But still interesting to walk through, and especially to observe and discover all the things that grow and thrieve on and around dead wood. 
- [Crown shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness): 
 > Crown shyness is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavrious, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

## w10 2023
- The discovery of vast - and somewhat renewable - **hydrogen reservoirs** ([article in Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)) all over the world might mean a possible greener future, sooner than with electric conversion alone. This sounds very exciting! I'm already dreaming of travelling without a bad conscience in planes that sprinkle water droplets out of their engines.
- I've been reading (and really enjoying) **[The Mountain in the Sea](projects/books/The%20Mountain%20in%20the%20Sea.md)** lately, and **connectomes** and brain mappings are a central part of the plot. Interesting (and somewhat scary?) that the real world is catching up: The brain of a 6 hour old Drosphila fly has been mapped and a connectome created ([article in Nature](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)). The researchers found some resemblance with how neural networks work: 
> _"The team also found that 41% of the brain neurons form ‘recurrent loops’, providing feedback to their upstream partners. These shortcuts and loops resemble state-of-the-art artificial neural networks that are being used in artificial-intelligence research. “It’s interesting that the computer-science field is converging onto what evolution has discovered,” says Cardona.". _



## w9 2023
- I've been reading a LOT about [Lactic acid bacteria](projects/science/Lactic%20acid%20bacteria.md) lately. Partly to reactivate a little dataviz project that I'm working on, partly because I also need it for work, and partly because I am of course interested in all things fermentation. The Lactobacillus genus recently went through a reorganization of the taxonomy, and there's a great [video/seminar](https://youtu.be/ErQbie690po) (by The Fermentation Association) with one of the authors about why it was done and what the new genera are. 
- For a while, **One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel García Márquez has been on my to-read list. So I got the audiobook (in German) and started, but after about 6 hours of listening I have to say that it's just not for me (and I decided to skip the remaining 12 hours). It's a nice evocative language and I do like the [magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism) style. But every other person is called José or Arcadio Buendia (which just makes everything unnecessarily tedious to follow), and the story just trickles along without any build-up to anything, and there's some yucky marrying children stuff going on, and in general I just got incredibly bored by the whole thing. Not how I want to spend my time, when there's so many other great books to read. The historical background of South America in the 19th and early 20th century would have been interesting, but it was impossible to know what was actual and what was fictional. 
- One book that I did enjoy a lot was **A Psalm for the Wild-Built** (great title!). I saw it being described as "cosy core", and I like that. It's futuristic, utopian, solar punk, but very gentle and connected to nature. The main character is a tea monk, travelling around to find a purpose, and meeting a robot on the way. Best to read with a steaming cup of tea on the side. 🍵

## w7 2023
- Started watching **The Last of Us** about escaping the zombie pandemic caused by a filamentous fungi (the creepy [Cordyceps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps?useskin=vector) that replaces host tissue with mycelium). I really enjoy it, especially the video-gamey scenes, like when one of the protagonists snipes at hordes of zombies from a high-rise so that his friends can reach a safe zone.
- We finally decided on where to walk for this year's Easter Hike (this is becoming a tradition after [[Gotaleden]] in 2021 and [Kullaleden](trips/Kullaleden.md) in 2022). It's going to be part of [Skåneleden](trips/Skåneleden.md), the Northern half of the North-to-South route, 133 km from Vittsjö to Hörby.
- I finished my [Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md)!! They look great and it was a very satisfying project, as the pattern is very precise and has some nice sharp corners, and the Youtube tutorial is top notch. I'm already living in these trousers. 👖 The only annoying thing was - as usual - the buttonhole. It's just _impossible_ to get anything bulkier than 2 layers under the buttonhole presserfoot. In the end I did the buttonhole "manually" by sewing two narrow rows of zig-zag stitching and connected them with a wider stitch. 

## w5 2023
- **Mycoremediation** - cleaning the environment with fungi - seems very appealing. And a lot of people are hoping that fungi can be found that can "eat up" plastic on land and in the ocean. Prompted by the question in the Future Ecologies Discord channel if there are any large-scale projects going on in that area, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole: [Bioremediation with fungi](fungi/Bioremediation%20with%20fungi.md). In short, there are loads of studies that show that some fungal strain can degrade a particular, isolated plastic in a specific form (often soluble), at a specific concentration under specific conditions (often with the pH and temperature adjusted and necessary trace elements added). The problem with a real life application is that plastics are very resistant to chemical (and therefore also enzymatic) attack, usually come mixed together with other polymers, are found in difficult environments (ocean, landfills) with or without oxygen, etc. Preparing the substrate in a way that the fungi will just gobble it up, is tricky and costly. Another (in most papers unanswered) question is if the breakdown products are actually less harmful in the environment than the plastic polymer. Will fungal degradation release e.g. plasticizers that then leak into waterways? Will the fungi themselves become toxic? (There is this idea that oyster mushroom could grow on trash and then be eaten - is that healthy?) Fungi also release CO2 and throught he plastic degradation also potentially methane and other substances - is that better or worse for the environment than leaving the carbon more sequestered as a polymer?
- On the weekend we went with Laika to a **dog bakery** in Gothenburg. It was ridiculous and wonderful. I had red velvet cake for the first time and was a bit disappointed. It looks more impressive than it tastes. Or maybe a dog bakery is not the best place to evaluate cakes for humans?

## w4 2023
- Really enjoying the [Scales of Change](https://www.futureecologies.net/dragons) series of the [Future Ecologies](https://www.futureecologies.net/#home-section) podcast. Signed up for their Patreon, since it includes a Discord membership that seems pretty nice. 
- A job fair for plant-centric food producers https://terra.do/climate-jobs/climate-job-fair/terra-do-plant-futures-initiative-job-fair-2023-02-17/
- I attended my first hackathon this week! (I know, so 2011...) It was organised by [Foo Café](https://foocafe.org/) in Malmö and was about protein folding and the new algorithms that have popped up and become publicly available over the last two years: [AlphaFold](projects/coding/AlphaFold.md), [ESMfold](https://esmatlas.com/), Rosettafold, etc. The workshop leader was Amijai Saragovi, a Postdoc in the Baker lab in Seattle. (Here are the [seminar notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12SgqOSQw7aRS5qEVr360O8BdChmJv0Ng)) I've been meaning to look into this stuff a bit more for a while anyway, so it was a good opportunity to be "forced" to do that. We were a nice little crowd of about 10 people, working from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, with some of us (including me) going home to sleep, and some actually doing the whole 24h. My team tried to improve the sweetness of the protein brazzein by using a combination of MPNN, Alphafold, EMSfold, Inpainting and Pymol. 

## w3 2023
- Tried to make vegan [tamagoyaki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/) with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn't find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of [uttapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam)). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but [this one here](https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/)uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn't turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I've only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian). 
- Finally managed to get all my self-made clothes from the last 3 (?) years out on the bed, try them on and take pictures of myself. Started to catalogue them [here](projects/sewing/Made%20from%20scratch.md). 
- A good way to scope out which hiking routes offer sufficient accomodation and food opportunities along the way is to download the .gpx file of a route (often from alltrails, e.g. https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/orebro--2/bergslagsleden), then going to https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ and importing that file. Then in different layers and with different colours, things can be added. I made two separate maps so far, one for Bergslagsleden and one for Åhus-Karlskrona, with all the restaurants, supermarkets and hostels along the way in different colours. 
![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230122140136.png)
- Made vegan [hottokeiki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/vegan-fluffy-japanese-pancakes/), tasted very good! 
- For nice ambient music, Duncan's [Jamuary](https://duncangeere.bandcamp.com/album/jamuary-2023) on Bandcamp is a good listen. 
- Apparently, De Cecco is a much better pasta brand than Barilla (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XMTvAgpEw). I will test and report back. I do love Barilla's tagliatelle, but maybe there is better stuff out there?

- Made [Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)](projects/fermentation/Keckek%20el%20Fouqara%20(Poor%20man's%20cheese).md), fermented bulgur that apparantly will taste (at some point) like cheese. We'll see in a few weeks...
- Oliver Burkman's masterclass (2x2h) on **Imperfectionism**. Some nuggets:
	- Pay yourself first. I.e. dedicate the first 10/60/... min of your day to something you think is important and you want to do. _Then_ go to the necessary tasks like answering emails, etc.
	- You don't have to "clear the decks" to be able to move to the fun or important or more interesting stuff. To do lists are neverending.
	- Accepting your unipresence (i.e. you can only ever be in one place at a time).

- Fermenting Data https://fermentingdata.net/. Interesting project from a researcher from Aarhus University about "engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation".
- TO READ: An in-depth and interactive explanation of GPS https://ciechanow.ski/gps/
- How Mesopotamian beer was brewed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK4DMt8ARyU&t=873s -> Contains great excerpts from old Sumerian poems and stories about making beer, drinking beer and getting drunk. E.g. the story about the god [Enki](https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/) and his daughter Inanna who have a drinking contest and then she convinces him to give her all of his powers. "According to the Babylonian _Enuma Elish_ (c. 1100 BCE), Enki was the oldest son of the first gods, Apsu and [Tiamat](https://www.worldhistory.org/Tiamat/). 

> _In the beginning of time, the world was undifferentiated swirling chaos from which separated Apsu, the male principle personified by fresh water and Tiamat, the female principle defined by salt water."_ https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/ 


- It's fascinating that ancient civilizations had a quite modern-seeming idea of the origins of the universe - an undifferentiated, swirling chaos. 
- Looked into nice hiking routes in Southern Sweden for the Easter holidays: [Blekingeleden](https://www.blekingeleden.com/), [Bergaslagsleden](https://www.bergslagsleden.se/) or [Åhus-Karlskrona](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/sweden/skane/ahus-karlskrona) seem good so far.

- Protein structure prediction with AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5 It makes my head spin to think about what could be done with either accurately predicting structures from amino acid sequences, or even better to **design a function and then get the necessary aa sequence to express in a host**. THAT'S INSANE!! There's also now a thing called **"hallucinating protein sequences"**, which sounds like straight out of a sci-fi novel. There, random aa sequences are fed in, and the AI generates optimize the sequences until the structures resemble something that the neural network recognizes as a protein. 😵‍💫🤯🙌  

> _His team is now using this approach to design proteins that do useful things, such as catalyse a particular chemical reaction, by specifying the amino acids responsible for the desired function and letting the AI dream up the rest._ [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5)
