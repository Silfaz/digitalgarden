## w31 2024
- I turned **40**! ü•≥
- **Jason Lytle** had another lovely bedroom concert stream for his subscribers. So nice! 
- We walked up to Sk√•nes highest point, a whopping 212.2 m! It was named **Sk√•nehatten** in 2024 by a reader of Helsingborgs Dagblad.
- I spent 3 days in **Karlshamn** for work. Lovely town on the Blekinge coast, with an enormous vegetable oil processing facility (AAK) that extracts oil from 95% of rapeseed seeds from the Nordics. Maybe that's why the whole town smelled a bit like horse fodder. 
- The last two weeks have been pretty perfect weather-wise. Max. 23C, sunshine, breeze. I LOVE the Swedish summer. Don't know why Swedes leave the country during the best season of the year to rather bake in 40C Greece or can't leave the hotel room because of the heat.

## w29 2024
- Finished [**A Memory Called Empire**](projects/books/A%20Memory%20Called%20Empire.md) by Arkady Martine. Ursula K. Le Guin with political intrigue dialled up to 11, mixed memory-implant technology that reminds of the Trill symbionts from Star Trek. The writing is complex but beautiful and intricate, the lack of gender stereotypes is SO refreshing. Bit too much clever strategic back-and-forth conversations that lost me a bit at times, but the last quarter of the book was fast-paced and exciting to make up for it. 
- We walked another bit of [Sk√•neleden](trips/Sk√•neleden.md), this time [**L√∂ber√∂d to H√§llestad**](trips/SL2%20Nord%20till%20syd.md#SL2%20Southern%20half#Day%202%20L√∂ber√∂d%20-%20H√§llestad%20(21%20km)). The weather was great for it, as this summer so far has been - like last year - quiet cool (max. 20C) and overcast. Lots of ripe wild raspberries, lots of wildflowers and insects and butterflies; fields of potatoes, wheat, oat and barley.

## w28 2024
- I contain about 170 g of bacteria. This and more fun and interesting numbers in biology are collected on [Bionumbers - the database of useful biological numbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/Search.aspx?task=searchbypop). 
- I really want to try this veganised recipe for one of my favourite Austrian cakes [Marillenkuchen](https://veganonboard.com/vegan-apricot-cake-marillenkuchen/). Also, Ribislkuchen, which has a crispy meringue top. 
- My balcony garden has truly exploded into a green jungle now. It's nice, but there are a LOT of leaves, and not so many flowers, sadly. Especially the nasturtiums are growing like crazy, even though I avoided fertilising them (because it enhances leaf over flower production). So I looked up some recipes for the edible nasturtium leaves, which I will try during my holidays now. [Stuffed nasturtium leaves](https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/stuffed-nasturtium-leaves/), nasturtium pesto [1](https://larderlove.com/nasturtium-pesto/), [2](https://mytinylagunakitchen.com/recipe/how-to-make-nasturtium-pesto/), [3](https://askthefoodgeek.com/nasturtium-pesto/), [nasturtium soup](https://larderlove.com/nasturtium-soup/), [nasturtium kimchi](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/nasturtium-kimchi), [fermented nasturtium](https://steemit.com/food/@raincountry/fermenting-nasturtium-leaves-and-flowers-recipe), [nasturtium risotto](https://madelocalmagazine.com/2020/03/savorbang-creamy-nasturtium-risotto/), [roasted beetroot ricotta and nasturtium salad](https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Roasted-Beet_-Ricotta-_-Nasturtium-Salad-1642630), etc. 
- Maybe this will finally be my year of cold bathing (kallbada). As a first step I joined the local swimming group [S√∂derdoppet](https://www.instagram.com/soderdoppet/). If I start now in summer, and don't stop when it gets colder, it should be easy, right? Right?
- [**Against thermochauvinism**](https://www.solarshades.club/p/against-thermochauvinism ) - From Andrew Dana Hudson's newsletter. An interesting counter-argument to thinking that it's unreasonable to live in or move to cities in hot climates.
> _There is something Eurocentric, colonialist, even quasi-racist about thermochauvinism. Brown and Black people live in warmer places, and are then depicted as lazy or uncivilized for the ways they adapt to the heat. White people live in cooler place and are thought to be industrious for adapting to the cold. A siesta or a dip in the river is a primal throwback, while hygge is advanced cultural technology._

Cooling technology is often more efficient, more easily electrified (heat pumps!) and can conveniently be powered by solar energy which is much more abundant throughout the hotter months. So perhaps places with very hot summers are already more climate-resiliant than those in colder climates that will need to retrofit buildings with cooling units in the decades to come. 

> _C and I have taken to calling this season ‚Äúhot winter‚Äù: a time for staying cool and cozy in air conditioned spaces, writing and reading and playing games, venturing out for excursions to museums or libraries, and generally waiting for Our Great Enemy The Sun to lose its grip on the land._
- I have currently no intention to learn sailing, but I still watched all 34 minutes of [this video about the basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trwcNk8EeH0). The teacher is very good, and with simple drawings he explains how to handle different wind situations. It hadn't really occurred to me before that - historically - sail boats were limited by the wind _pushing_ the sails, and therefore tied to travelling on routes along the trade winds. Modern sail boats have sails more like airplane wings, which point in different directions depending on the wind, and can also travel _towards_ the wind. A good follow-up of the above theory video is [this more practical one](https://youtu.be/GjvNECA0Dqw?si=jzjvTAImjKqtOoyD), with a guy sitting in a boat and demonstrating things like luffing and non-ideal telltales. (Re [telltales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell-tale_(sailing)?useskin=vector): Who would've thought that the most important indicator in a boat worth many thousands of dollars are two little strips of cloth or rope?!). Finally, in the boat-themed link list, I can also recommend this FANTASTIC [walk-through of the innards of an 18th century sailing warship](https://youtu.be/4Nr1AgIfajI?si=6htmGNC6jTVgoPl0).  
## w26 2024
- Mama visited this week, giving me a chance to show her nice places in and around Malm√∂. Here are some of the highlights:
	- **Pildammsparken** with its many huge, old beech trees, with trunks like elephant legs. We saw a concert by Tensta Gospel Choir in the little amphitheatre there one evening. 
	- Walking along the sea promenade in **[V√§stra Hamnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4stra_hamnen?useskin=vector)** - an artificial island that's been accumulated since the 1770s and housed previously (in the 1960s) the largest ship dock in the world - with a view of the √ñresunds Bridge and Copenhagen on the horizon, [Turning Torso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Torso?useskin=vector) behind us. There's also a great skatepark and urban gardening area on an old shipyard ramp. 
	- [**Foteviken viking village**](https://www.fotevikensmuseum.se/), a 30 min bus ride south of Malm√∂, beautifully located at the seaside, with a lot of reconstructed buildings and actors that go about their daily viking life.
	![](projects/attachments/25%20Juni%20Foteviken%2012.jpeg)
	- Restaurants/Caf√©s **Lera**, **Farm2Table**, **Sansa** and **Caf√© No 6**. Caf√© No 6 is tiny and has a super cute little garden with tables and chairs on the opposite side of the street. 
	- Copenhagen's hipster district **N√∏rrebro**, with the street-arty park **[Superkilen](https://www.archdaily.com/286223/superkilen-topotek-1-big-architects-superflex)** and my favourite streets J√¶gersborggade, Bl√•g√•rdsgade and the cycle highway Den Gr√∏nne Sti over √Öbuen. And then on the complete opposite side of the city (1.5 h walk or a 30 min bus ride) in a formerly industrial area, **[Reffen](https://reffen.dk/en/),** an amazing, relaxed street food market with beergarden tables, sun chairs and soft DJ beats, and a view of the old town across the water. The waste incinerator [**Copenhill**](https://www.copenhill.dk/en) is also worth a visit, not only for the fantastic view but also just for the impressive building with its calm and constant, white puffs of water vapour dissolving into the blue sky. **Nyhavn** in Copenhagen is of course also a tourist must, and especially in the evening sun it's super pretty!

- **Hollyhocks** (species _Alcea_) are currently blooming like crazy in Malm√∂ along building walls, and it always amazes me how little actual soil is needed to sprout this enormous plant with its dozens or hundreds of flowers. The other plant that is _everywhere_ right now is **Common Mullein** (_Verbascum_), another impressive thing that grows to human height in just a few months. 

![](projects/attachments/25%20Juni%20Foteviken%2007.jpeg)

## w25 2024
- I finished **The House in the Cerulean Sea** by TJ Klune. It had been on my to-read list for a while, and was one of those books that had either 5-star or 1-star reviews. Saw it in the library the other week and borrowed it on a whim. Then read it within 2 weeks, the fastest I've read a book in a while. It is incredibly cheesy, sickly sweet, and predictable. But also lovely and heartwarming, and it made me feel things I haven't in a while when reading a book. So even though it's not a literary masterpiece, I have to say I did really enjoy reading it. The story is simple and not super original - protagonist who is a loser but very kind, magical creatures in an orphanage, a mysterious headmaster with a not-very-dark secret, comically evil people but also one-dimensionally good people. But there is a place for feel-good books, and I'm glad I read it. As one Goodreads reviewer wrote: "This book managed to make me cry over a button, how could I not give it 5 stars!". 
- Right after, I started reading **A Memory Called Empire** by Arkady Martine. It dives right into a complex sci-fi world of empires and colonies, ambassadors and neurolinks, with imaginative language and precise character descriptions that remind me of Ursula K. Le Guin. 
> A long, slow time on _Ascension's Red Harvest_, traversing the sublight distances between the jumpgates that were scattered like jewels throughout Teixcalaanli space. The see-skiff peeled open like a ripe fruit. Mahit's harness retracted. Taking hold of her luggage in both hands, she stepped onto the gate, and thus into Teixcalaan itself. 
- Almost 40 now, I had my first **mammography** this week. Gosh, I didn't know you could squeeze boobs that much! With Swedish v√•rdcental efficiency/coldness, the self-check in on the touchscreen took 1 min, the examination was over in 5 min, and the (thankfully clear) results were ready in another 2. In and out the door in 10 min. 
- It was **Laika**'s 7th birthday this week. She continues to be a very good girl üíïüê∂

![|500](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240622083252.png)

- The most charming find of the week is **[Spegeln](https://biografspegeln.se/)** cinema in Malm√∂. It's kind of old-school, with a nice foyer, a bar, comfy chairsm and little lamps. In the cinema hall itself, the chairs were arranged in pairs (though there were some singles as well), with little tables and lamps next to them. You could order drinks and snacks TO YOUR SEAT! I got an ice cream! The film itself was alright, **The Fall Guy** with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Fun and full of action, perhaps a bit too much action (and too long). 
- Brilliant as always, **Future Ecologies**' newest podcast episode [Everything will be vine](https://www.futureecologies.net/listen/fe-5-10-everything-will-be-vine). Do plants have visual perception? There are competing theories about this, from photoreceptors on the plant surface to a microbiome that sends signals. 

## w23 2024
- We went to the vet to get **Laika** a proper teeth cleaning (under anaesthesia and everything). Cost over 6000 SEK, of which the insurance paid... NOTHING. What are we even paying insurance for? Not even my sister, who literally works for an insurance company, has her cats insured. "Better to put some vet money to the side each year, in case you need it." was her advice. Are insurances just scams?
- I learned how to **crochet** granny squares. It's quite addictive, I've already made seven of them. Though I don't really know yet what to do with them. I have a vague idea about a [cardigan](https://hayhaycrochet.com/crochet-patterns/cardigans/crochet-cozy-granny-square-cardigan/) I found online, but is it really my style? We'll see.
- Here are some **videogames** that I really enjoyed playing during the last months. 
	- [Citizen Sleeper](https://citizensleeper.com): Atmospheric role-playing game on a dystopian space station. You're a cyborg, waking up after having escaped from your slave-like job. Your need for a certain drug makes you sign up for various work tasks that you can choose depending on difficulty, likelihood of success or morality. You can join one of several factions on the space station and hack into the station's system. Your capacity of being nice and helpful to others is often not a choice but rather limited by your resources, and you have to make tough decisions. The gameplay is a very simple dice-rolling mechanic, and the graphics are spares, but it's one of the most memorable games I've played lately. It felt like experiencing a well-written novel.
	- [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com): Cute and dark platformer with excellent game mechanics. You, a bug, explore an underworld kingdom that unfolds as you go, from wet dripping caves to crystal peaks to thundering worm highways. There are friends and enemies, chubby beetles and annoying mosquitoes. Some of the bosses and jumping puzzles were quite tricky and potentially frustrating for me, so I was happy that Duncan volunteered to fight or solve those for me. But otherwise it's very well balanced. Fantastic soundtrack.
	- [Outer Wilds](https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/outer-wilds): At first I was not drawn in and a bit put off by both the blocky, seemingly outdated graphics and clunky game mechanics. But man did that game unfold before our eyes. Duncan and I played it together, since I got too distracted and frustrated by steering the space ship, but really enjoyed solving the puzzles and experiencing the story. And that worked really well. It's wild how this game just keeps getting deeper and deeper into a mystery about time loops and interstellar travel, exploding suns and underground cities that are swallowed by sand. The hints are very cleverly placed and it feels like it's not holding your hand and you can explore things in whatever order you want. There were some genuinely creepy scenes, and the mood of the game is both folksy-cosy as well as a melancholic, looming dread of extermination. 
	- [Animal Well](https://www.animalwell.net/): Somewhat similar to Hollow Knight, in that it is a very well designed platformer that's very satisfying to play. Precise game mechanics, and cute graphics. Also, an underground world. It's got less story than Hollow Knight, but incredibly clever puzzles that have several layers once you discover certain items. It's a bit surreal, has dogs and cats in it, and also a very good soundtrack. 
- I joined a **modular synth workshop** after coming across a poster about it on a dog walk. It's a 4-parter in the local library, we're using [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/), and so far it's both interesting and incredibly confusing. The teacher is going really fast, and without some pre-knowledge of coding, music theory and acoustics I would be even more lost than I am right now. But Duncan is of course helping me, and I'm also watching some tutorials on the side. These two ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB-7vRnc5nw), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_rZKodSQPc)) were particularly good for beginners, as well as the book **Patch & Tweak - Exploring modular synthesis** by Kim Bj√∂rn and Chris Meyer. Here are my notes [Modular synthesis](projects/music/Modular%20synthesis.md) and [VCV rack](projects/music/VCV%20rack.md). 
- We made some **magic rocks** with air-drying Fimo and embedded programmable NFC chips. The (slightly silly) idea is that if you want someone to go to your website or find your Instagram profile, you can pull out a rock from your pocket and make them tap their phone against it. 

## w22 2024
- I finished reading **The Fabric of Civilization: How Textiles Made the World** by Virginia Postrel. It was a surprisingly interesting book that weaves (üòè) history and culture and inventions and chemistry together. I had no idea that there was a lot of silk making in Europe, that during the 1300s and 1400s many European cities had very strict clothing laws that determined what fabric or colour people could wear (and how the people then circumvented those laws), and that fabric dying was the foundation of chemistry and many pharma companies of today. 
- Went to **Karlshamn** for a project meeting. Sleepy town, but nicely located by the sea with a an extensive archipelago and hiking routes, and a smooth 2h trainride from Malm√∂. Will definitely go there again and explore a bit more. 
- My parents picked 16 (!) ticks off their dog after a stroll through the forest. YUCK! It's truly summer now.
- My company is a sponsor of the **Malm√∂ football club Malm√∂ FF** and raffles away tickets to the box among employees. On Tuesday it was my turn. Being in the box was a cool experience, felt very VIP and fancy. We got (plant-based) dinner, drinks and soft-serve ice cream and had a great view of the pitch. But the game itself... mh, let's just say it didn't convert me to becoming a football fan. After watching, and really enjoying, **Welcome to Wrexham**, I thought that I might want to be a football fan, but sitting through 2h of a game that consists mostly of passing the ball back and forth brought me back to reality.
- Had a cosy little **crochet evening** with my friend Tessa. She showed me the gigantic knitting and crocheting resource https://www.ravelry.com/. Drops also has loads of free patterns, and I wanted to make [this top](https://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=9133&cid=19). But I didn't get very far this time, my needle was too small. 
- Fascinating article from The New Yorker about solar storms: [What a Major Solar Storm Could do to Our Planet](https://web.archive.org/web/20240528201920/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/04/what-a-major-solar-storm-could-do-to-our-planet).
- Prejudices about capabilities shape what we are actually capable of. "Stupid" and "clever" rats both have the same ability to run through a maze, but our perception of one makes us treat them differently and influence the outcome. Blind people can echolocate and navigate their world amazingly well if they are not overly coddled. [How to Become Batman](https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/378577902/how-to-become-batman) from the NPR podcast series **Invisibilia**.
- After a bit of a break from my **guitar** practice, I've picked it up again. Currently working on playing the chords to Losing my Religion and the melody of O sole mio. üé∂
- Wou Creative organised the **Communitive Festival** on Saturday at STPLN, and I helped as a volunteer. It was fun and I chatted to a lot of super nice people. Finding nice communities in Malm√∂ is one of my main goals currently, and there is a lot going on. Alanna and S√°ri did a great job putting together a little guide to 35 clubs and communities in Malm√∂ - mediation circle, choir, urban art, analog photography, dancing, repair cafe, etc. I might join a **communal forest garden** group.


## w21 2024
- The **weather** has been loooovely for 2 weeks now - 22C and sunny. Quite breezy/windy though, because it's Malm√∂, but that's ok. Though North India is getting up to 50C this weekend, parts of Mexico hotter than ever at 40-50C ‚òπÔ∏è
- We played our new boardgame **Earth**. The goal is to fill your ecosystem with plants, grow them, compost them, and fulfil some objectives. It's nice. I especially like all the cards with different trees, flowers and mushrooms, and the range of ecosystems and terrains that you can pick. It's not very collaborative, and only in the very end competitive. You play more along each other than really _with_ each other, but it's still a nice activity.
- I started the well-known and -loved **Yoga with Adriene** on Youtube. Let's see if I keep up the whole 30 day program. My plan is not to do 30 consecutive days, but rather do yoga at least on the days when I work from home. 
- We finally sold the **Gothenburg apartment**! Relieved, but a bit sad. Also because we got less than what we paid for in 2017; the market was hot at that time, the interest rate low, and we bid with 6 other people to quite a high price. So we knew we couldn't expect _too_ much now, but for that we got a decent price. Eight people at the viewing, two eventually bid, starting 100 k lower than the starting price, but reaching almost the starting price again. 
- The **Southern Sweden Design Days** were happening this week. We went to Lokstallarna, a cool former train yard with spacious old brick buildings and industrial flair. There were some cool things, especially the student's projects were very interesting. Some stuff was a bit annoying though - either too arrogant-artsy, or too greenwashing. I did love a model of the Turning Torso made from tempeh, as well as rugs that look like petri dishes or aerial photography.

![|400](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240601171407.png)
- **Malm√∂ Garden show** also took place on the weekend, and Slottsparken was full of stands selling plants, garden stuff or locally made chili sauce, kimchi, or kombucha. We had Jamaican food from a food truck, and I bought a little black raspberry bush that will likely only get fruits next year. 
- **Lime Garden** played a free concert at Plan B. Short setlist, but quite good. I love [I want to be you](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=jFYemNmWI4M&si=mf5XScj6vcO4dDmk).
- Interesting **Standard podcast** episode with the director of the World Food Program: [Wir k√∂nnten den Hunger bis 2030 besiegen](https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000216337/world-food-programme-martin-frick-koennten-hunger-bist-2030-besiegen). 
> "Climate (change) is by now one of the most certain things. Whether or not there'll still be a war in Ukraine this time next year no one can tell, but that it's getting warmer is for sure."
- Excellent read: [Heat Death of the Internet](https://www.takahe.org.nz/heat-death-of-the-internet/). Yay for Wikipedia and local libraries. 


## w20 2024
- Went to the **dentist** for yearly check-up. She just said that I have very clean teeth and that I should keep doing what I'm doing. 
- **Workshop about community circles** at STPLN, organised by wou creative. It was a small group of people talking about different aspects of communities, and it was the first time I participated in a discussion round with a "talking stone" that goes around and only the person holding it is allowed to talk. It took me some time to get used to that, or mentally let go of the "normal" style of discussion and conversation. But once I had landed in that, it was very calming. It removes the need to have to respond to what is being said, instead of listening and reflecting quietly. And it allows you to collect your thoughts without feeling pressed for time or being talked over by someone faster or louder. So it was a really interesting and nice experience.
- Loud Numbers had a **vernissage** at Kulturhotellet Helsingborg on Friday evening. Their work was a  sonification and visualisation of Sk√•ne's forest fires in 2018, a particularly dry and hot summer. The whole exhibition was really nice, called Nature's Harmony. It featured Paul Khedra making music with plants, a tulip-shaped rug mural, a moss-covered heap, a life-sized sculpture of a kneeling person, a big photo of a Swedish forest, wax cloth drapings in the shape of beehives, and decorative pieces by Gothenburg's own sprayer artist Ollio. 
- For the first time in more than 10 years, I am without a **Spotify** premium account. We decided to jump ship after the most recent 20% price increase and declining quality of playlists, worse payment for artists and lots of ads (in podcasts) despite paid subscription. Since we pay for Youtube (to not be tormented by ads), we thought we'd give Youtube Music a go. So far it's been fine. There's a lot of stuff on it, including things that Spotify doesn't have. Bit tricky is to find the right version of songs, e.g. the "official" version instead of a video uploaded by some random person. Then of course Youtube Music also doesn't really know my recent music taste very well, so it needs more curating and finding things myself, but that's part of the fun. It got a bit boring with Spotify suggesting the same things over and over again. So we'll see how it goes. For podcasts I downloaded the free app Podbean, which does the job. 
- It was **Mat & Dryckfestivalen at Folkets Park** this weekend. We went for an early lunch, had West African food and enjoyed the sun. The weather right now is **PERFECT** - 22c and sunshine. 
- **Plant update**: I finally got all the soil I need (actually, I could use a bit more, but let's leave it for now). I placed all plants on the balcony and the tomatoes and peppers are thriving. Sunflowers are also coming up, and I've finally seeded corn flowers, poppies, nasturtiums and marigolds.

## w19 2024
- **Eurovision**. OMG. It's right now (Saturday afternoon, hours before the finale) a clusterfuck burning brightly and it's still to be seen how much worse it will get. First there were "just" the expected constant pro-Palestinian protests and "genocide!" posters, criticising Israel's participation in the contest while slaughtering thousands of people. That all came with the biggest police presence anyone had ever seen in Malm√∂ (a journalist mentioned he had only seen anything like it maybe during the G8 summit) - heavy rifles, hovering helicopters, snipers on roofs, constant patrolling, drones. One act in the first semifinals wore a Palestinian scarf. SVT started muting the booing in the arena when Israel performed. For some reason the Italian RAI leaked the numbers of the voting for the second semifinal, and it showed a landslide win for Israel with 40% of all votes (apparently Ukraine in 2022 right after Russia's invasion had "only" 25%), which in turn suddently caused Israel to shoot up in the chances for winning the contest. On Friday the Dutch contestant was excluded from the finals because of some undisclosed mysterious "incident" with a staff member. Irelands contestant accused the Israeli broadcasting agency of inappropriate comments and called for their disqualification as well. The European Broadcasting Union EBU is still very sparse on any comments about anything, keeping to their stance that "Eurovision is non-political", LOL. The French contestant stopped halfway through the rehearsal, just leaving the stage. Etc. etc. I love the colourful, crazy, tacky, tongue-in-cheek and uniting Eurovision, and I'm very worried that this will be the end of it. 

![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240511171204.png)

- I got a lovely book from Duncan's parents called "**Tr√§d i Malm√∂**", detailing all the different trees that grow here. I've much more consciously looked at trees when dog-walking (and right now is also the best time to see differences, with most of them bursting with flowers). 
- Fell into a rabbit hole about **[Schneitelung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneitelung?useskin=vector)/[Pollarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollarding?useskin=vector)/[Hamling](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamling?useskin=vector)**, since we have some many [Kopfweiden](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopfweide?useskin=vector)/[Pilevall](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilevall?useskin=vector) in the nearby park. The drastic cutting of treetops creates a thick and often hollow trunk that becomes its whole ecosystem for loads of insects and other animals, and has many benefits for surrounding wildlife and even soil and landscape. There's a nice Arte documentary I found on Youtube: [Lebensraum Kopfbaum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9az9fTMDvSo&t=44). 
- [Interesting Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/1cj3ds6/relationship_with_an_austrian_apologising/) about the differences between Austrians and Brits when it comes to **apologising**. I have to say that I can see myself in some of these comments, and it explains some discussions (miscommunications?) I've had with Duncan. 
- Malm√∂ city has so far impressed me a lot with their shared public space policies. It feels that much more in other cities I've lived so far, drivers, cyclist, pedestrians and public transport feel like equal participants rather than being mostly car-focussed. The bike infrastructure is great, and while there are big roads for cars, they have very frequent zebra crossings and cars stop for pedestrians. And because the big roads are just a few arteries, within city blocks it generally feels calm. Additionally, during the summer months (generous - from April to October) several streets are blocked off for through-traffic, called "**sommargata**" (summer street) and all along those streets seatings and plants pop up for people to enjoy. It's sooo nice! This year, they've even turned a usually bleak carpark right in the middle of a nice neighbourhood with lots of small restaurants and bars into a "**sommartorg**" (summer square), creating a lovely space for people to hang out, children to play, and the surrounding restaurants to expand their outside seating. üòç

- Visited the **Kejsaretr√§d** at Lilla Torget which is right now in full bloom, with light purple trumpets. 
- Met Beatrice, a potential **dogtrainer** for Laika. She was generally very impressed with Laika, calming us that her occasional snappiness with other dogs that she meets on the street is normal and that we don't need to feel like we need to meet every dog we see. We'll probably arrange a doggy date with her and her dogs to see how compatible they are. It would be nice to have a solid option for dog boarding in case we want to go somewhere without Laika. 
- Went to the 1st of May demonstrations organised by the left party (V√§nsterpartiet) with Anna. 
- **Mitt M√∂llan** organised a spring market and we got some nice earrings, a lino print, a poster, vegan pralines and a pretty mug. I don't buy many things these days, but it's always nice to support small local artists. 
- **Grandaddy** (i.e. Jason Lytle) had a little live living room concert for their fan club (which I am part of). It was lovely üíï
- We went on a guided excursion through **Limhamns kalkbrott**, organised by [Vilda Malm√∂](https://malmo.se/Uppleva-och-gora/Natur-och-parker/Vilda-Malmo.html). Usually it's not allowed to go into the area of the former quarry. It was really impressive - it's this massive hole in the middle of Malm√∂'s outskirts that has developed into its own ecosystem.

- [This Nature podcast episode](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01158-6) was both educational and entertaining: **_Living on Mars would suck - here's why._** It lays out the realistic scenarios of colonising Mars and Moon. Including incredibly sharp moon dust that clings to everything, ionising radiation that would probably require us to live underground rather than in fancy glass domes with a view, and the fact that a stable outer Earth colony would be a large scale, multi-generational genetic experiment. I'm still a huge sci-fi fan, but over the last decade or so I've completely lost my excitement for colonising other planets, since we're doing such a good job destroying our own. If we can't take care of literally the only known place in the universe that doesn't kill us immediately, what's the use in venturing out and trying to "re-green" Mars?
- I finished sewing two more **[Donny shirts](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt.md)**, one for my mum and one for my sister. I still struggle with the pattern a bit at different stages, but it also massively depends on the 
## w17 2024
- **Plant update**! The tomatoes are thriving, the peppers are doing well, the smultron I grew from seeds are still tiny, so is the lemon basil. Nasturtiums germinated a bit erratic, some didn't do anything and others suddenly shot up. Of the smultron I got as plants from my parents a few survived and look good, and a few dried out. 

![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425073939.png)

- Duncan's parents were here for a week, and we did a lot of nice **touristy Malm√∂ things**. Malm√∂ is not such a "flashy" city as Stockholm, Copenhagen, or even Gothenburg. It's a bit harder to find places that make tourists go "oh, let's take a picture". Partly because it's so flat, it rarely offers a view. Partly because it doesn't really have many important buildings. There's Malm√∂hus slott, which stretches the definition of a castle quite a lot. But inside it's very interesting, explaining mostly about the times when Denmark and Sweden fought about the Southern part of (what is now) Sweden. There's the technical museum (which has a U-boat!), the art galleries Konsthall and Moderna Museet, the nice long beach to walk along, the inner city with old buildings and pedestrianised shopping streets, the indie mall Mitt M√∂llan around where we live, nice parks, amazing restaurants and bakeries, etc. They didn't run out of things to do. And when they did, they went to Lund. 
- I went to **Gothenburg** for 24h to paint some walls in our old apartment before selling. Not sure if it will make any difference tough. But also took the chance to catch up with some old friends and their kids.

## w16 2024
- End of April, and it's still not really above 10C here. I don't mind, I love being able to wear my puffy, light purple jacket. Though right now Duncan's parents are visiting and it would be nice to be able to be outside for a bit without having to briskly walk to stay warm. 
- **Yard Act** concert in CPH was amazing, such a good band! ("We make hits!!!") I was slightly terrified of the venue though, Loppen, an old seemingly completely wooden building in Christiania with quite a low ceiling. The old stock exchange in Copenhagen burnt down just a week ago, so I got a bit paranoid, and during the concert I only felt comfortable near the emergency exits.- 
- Another concert the same weekend was Duncan's performance of **The Carrington Event**, a data sonification/post-rocky piece about the biggest recorded solar storm in history. 15 min of guitar distorted and modified through modular synth, it was a really great performance.

![|500](projects/attachments/photo_2024-04-21%2010.06.54.jpeg)

- And yet another concert, the same day as Duncan's performance, was our friend's band **Baula**'s album release gig at Grand in Malm√∂. I love Baula's music, especially mercury in retrograde is my current favourite. 
- For some reason I can tolerate things in other languages that I couldn't in my mother tongue. Trash TV is one of them. I really enjoyed watching Love is blind Sweden. Now Aurora and I discovered that we both want to practice our Swedish and enjoy watching Trash TV, so we met up virtually to start watching the newest season of **Gift vid f√∂rsta √∂gonkastet** together. It was really fun! 
- Speaking of reality TV: a new season of **Race across the world** just started, and at least that's something that Duncan can also tolerate. They are travelling from Hokkaido to Indonesia. Thank god for public transport, I really didn't want a repetition of last year's stressful constant hitchhiking through Canada. 
- Useful video about [How to style a midi skirt video](https://youtu.be/4hnd_MboUqQ?si=nFQIvLeDaXHGiNif). 
- All my **plants** are growing nicely, so far still all inside. I got some forest strawberry plants from my parent's garden that should give fruit basically from spring to autumn. I potted the morning after I returned from Austria, and a few looked immediately quite good, but others seemed dead. But now even the dead-looking ones have new growth in the middle, so maybe all of them survived! üôå
- I joined **Grandaddy's GooDs fanclub** for 100 USD a year. I love this band so much, so happy to support them in this way. Maybe they'll have another living room concert stream soon, they had one a few years ago during Covid and it was sooo nice. 


## w15 2024
- Went to **Austria** for a long weekend for Onkel Christian's 70th birthday celebrations. I did the travel down all in one day by train, leaving Malm√∂ at 6:30 in the morning. I was supposed to arrive in Wels at 20:30, but my connection in N√ºrnberg was an hour delayed and that caused later connections to not work, etc. In the end my parents picked me up from Attnang-Puchheim and we arrived home just before 12. Long day, but I got a ton of work done on the train, because at least I always had a good seat and an electricity connection. 
- Austria had a strange spring **heat wave** over Easter and the week after, and it was up to 26C when I was there. On the weekend we sat outside in short sleeves, then on Monday it rained and cooled down massively again. Two days later, the weather forecast predicted rain. 
- The difference in **flora** was quite stark when travelling out of Sweden through Germany and Austria. While in the South of Sweden (let's not talk about the North, they still have snow) the buds on trees juuust now start to open, Germany and Austria are already green and lush. 
- **Fauna** was also interesting in Austria. It seemed like every single Gasthaus we went to had some sort of animals nearby. One had tiny horses, another alpacas and goats. We even did an alpaca walk one day, which was fun. Very gentle and stubborn creatures. Obviously, there were also more insects than at this time in Sweden, cats running around near by parent's house, and various dogs in various places.

## w14 2024
- Just came home from a swift 24h in Gothenburg. We had to go there to pick up a few last pieces from the apartment and meet the real estate agent. On the way to GBG the train was _completely_ overcrowded and no seat reservations were possible, so we were standing for 3.5h. I listened to 3 episodes of the great **Empire** podcase. Currently I'm on the Ottoman Empire. On the way back to Malm√∂ I watched a lot of sewing Youtube videos. I really like [Sew Anastasia](https://youtu.be/Giq-uaxMKiM?si=qN4fjmMTTc3zBQ2T)'s channel, e.g. how to **make a cute blouse** out of a large button-down shirt. Also, [this](https://youtu.be/7D-gxaie6UI?si=dfhDuAt-bV6ikjxm) in-depth lecture about **Tuberculosis** is very interesting. And this video about **NY's billionaires' row** of skyscrapes by The B1M not only goes into the structural details of ultra-thin buildings, but also into the socioeconomic details of inflated real estate prices and tax loopholes of the super-rich. And finally, embarrassingly, I only recently learned that the **spine** is actually completely fused to the pelvic bones! Here's a little [video](https://youtu.be/yK-8ZwLFarc?si=8uO-IQRZdYKap9ls) showing how. 
- Easter Monday was chilly and overcast, but I still wanted to go for a longer walk (but maybe not quite a hike). We ended up walking from M√∂llev√•ngstorget to [Bulltofta rekreationsomr√•de](https://malmo.se/Uppleva-och-gora/Natur-och-parker/Bulltofta-rekreationsomrade.html) and back (15 km in total). No leaves on the trees yet, so everything was still a bit barren, but it will be lovely in a few weeks.
- I finished reading **De som inte syns** by Micha Foss-Ghazarian. I bought it back when we lived in Gothenburg, because it is a crime novel set in Gothenburg. It's the author's first book, and it would need some more editing to make the story more gripping, but for practising my Swedish it was pretty good. 
- Went to Naturkompaniet and spent about half an hour flipping through Hiking in Sweden guide books. [**Blekingeleden**](trips/Blekingeleden.md) looks really nice, it's been on my radar for a while. Also, a friend wants to hike St. Olof's leden, but 30 days is a bit of a major commitment. 
- We celebrated our 11 year anniversary by eating at **Manto**, a plant-based Afghan-ish restaurant in Malm√∂. It was _pouring_ outside, but inside it was super cosy and the food was delicious, especially the dessert: Rose-saffron-coconut ice cream with cardamom soan papdi. OMG so good.

![|500](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240408194947.png)

## w13 2024
- Easter holidays! I took the whole week off. Did loads of stuff. Too much? Perhaps.
- Lots of sewing, mostly finishing some pieces on my "to fix" pile. I repaired _three_ of Duncan's trousers that had ripped pockets and/or ripped knees. The knees I embroidered with **visible mending**. I also made a wearable toile of the [**Helmi trench blouse and tunic dress**](projects/sewing/Helmi%20trench%20blouse%20and%20tunic%20dress.md) from an old bedsheet that was starting to disintegrate on one end. It has a hidden button placket! That's a first.
- I also **dyed** my corduroy [Stacker Jacket](projects/sewing/Stacker%20Jacket.md) a darker shade of blue. Originally it was very light blue, then it got some stains that didn't come out, so I dyed it light turquoise about a year ago, but it got blotchy and the colour didn't really fit me. Now it's more of a denim blue and I've already worn it more in the past week then in the previous year. So that's a win.
- We walked part of [**Sk√•neleden**](trips/Sk√•neleden.md) North to South, continuing where we left off last Easter in H√∂rby. We only did one leg (Duncan had to work during the rest of the week), so we only managed to get to L√∂ber√∂d (23 km) before taking the bus back home. But it was super nice, especially the part along the old train line on the shore of Finsj√∂n, and R√∂varekulan. So much wild garlic!

![|500](projects/attachments/2024-04-08%2019.58.45.jpg)

- I watched Netflix's new series **3 Body Problem**. Some years ago I tried to read Liu Cixin's novel, but couldn't focus and stopped again after a few dozen pages. The Netflix series has a slightly different setting, but I did really enjoy it. Bit anticlimactic ending though (for now). Maybe I'll watch the 30-episode Chinese Tencent version, because I am a bit annoyed at waiting 1-2 years for the sequel. 
- I also watched **Trainwreck Woodstock '99**. Similar to the Fyre festival documentary, it's a rolls in excruciating detail to the culmination of the disaster. It's very entertaining, shocking, at parts horrifying, and of course there's a whole lot of guilty Schadenfreude. 
- In preparation of the balcony extravaganza (see [Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md)) I cut down the Christmas tree that was parked there. Chopped off the branches, but kept them for now (for overwintering plants??). 
- Ate spinach on Gr√ºndonnerstag, as you do. Talked to three different real estate agents who all were different degrees of slimey. Picked the least slimey. Ate Juicy Marbles surprisingly realistic "meat" chunks (but what do I know, it's been over a decade since I last ate meat). Was good, but overpriced (150 SEK for two small pieces). 
- I finished reading **Der beste Platz zum Leben** (by Anne Weiss), a book I had gifted my mum for Christmas, and she gave it back to me to read myself. The author tests different ways and places to live - countryside, eco-commune, yurts, Berlin flat, etc. - and also writes a lot about the current housing situation in (mostly) Germany. It was interesting, but went far too much into detail about the German housing market, and was too little in my opinion about the real living experiments. Her conclusion was that it's important to start early on thinking about what and how you want to live when you're older. And that it's crucial to identify what is really important for yourself (e.g. not having to be dependent on a car). 
- Change to summer time. Ugh. Everyone hates it, everyone agrees that it should be abolished, but still we can't decide what the "forever time" should be. Given that not even this simple problem can be solved, I'm somewhat pessimistic about the infinitely more complex questions like climate change and biodiversity collapse.  

## w12 2024
- I started planting some **seedlings** indoors (cherry tomato, snack pepper, peppermint, tagetes, wild strawberries) for my big balcony [Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md) a few weeks ago. So far only the tomatoes and the peppers have germinated. 
- Today is Palm Sunday and I took the whole of next week off work! At least a few of these days we want to walk the second half of [**Sk√•neleden**](trips/Sk√•neleden.md) North-South. We walked the first half last year at Easter. Then we did 5 days in a row with overnight stays, but this time we want to do it spread out over some single day hikes, because we live much closer to the trail. 
- Last week, I finished the second **woodworking course** module at ReFab Lab, where I learned all about joining two pieces of wood together: box joings, mitre joints, half laps, full laps, etc. We got to use the router, which is super fun. When using the machinery with rotating, sharp parts I have all these intrusive thoughts about touching the blade, etc. But it gets better the more I use the equipment. 
- I also went to a **pottery afternoon** to Artibus, part of Duncan's Christmas present. I made six different things in two hours. Should be able to pick them up any day now. 
![|500](projects/attachments/IMG_20240225_115635.jpg)
- Last season of **The Expanse**. I still love it, though the constant fighting between factions and Earthers, Martians, Inners, Belters, etc. gets a bit tiring. The world right now is in a grim state (Palestine, Ukraine, ...), so I could use some peacemaking and getting along with each other, even if it's only fictional. What I particularly like about The Expanse compared to many other sci-fi shows is that the space travel actually seems believable. Having said that, I also starting watching the **Dune** movie, because part 2 was just released in the cinema and I want to see it, but need to catch up first. It's bombastic, slow, theatrical opera. Quite enjoyable, but I need to be in the right mood to be able to sit through it.
- We are starting our **apartment selling** process. Last week we went to Gothenburg to receive the keys from our tenants and now we're looking for a m√§klare. Hemnet is of course _the_ Swedish real estate site, and all apartments look idential: white, minimalistic, styled, unpersonal. So ours needs to look like that as well. Currently it's completely empty and perhaps needs a paint job. But I don't want to paint over our nice Tapetorama wall papers: one graphic, one slightly childish one with thunderstorm clouds. 
- **IDLES** concert in Copenhagen was fun, but we left halfway through because I didn't feel well and standing in a crowd of drunk, smelly people, not seeing a thing on stage didn't help. Another concert that was a lot more chill was **Elin Piel **in Inkonst - ambient modular synth music.
- Had a consultancy call about **mycoprotein**. It's nice to still be a little connected to the alternative protein and fungal cultivation field. If anything, it gives me a reason to keep myself updated. 
- My cousin Carina and her boyfriend visited Malm√∂, which was very nice. We went to some fantastic restaurants - one of which (Rue Hamra Meza Beirut) literally filled the whole table with platters of (vegetarian) mezze. 
- The oatgurt that I helped develop finally launched. Currently only in the DACH market and Netherlands, but I hope that we can also get it in Sweden soon. I love it, it's the best vegan yogurt I've ever had (totally unbiased, obvs).

## w7 2024
- Happy Chinese New Year! Baohong at work brought some Chinese sweets to celebrate. 
- Tuesday was Fettisdagen/Faschingsdienstag/Shrove Tuesday, which in Sweden of course means semla. I had pre-ordered a semla at our local bakery Farina, but just when I wanted to pick it up I got a text that their booking system had messed up and I wouldn't get my semla today (but could pick up a free one any other day in the next 2 weeks). To be honest, I wasn't too sad about it because semlor are quite rich and creamy and I wasn't in the mood for that on Tuesday evening. So I'm still looking forward to my yearly semla. I'll report back next week. 
- Yesterday was the first sunny day in a weeks filled with dreary grey sky, rain and wind. What a difference! We had "maintenance day" planned, a quarterly day where we fix things in the apartment. I repotted some plants, we put non-slippy things on the carpets and felt-things on the scratchy chair legs, Duncan sharpened the knives, and I cleaned all the windows. We also semi-successfully tried to beat the carpets and mattress on the balcony. 
- **Grandaddy's Blue Wav** album was released this week, and it's of course lovely üíï Quite heart-breaky and melancholic, but very sweet.
- We went to see **Alessandro Cortini** in Inkonst on Friday - synth music in a dark room with cool visuals. The bass was _insane_, I've never felt music that much. At times I was wondering if it was still healthy. Not the volume, but the amount of vibration that I felt in my whole body. Quite an experience. 
- I ordered 120 L of gardening soil for my upcoming balcony project. I've been collecting inspiration and information about what to grow and how, e.g. here: [General balcony gardening tips](projects/plants/General%20balcony%20gardening%20tips.md), [Inspiration pictures](projects/plants/Inspiration%20pictures.md), and [Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md). I got the soil delivered from Bauhaus, because I didn't want to drag it halfway across the city on a bus. 
- Today it's [Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)-making day with Anna.
## w6 2024
- I went to the cinema again for the first time since before the pandemic! It was very nice. Went with my friend Anna to see **Perfect Days**, a Wim Wenders movie about a public toilet cleaner in Tokyo. Calm and slow, almost meditative. 
- We saw a music and light show in St. Pauli church in Malm√∂. The music was described as "deep house techno ambient undervattenk√§nsla". It lasted 50 min and I got into a nice state of calmness and reflection. I thought about the benefit of being "forced" to sit with yourself and your thoughts for an hour, and that religion and church services - if I have *anything* good to say about them - can provide that. 
- My woodcraft course started, after it had to be postpones by a week because of a "blizzard". I learned how to use table saw, mitre saws and drill press, how to join corners and insert splines, how to measure things well, how to rip and cut wood, etc. It's fun and we are a very nice small group of people. 
- For Stefan and Stephan Stefan's 40th birthday party I went to Austria. I booked a capsule in the √ñBB Nightjet capsule wagons and really enjoyed it. The only downside really was the cold air ventilation that robbed me of my sleep on the way to Vienna. On the way back I wore my jacket the whole night and was very cosy. Vienna was spring-like with up to 14 c and sunshine. Was nice to see old friends - Martina, Stephan, Stefan, Michi, Teresa, Berntsch, Lebi - even though it felt a bit stiff and school reunion-like at times. Mama, Papa and Luna came also, and we had lunch and coffee with Tante Irmi and Onkel Bertram (who had just fallen down the stairs a few days earlier and had his head wrapped in gauze). 
- With Angie I went to Gartenbaukino and saw **Poor Things**. Crazy, lots of explicit sex scenes, and surprisingly fun. 
- Finished reading **Craig Mod's [Things Become Other Things](projects/books/Things%20Become%20Other%20Things.md)**. Loved the mix of autobiography, descriptions of Japan and the beautiful photos. Really a work of art this book. I read it slowly over a few weeks to really enjoy it and not race through (though you _could_ read it in 2h). It made me REALLY want to go on a multi-day walk again this spring, but not sure if we can fit it into our schedule with work and family visits and the Gothenburg apartment sale.

## w3 2024
- I got a haircut! I have a **fringe** now, and a mid-parting. My millenial self has to be strong not to swipe the hair to the side again. Slowly getting used to the look and the feeling of hair constantly hanging just above my eyes. But I thought it's nice with a change sometimes.
- Moving to Sk√•ne, and especially Southern Sk√•ne, I really expected to not see snow in the winter at all. But this year so far has been kind to me. When we moved to Malm√∂ in November, I made a bet with Duncan walking past the lake in Pildammsparken that it will never completely freeze over. Already a few weeks later I was proven wrong because we had a period with snow and freezing temperatures. Then over Christmas it was warm and wet again, but almost the whole of January now has been below 0 and on-and-off snow. There were even a few dramatic scenes on motorways nearby where people were stuck in a blizzard for a day, and my first woodworking class was cancelled because of too much snowfall.
- Speaking of **woodworking**. I signed up for the beginner's class at [https://www.refablab.com/](RefabLab). Partly because I just want to meet people here, and partly because I miss pottering around in a workshop. I also got an afternoon of pottery class for Christmas from Duncan. He's already very well integrated into some things here in Malm√∂ due to the modular synthesizer community here, but I still need to find some connections. Sports clubs are not so my thing, even though playing in a team is probably the quickest way to make some close connections. I'll see if there is anything around crafting, fermentation, walking/hiking, gardening, refurbishing, etc. out there. Malm√∂ seems to be a city with a lot of different initatives - people that just try and start something; that feels nice. 
- Angie was here for a long weekend and it was fun to show her around. We ate Bento boxes at Mitt M√∂llan, had nice coffee at Caf√© Jesusbaren, walked along the snowy beach, went shopping (incl. in the dozens of second hand shops here), looked at Konsthall, etc. 
![](private/attachments/DSCF9407.jpeg)

![|400](private/attachments/photo_2024-01-21%2009.59.11.jpeg)
- I really enjoy playing/learning to play the **guitar** right now. In summer we bought a bright red electric guitar (Stratocaster-like?) on Tradera and first I tried JustinGuitar's app for learning. It was good and his teaching style is great, but somehow I didn't get hooked. Then I tried Yousician, and I LOVE it! It's much more gamified, bascially GuitarHero with some exercises in between. But it's so much fun to play along songs and get an immediate feedback how good you were, etc. Unfortunately I hurt my finger somehow a few weeks ago, probably Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and it's been burning and unpleasant ever since. Resting the hand over Christmas didn't do much, so I just started gently playing again. I warm up my hand now before every session with a squeezy ball, and that seems to help. Or it's just that the healing process takes longer than expected. I want to play some Interpol and Strokes and Muse, and maybe also post-rock kind of stuff like Radio Dept. 
- New Year feels already like so long ago... We spent a week in **Skillingaryd** in Sm√•land, far away from the fireworks craziness of M√∂llev√•ngstorget. Two days were very soggy, the other days were nice and snowy. Laika had a bad belly on the 29th, Duncan had a MASSIVE migraine on the 30th (likely partially caused by getting up several times in the night because of Laika), but on the 31st everyone was well again. We cooked noodle soup and watched The Big Fat Quiz of the Year on Youtube, an episode of Scavenger's Reign, and played a few Nanograms. Extremely chill New Year's eve. The train ride back home was calm and pleasant, very different from the train ride to Skillingaryd where I was trying to contain a Laika shaking with adrenalin for 2 hours because we shared the seats with two cats in carriers. 
![|400](private/attachments/IMG_20240101_094139.jpg)
- I tried some lino cut. 
- Started listening to **Flashback Forever** podcast. Mostly to train my Swedish, and I also like the Gothenburg accent of the hosts. Lots of LOLs. I've also watched **Love is Blind Sverige**, which was pretty awful and cringy. **The Expanse** continues to be excellent, I'm on season 3 now. I also started reading **Jag √Ñr Zlatan** to both practice Swedish and learn more about Malm√∂'s famous son. I'm one chapter in, where he basically only rants about how he is so awesome and his Spanish coach doesn't see that. 
## w50 2023
- It's been a while! We've mostly been busy with moving and settling in our new home in Malm√∂. We love it here so far: very nice area (M√∂llev√•ngen), cool stuff to do, great restaurants, nice parks nearby (Pildammsparken, Folkets Park). We already know some nice people here, hang out with our neighbours who have a small Samoyed puppy, I signed up for Friskis gym and woodworking classes, we already went to several music gigs, etc. 
- I just tested positive for the big C :(  I managed to avoid it for 3 years, and now caught it probably at the Christmas party a few days ago. Don't feel toooo bad. During the night I felt quite feverish, but now I'm just a bit drowsy and have a sore throat. 
- It snowed here properly a few weeks ago! In Malm√∂! Didn't think that would happen, let alone in November. We went out at 11 pm and walked around the park. The snow was SO soft and fluffy and gorgeous, omg. It lasted for about a week, because it was consistently below -5C. But now it's back to Sk√•ne winter of 4C and drizzle.
- Started watching **The Expanse** after consulting Reddit if I should read the books first or watch the TV show. Reddit was very split, but what convinced me to start watching was a comment that there are many good sci-fi books out there, but not that many really great sci-fi TV shows. And so far I love it! It feels the most realistic sci-fi I've watched (ever?). Starting on Season 2 today, because that's what's being ill is for! There was one thing in particular that I remember from one early episode from the first season, where a guy from the Belt and from Earth have a discussion, and the Belter asks something like "Why the hell did you ever leave Earth? To have the SKY above you, you breathe fresh AIR, you feel real RAIN instead of being locked up in a habitation hub!". And it made me think of the Mars colonisation bullshit that dickheads like Musk are trying to make a thing. Years ago I was fascinated by it because I like(d) all things space, but realising how we so incredibly stupidly destroy the Earth, and then as a solution it's suggested to colonise and geoengineer Mars?!?!! What the actual fuck. 
- We also started with **Welcome to Wrexham**, about the Welsh football club that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought. It's surprisingly heartwarming and makes me almost want to be really into football. 
- Books I've read lately: 
	- **How big things get done*** (Bent Flyvbjerg). Bit repetitive, as most non-fiction books that want to "get a point across", but still enjoyable and interesting. In short, more planning and more buffer (both time and money) would make projects succeed better. 
	- **Masala Lab: The science of Indian cooking** (Krish Ashok). Had to stop a quarter through. The writing was insufferable. The author things he's funny, doesn't get to the point, talks things up to "uuh, watch out, science!" etc. Bah.
	- **A prayer for the crown-shy** (Becky Chambers). Lovely, very similar to the first Monk & Robot book. I love her writing and the way she describes things. So evocative without  being poetic or flowery or too much. 
	- **The Immortalists** (Chloe Benjamin). Got that one from the library on a whim. Ok story about some kids getting told their time of death and how their lives unfold thereafter. Some things are a bit ham-handed, and there's not really a tense story arc going on, but I still finished it. Somewhat forgettable though.
	- **All systems red** (Martha Wells). First one of the Murderbot diaries. I started the second one and then realised that I should probably read the first one first. Nice original take on the whole human-androids-augments-robots thing, self-determinance, etc. Dry humour and still quite good sci-fi elements. Liked it. I just read that they're going to make an Apple TV show out of it starring Alexander Skarsg√•rd, but in my mind the murderbot was always female...?

- Duncan got **Covid** after going to England and was pretty ill for a while. We (successfully?) quarantined and isolated at home, and I spent the last two weeks sleeping in the living room while he didn't really leave the bedroom. Now the trees outside are turning yellow, the air is getting crisp and his Covid tests are finally coming back negative again. 
- I fancied reading a book in German again, so I went to the library with my dad who visited a few weeks ago. I got **"F" by Daniel Kehlmann**, and I really enjoyed it. Particularly the hilariously accurate descriptions of the catholic church service - it really reminded me of my childhood. 
- I miss **winter** ‚ùÑÔ∏è. Moving to Southern Sweden, close to the coast, as well as climate change makes the winters I experience more and more snow-less. Here in Sk√•ne winter is just dark, windy and wet, around 3C and perpetually overcast. Sometimes I lie in bed in the morning, when it's dark and my eyes are still closed, and I imagine being at home in Austria, 30 years ago, early morning, and just hear the "kkschrrr, kksschrrr" of someone shovelling snow in front of their house. And then I get incredibly nostalgic. I need to see and experience snow again this winter. Last winter we didn't go anywhere snowy and we had literally two mornings in Helsingborg where it was white on the ground (and gone by midday). 
- In preparation of a nice winter holiday, Duncan made something that I've been meaning to make for ages: [a map of Sweden that shows train lines and supermarkets](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/radioedit/clmw71b9g02ni01nz5nut01yv.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoicmFkaW9lZGl0IiwiYSI6ImNpZ2F4NGw1MzFhaDd0Zmx5NGtoaXBnZTgifQ.LKXJIMW7qqWDRD8QCnMqaw&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#6.69/62.379/13.295). This makes it **so** much easier to plan trips where we want to go by public transport, but also not be too far away from the nearest place to buy food. 

## w35 2023
- I learned the other days something fascinating about **raspberry pollination**. The reason why you sometimes see wonky little raspberries that just consist of a few segments (druplet) is insufficient pollination. Basically every single druplet of a raspberry (or blackberry, etc.) is a fruit and had its own pistil that needed to be pollinated. A nice, full, mature raspberry has 100-200 druplets. 
## w33 2023
- We've had a **Thermomix TM5** now for a bit more than a month, thanks to my work having one old one "left over" that I could borrow. At first we only used it for a few things and it felt more like a hassle to try to integrate it into our cooking routines. But the past two weeks we've been cooking almost exclusively Thermomix-specific recipes from the [Cookidoo](https://cookidoo.international/foundation/en) website, and I'm starting to see the benefit of having this gadget in the kitchen. I particularly like it for starting a cooking process by just throwing in a whole onion, some garlic cloves and some spices and oil, and then letting it chop and simmer while you prepare other stuff. It definitely shines when you make things like stews and soups, or also risottos, where frequent stirring on a medium heat over longer time is desired. It's not the easiest thing to clean, so recipes with multiple "chop, take out, clean, put in another ingredient" cycles are a bit annoying. In [Thermomix recipes](projects/cooking/Thermomix%20recipes.md) I have collected some of my favourite recipes so far and some that we are about to try. 
## w32 2023
- So it looks like we have found an **apartment in Malm√∂**! The Swedish rental market amazes/confuses me once again... So I have about 2 years of queueing points on different sites. Very occasionally an apartment has come up during the last 3ish months of searching that I kind of liked. I visited three (four, if you count the one where we were stuck on a train somewhere near K√§vlinge for an hour and missed the viewing): one was claustrophobic and above a heavy smoker, one was amazing but too expensive (though in hindsight we probably should have taken it) and one was cute, a bit oddly shaped and in a great location. For that last one we were on spot 19 when the viewing was taking place. During the viewing some people dropped out and I moved to spot 12. Over the next few days I first got to 9, then to 6. Still not much hope though. Then I was 3, and the message on Boplats said that they were checking the first one in queue for eligibility. Then I was 2, same message. And then during the end of last week I was on spot 1 and the message said that we might get it and that the housing organisation is checking our eligibility. WHAT? How did that happen? Yes, there is a strange little extra room that is half-attached to the living room. And the kitchen is fairly small. But other than that? What's wrong with the apartment? Or what's wrong with the other people in the queue ahead of me? Yes, there are some standard requirements, like not smoking anywhere in or near the building, earning at least twice the monthly rent, and some stranger ones like having a job that is less than 2h commute away. But still...? Well anyway, we got it! They'll send the contract in a few days! And I'm excited and have been watching home styling videos all weekend. I'm a bit sad to leave the considerably greener Helsingborg behind, but also chuffed about having a bit more lively city life again, meeting more people with similar interests, etc. 
- At work I've been doing more **lactic acid bacteria** stuff. I spread some yogurt on selective plates to be able to determine how many live bacteria are in it at different points during shelf life. Looks pretty good, I counted about 10^9 per g product on day 1 and then there's a steady decline to about 10^7 after 3 months. A billion bacteria PER GRAM! And that's not even that much. It's always mind boggling how much life there is in _everything_. 
- I gave audiobooks another try after watching a compelling video about **[the best books of 2023 so far](https://youtu.be/yu-o0uOylDA)**. I've had a lot of 60ies sci-fi lately and fancied a bit more contemporary stuff. Instead of the dreaded Audible I tried Xig Xag, which has a different payment system (you pay per book) and is not tied to a subscription. They had **Pod** by Laline Paull, which had high marks. But after listening to it now for 3+ hours, I'm not sure I want to continue. It's a bit boring and scattered. Lots of fish being nasty to each other. 
- In parallel I'm also listening to **Sommaren 1985** by John Ajvide Linqvist, whose other books L√•t den r√§tte komma in and M√§nniskohamn I absolutely loved. So far it's nice, but also more coming-of-age and less tense thriller than I'd like. They found a creepy mermaid, so hopefully something develops there. I don't get _everything_ of the Swedish, but enough to follow along. And it's very good practice. 
- The weather continues to be a bit dismal here in Sk√•ne. While everywhere else is breaking records with either temperature (Hottest July ever! Hottest sea surface temperature ever!) or floodings or forest fires, Sk√•ne continues to be windy and rainy at a more or less constant 13-16C. So it feels wrong to complain, but it would also be nice to have a few summery days. After the dreadful winter (windy, rainy) I'm longing for some more distinct seasons.
- I got my passport back! And I've had the most Austrian interactions in a while with the people from the embassies (both in Stockholm and Copenhagen) - chill, jovial, slightly incompetent but well-meaning. A bit like [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/15ob4bd/trafik√ºberfall_in_graz_mariatrost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of a recent armed robbery in Graz. 
 - There was some buzz about an apparent room-temperature superconductor from a Korean lab. Besides the fact that it was only published on arXiv and no one has managed to replicate it yet... Why are people SO excited about it? Woah, we can build maglev trains now! Well, we can already build _normal_ trains now that are fast and efficient (if maintained properly). But still many countries and governments don't. This is a solved problem (on the technical side).


## w30 2023
- In week 29 I went to a Finnish town called **Kouvola** for a work trip, a 1.5 h drive from Helsinki. Lost my passport somewhere on the way there. Otherwise the trip was good, even though on the first day it looked like we had come for nothing because one pump in the factory didn't work. But the pump was fixed the next day and my colleague and I rebooked out flights to late on Wednesday, so we could finish the trial. It was an interesting experience going from a lab-made product to a factory scale - there are so many new challenges that I didn't anticipate. Mostly that there is water in all the pipes that needs to be pushed out before product can travel in them, thereby potentially diluting your recipe. And the all the loss at different stages, because the ends and starts of pumping product from tank A to tank B are usually discarded. Definitely some optimisation that could be done there. 
- Finished reading **Story of Your Life and Others** by Ted Chiang. Over the last year he's become one of my favourite writers. He just combined sci-fi and maths and history and philosophy in such a unique way. And I love the unusual settings, like a construction site of the tower of Babel or a industrial age factory with clay golems. I preferred his other short story collection [Exhalation](projects/books/Exhalation.md), just because the stories seemed a bit more finished and self-contained there, but I really enjoyed it. My favourites were The Tower of Babel and Story of Your Life, which was the basis for the film Arrival. 
- Started learning **bass**, because Duncan is doing an online tutorial (and recently bought a bass second hand) and asked if I wanted to try a few lessons. It's fun to play an instrument again. Not sure if the bass is my thing though. I am not very good in even picking out the bassline in a song. I somehow feels like it's almost dispensable. And it's usually very repetitive to play. It doesn't have the same impact as the guitar it seems. But maybe that's just my newbie ignorance. 
- Apparently **chicken-of-the-woods** tastes more chicken than chicken itself (according to some dude on Reddit). That was enough to get me very intrigued. Now looking into if I can find it somewhere here in Sweden, or grow it. Is it possible to grow it in larger scale, like on sawdust? Or even submerged? 
- It was my **birthday**! I got a personalised Heinz ketchup bottle, a mini whisk and mini spatula to scrape out jam jars, the book "How big things get done", a very nice green pair of Fairphone headphones, some golden iron-on patches to cover stains, and Korean BB cream. Duncan and I went to Chay, the amazing vegan Vietnamese place in town, bought some cakey treats at Bruket Kaffebar, then I cycled to the beach with Luciane and even went into the water twice (a refreshing 16C!), played some Zelda, read a bit, chatted with family, had meze for dinner and watched an episode of Strange New Worlds. Pretty much a perfect day. 
- The summer in Sweden has been a somewhat underwhelming so far (usually 12-28C and showers, windy, drizzly, overcast), but I can't really complain because other parts of the world are literally on fire and July was the hottest month _ever_ in human history. 

## w28 2023
- SO MUCH **Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**. I'm trying to not rush it because I want to explore every corner of the map first. 
- I finished reading **[New York 2140](projects/books/New%20York%202140.md)**. I'm glad I read it, because I like to read more somewhat realistic (and ideally utopian/solar punk) climate fiction. But I have to be honest and admit that I didn't really like it and wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Towards the end I skimmed entire pages because I got tired of characters just talking to each other while some of the (imo) more exciting plot lines were hung out to dry. [The Ministry for the Future](projects/books/The%20Ministry%20for%20the%20Future.md) is better, even though I would probably also criticise that there is too much filler conversation going on. My preference for writing styles is concise and saying a lot in a few sentences. Carefully crafted sentences, without sounding overly lyrical. Some examples that I read are anything Ursula K. LeGuin, [The Mountain in the Sea](projects/books/The%20Mountain%20in%20the%20Sea.md), or some Japanese writers like Banana Yoshimoto.  
- Bought some **chayote** and some **green papaya**, because they had it in my local Asian shop. I had never used green papaya myself, and never even heard of chayote. I fermented them ([Chayote - plain and Jamaican-style](projects/fermentation/Chayote%20-%20plain%20and%20Jamaican-style.md), [Green papaya Thai-style](projects/fermentation/Green%20papaya%20Thai-style.md)): The chayote kept its crunch nicely but doesn't really have any own flavour (both good and bad). The papaya is also crunchy while also having a slightly fruity note. Next up is a big green squash that I found in the Middle Eastern shop. 
- I made another **[Stacker Jacket](projects/sewing/Stacker%20Jacket.md)**. It's so crazy to construct a lined jacket, especially at the stage where everything is inside out and sewn together with four sleeves sticking out in different directions. Then you just pull it all through a tiny hole in the lining and out comes a fancy jacket. I just have the buttons left to attach, and I'm dreading it. The jacket looks perfect right now, I might mess it all up with the buttons and those damned buttonholes. 
- While having all the sewing stuff out, I also made a **[Donny shirt](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt.md)** from leftover linen fabric from my [Tula pants & shorts (Papercut Patterns)](projects/sewing/Tula%20pants%20&%20shorts%20(Papercut%20Patterns).md). Everyone online said it's "such a quick sew!" but it took me probably like 8-10 hours altogether. I re-watched **Foundation season 1** while sewing. Such a good show! And season 2 is coming out soon, which is why I wanted to refresh my memory. 
- Speaking of TV shows: **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds** season 2 is also out now. We tried to watch the first episode the other day and realised we had no clue what actually happened in the last season. So we watched a recap video on Youtube. Now I feel better prepared and I'm really excited to start watching because the first season was SO GOOD!


## w22 2023
- Some learnings from planning, booking and now being in the middle of a 3 week train travel through Europe (Sweden-Denmark-Germany-Netherlands-Belgium-Luxembourg-Germany-Austria-Germany-Sweden). With our dog üê∂.
	- _Don't chain trains._ Delays **will** occur. It's so much nicer, and less stressful to stop more frequently, only have a few hours of train travel each day, arrive in the next destination earlier in the day and have a chance to explore it a bit. Also, delays won't bother you if you don't have to catch another train. More time to read! 
	- _Don't be overly ambitious_. We usually left a place at around 10, that leaves time for a nice breakfast and morning walk. Then buy a snack, get on the train for a few hours. Dog sleeps, we read, listen, watch, chat, snooze, eat. Early afternoon, we arrive, walk to the hotel, drop off our stuff, rest a bit and then head out for exploring the city and look for a nice caf√© or restaurant for early dinner. 
	- _Pick **one** thing to see in each place_. Even in the most boring seeming places, there is _something_ to explore. It's good to look that thing up before you arrive, so the visits in the various places are not all just aimless wandering. It can be nice to aimlessly wander, but it also gets a bit tiring. For example in Kolding, we visited the model village [Miniby](https://koldingminiby.dk/da_dk/) and the botanical garden around it. In Hamburg, we went to the [Speicherstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherstadt). In Utrecht, we walked along the Oude and Nieuwe Gracht. 
	- _Bring snacks/food and water._ See above: train delays **will** occur. Therefore, always have water and some snacks on you. M√ºsli bars, some nice bread rolls, nuts, whatever. Don't bring chocolate, it might melt. 
	- _Print out all the tickets_. I did get all the 15 different apps for the 10 different inter-European train agencies, but to be honest, I still felt safer printing out all the tickets and bringing them with me. The evening before I take out the tickets for tomorrow's train, check the time again, and put the print-out in the front pocket of my bagpack. Then during the train ride, I can use it as a bookmark, note down interesting things to see or restaurants to go to in the next destination, and have it handy when/if the train conductor comes (Which so far has not happened! No one has checked any of our tickets so far!). 
	- _One luggage person, one dog person._ I took a small wheely suitcase and a bagpack, and Duncan took a duffle bag and a bagpack. And then there's Laika. In hindsight it would've been much smarter to put all our stuff into **one** (larger?) wheely suitcase. One person takes the suitcase, gets it on the train and stows it away. The other person takes the dog. Sometimes doggo needs to be carried into the train (many people, large gaps/steps) and having additional luggage is really annoying. Duncan ended up taking the duffle AND the suitcase, which is fine for a bit, but next time we'll pool. 
	- _The biggest cities are not always the best to stop_. We already learned this during planning when the hotel prices in Copenhagen were SO much higher than in 2-hours-further-South Kolding. But also Hamburg was a bit too stressful for my liking. The station is disgusting and a mess, and the way to the hostel was quite unpleasant as well. In contrast, Osnabr√ºck was a chill little town with a nice, walkable centre. The other advantage of getting on the train a bit away from the transport hubs is that the train stations are calmer. 
	- _RESERVE SEATS!!!_ Can't stress this enough. I would **never** attempt a trans-European train travel without seat reservations. An exception are maybe commuter trains that run every 15-30 min.

- The Netherlands produces an astonishing amount of food, both vegetables and meat. Here's an article that portrays the scale of it, and describes how it runs actually very energy- and resource-efficiently (or as good as possible): https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/netherlands-agriculture-technology/


## w16 2023
- This week I refreshed my Phython pandas knowledge to analyse and plot some fermentation data. From work I have a lot of recordings of fermentation pH and temperature values over time, and most of them are in huge Excel sheets and it's a pain to analyse by hand. But I'm always in this dilemma that my datasets are still small enough to be able to do it by hand, and it's usually faster than sitting down and trying to figure out how to program a pipeline for analysis, that would make things quicker in the long run. Anyway, I finally had some time and watched a few Youtube videos about pandas, and followed some tutorials about [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/. And - tataaa - I have now sucessfully created a Jupyter notebook with a pipeline that cleanes up my data, calculates some essential things, and then creates a nice graph. It still needs some improvements, like some loops over iterative file names, but in general I'm pretty happy that I managed to produce something useful. 
![|500](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230416160548.png)

- I finished reading the **thick** novel **Jade City**. It was recommended somewhere, and I saw it in the library a few weeks ago and just took it. I expected more fantasy elements; it's essentially a family and clan saga about mafia structures in a tropical, Shanghai-y/Hongkong-y island nation. Yes, they get certain powers by being in contact with jade, but that's basically all that is different from the real world. If you substitute *jade* with *drugs* it would just be a gangster/mafia stroy. There's lots of underground trading logistics, street fighting, fulfilling family traditions, rivalry, etc. I did enjoy reading it, because the characters and the story were described in a very vivid way, but I won't read the rest of the trilogy. Too much other stuff to read. 
- While reading Jade City, I got a bit annoyed - as I do ocassionally with other stories about "alternative realities" - that the power structures in the fictional nation were quite similar to existing power structures in the real world. Like, why don't authors paint more diverse visions of fictional societies, but instead always fall back to the common "men are in power, women are not as well regarded, foreigners are suspicious" bla bla bla. It's so tiring. Same in Jade City, where one of the few main female characters is an incredibly talented jade fighter, but there is constantly this undercurrent of her not being taken seriously, having to convince people much more than her brothers, not being considered for certain roles because she's a woman, etc. However, at the end of the book there was actually an interview with the author, explaining that this setting was deliberate to make it seem more realistic and relatable, instead of creating a _complete_ fantasy-world. I can understand that, though I would generally really appreciate more escapism in novels and descriptions of worlds that are a bit more diverse - in whatever way - than our current one. Isn't the whole point of making up fictional worlds that you can think up different ways of how things are run?
- A good summary of [what to do with preserved lemons](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/11/what-else-are-preserved-lemons-good-for-kitchen-aide)


## w15 2023
- This Easter weekend, we walked a half of **Sk√•neleden North to South:** [SL2 Nord till syd](trips/SL2%20Nord%20till%20syd.md). It was not only a nice walk, but I also learned a lot about the history of Sk√•ne and the areas we walked through, observed trees, birds and insects, visited the geographical centre of Sk√•ne and the location of Sweden's oldest settlement, and got to know several new mid-sized towns (H√§ssleholm, H√∂√∂r, H√∂rby). 

![|400](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2060%20of%20123.jpeg)


## w12 2023
- Finished watching **The Last of Us**. I thought it was excellently made. The way it keeps you on your toes, without being _too_ graphic or scary most of the time. And the way it has calm epidoses in between the faster ones. It was actually much more slow-paced than I had expected, but that makes the fast scenes even more exciting and important. Something I have problems with in newer Star Trek series, like Discovery: there's no time to take a breath, every single incident is threatening the whole of the universe, etc. You just get tired of the high stakes and everything becomes a bit meaningless. Thankfully, they manage to get to a better balance (and better storytelling) again in the newest (third) **Picard** season - it's really good! I'm halfway through the season.
- Also started watching the BBC show **Race Across the World**. I LOVED season 1. During the midst of the pandemic in 2020, I was really craving pictures and impressions from other countries and cultures, and it was so nice to follow 5 teams as they make their way over land (and sea) from London, via Greece and Central Asia, to China, Vietnam and finally Singapore. It was varied, both in terms of transport, nature and culture. Season 2 was North to South from Mexico City to Ushuaia, and it was also good but a looot of bus travel, since that's the only mode of public transport available in a lot of places in Central and South America. So we'll see how season 3 plays out now, where the teams travel from Vancouver to St. John's on Newfoundland, via Yukon and Northern Manitoba. So far, car sharing seems to be *the* way to go in Canda, at least in the part where they're starting from. The nature is amazing, of course. It somewhat scratches my travel itch, but it also makes me long to go to all of these places. 
- Inspired by Race Across the World, I read about **Haida Gwaii** and found several interesting documentaries I want to watch: [Haida Gwaii: On the Edge of the World](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/haidagwaii), [Hadwin's Judgement](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/hadwinsjudgement) and [Canda Over the Edge: Haida Gwaii South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBNlrk59bZ8). 


## w11 2023
- We visited [Dalby S√∂derskog](trips/Dalby%20S√∂derskog.md) on a half-rainy Saturday. It's Europe's smallest National Park, and it is indeed tiny. But still interesting to walk through, and especially to observe and discover all the things that grow and thrieve on and around dead wood. 
- [Crown shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness): 
 > Crown shyness is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavrious, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

- The discovery of vast - and somewhat renewable - **hydrogen reservoirs** ([article in Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)) all over the world might mean a possible greener future, sooner than with electric conversion alone. This sounds very exciting! I'm already dreaming of travelling without a bad conscience in planes that sprinkle water droplets out of their engines.
- I've been reading (and really enjoying) **[The Mountain in the Sea](projects/books/The%20Mountain%20in%20the%20Sea.md)** lately, and **connectomes** and brain mappings are a central part of the plot. Interesting (and somewhat scary?) that the real world is catching up: The brain of a 6 hour old Drosphila fly has been mapped and a connectome created ([article in Nature](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)). The researchers found some resemblance with how neural networks work: 
> _"The team also found that 41% of the brain neurons form ‚Äòrecurrent loops‚Äô, providing feedback to their upstream partners. These shortcuts and loops resemble state-of-the-art artificial neural networks that are being used in artificial-intelligence research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting that the computer-science field is converging onto what evolution has discovered,‚Äù says Cardona.". _



## w9 2023
- I've been reading a LOT about [Lactic acid bacteria](projects/science/Lactic%20acid%20bacteria.md) lately. Partly to reactivate a little dataviz project that I'm working on, partly because I also need it for work, and partly because I am of course interested in all things fermentation. The Lactobacillus genus recently went through a reorganization of the taxonomy, and there's a great [video/seminar](https://youtu.be/ErQbie690po) (by The Fermentation Association) with one of the authors about why it was done and what the new genera are. 
- For a while, **One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez has been on my to-read list. So I got the audiobook (in German) and started, but after about 6 hours of listening I have to say that it's just not for me (and I decided to skip the remaining 12 hours). It's a nice evocative language and I do like the [magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism) style. But every other person is called Jos√© or Arcadio Buendia (which just makes everything unnecessarily tedious to follow), and the story just trickles along without any build-up to anything, and there's some yucky marrying children stuff going on, and in general I just got incredibly bored by the whole thing. Not how I want to spend my time, when there's so many other great books to read. The historical background of South America in the 19th and early 20th century would have been interesting, but it was impossible to know what was actual and what was fictional. 
- One book that I did enjoy a lot was **A Psalm for the Wild-Built** (great title!). I saw it being described as "cosy core", and I like that. It's futuristic, utopian, solar punk, but very gentle and connected to nature. The main character is a tea monk, travelling around to find a purpose, and meeting a robot on the way. Best to read with a steaming cup of tea on the side. üçµ

## w7 2023
- Started watching **The Last of Us** about escaping the zombie pandemic caused by a filamentous fungi (the creepy [Cordyceps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps?useskin=vector) that replaces host tissue with mycelium). I really enjoy it, especially the video-gamey scenes, like when one of the protagonists snipes at hordes of zombies from a high-rise so that his friends can reach a safe zone.
- We finally decided on where to walk for this year's Easter Hike (this is becoming a tradition after [[Gotaleden]] in 2021 and [Kullaleden](trips/Kullaleden.md) in 2022). It's going to be part of [Sk√•neleden](trips/Sk√•neleden.md), the Northern half of the North-to-South route, 133 km from Vittsj√∂ to H√∂rby.
- I finished my [Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md)!! They look great and it was a very satisfying project, as the pattern is very precise and has some nice sharp corners, and the Youtube tutorial is top notch. I'm already living in these trousers. üëñ The only annoying thing was - as usual - the buttonhole. It's just _impossible_ to get anything bulkier than 2 layers under the buttonhole presserfoot. In the end I did the buttonhole "manually" by sewing two narrow rows of zig-zag stitching and connected them with a wider stitch.

- **Mycoremediation** - cleaning the environment with fungi - seems very appealing. And a lot of people are hoping that fungi can be found that can "eat up" plastic on land and in the ocean. Prompted by the question in the Future Ecologies Discord channel if there are any large-scale projects going on in that area, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole: [Bioremediation with fungi](fungi/Bioremediation%20with%20fungi.md). In short, there are loads of studies that show that some fungal strain can degrade a particular, isolated plastic in a specific form (often soluble), at a specific concentration under specific conditions (often with the pH and temperature adjusted and necessary trace elements added). The problem with a real life application is that plastics are very resistant to chemical (and therefore also enzymatic) attack, usually come mixed together with other polymers, are found in difficult environments (ocean, landfills) with or without oxygen, etc. Preparing the substrate in a way that the fungi will just gobble it up, is tricky and costly. Another (in most papers unanswered) question is if the breakdown products are actually less harmful in the environment than the plastic polymer. Will fungal degradation release e.g. plasticizers that then leak into waterways? Will the fungi themselves become toxic? (There is this idea that oyster mushroom could grow on trash and then be eaten - is that healthy?) Fungi also release CO2 and throught he plastic degradation also potentially methane and other substances - is that better or worse for the environment than leaving the carbon more sequestered as a polymer?
- On the weekend we went with Laika to a **dog bakery** in Gothenburg. It was ridiculous and wonderful. I had red velvet cake for the first time and was a bit disappointed. It looks more impressive than it tastes. Or maybe a dog bakery is not the best place to evaluate cakes for humans?

- Really enjoying the [Scales of Change](https://www.futureecologies.net/dragons) series of the [Future Ecologies](https://www.futureecologies.net/#home-section) podcast. Signed up for their Patreon, since it includes a Discord membership that seems pretty nice. 
- A job fair for plant-centric food producers https://terra.do/climate-jobs/climate-job-fair/terra-do-plant-futures-initiative-job-fair-2023-02-17/
- I attended my first hackathon this week! (I know, so 2011...) It was organised by [Foo Caf√©](https://foocafe.org/) in Malm√∂ and was about protein folding and the new algorithms that have popped up and become publicly available over the last two years: [AlphaFold](projects/coding/AlphaFold.md), [ESMfold](https://esmatlas.com/), Rosettafold, etc. The workshop leader was Amijai Saragovi, a Postdoc in the Baker lab in Seattle. (Here are the [seminar notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12SgqOSQw7aRS5qEVr360O8BdChmJv0Ng)) I've been meaning to look into this stuff a bit more for a while anyway, so it was a good opportunity to be "forced" to do that. We were a nice little crowd of about 10 people, working from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, with some of us (including me) going home to sleep, and some actually doing the whole 24h. My team tried to improve the sweetness of the protein brazzein by using a combination of MPNN, Alphafold, EMSfold, Inpainting and Pymol.

- Tried to make vegan [tamagoyaki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/) with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn't find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of [uttapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam)). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but [this one here](https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/)uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn't turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I've only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian). 
- Finally managed to get all my self-made clothes from the last 3 (?) years out on the bed, try them on and take pictures of myself. Started to catalogue them [here](projects/sewing/Made%20from%20scratch.md). 
- A good way to scope out which hiking routes offer sufficient accomodation and food opportunities along the way is to download the .gpx file of a route (often from alltrails, e.g. https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/orebro--2/bergslagsleden), then going to https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ and importing that file. Then in different layers and with different colours, things can be added. I made two separate maps so far, one for Bergslagsleden and one for √Öhus-Karlskrona, with all the restaurants, supermarkets and hostels along the way in different colours.

- Made vegan [hottokeiki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/vegan-fluffy-japanese-pancakes/), tasted very good! 
- For nice ambient music, Duncan's [Jamuary](https://duncangeere.bandcamp.com/album/jamuary-2023) on Bandcamp is a good listen. 
- Apparently, De Cecco is a much better pasta brand than Barilla (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XMTvAgpEw). I will test and report back. I do love Barilla's tagliatelle, but maybe there is better stuff out there?

- Made [Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)](projects/fermentation/Keckek%20el%20Fouqara%20(Poor%20man's%20cheese).md), fermented bulgur that apparantly will taste (at some point) like cheese. We'll see in a few weeks...
- Oliver Burkman's masterclass (2x2h) on **Imperfectionism**. Some nuggets:
	- Pay yourself first. I.e. dedicate the first 10/60/... min of your day to something you think is important and you want to do. _Then_ go to the necessary tasks like answering emails, etc.
	- You don't have to "clear the decks" to be able to move to the fun or important or more interesting stuff. To do lists are neverending.
	- Accepting your unipresence (i.e. you can only ever be in one place at a time).

- Fermenting Data https://fermentingdata.net/. Interesting project from a researcher from Aarhus University about "engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation".
- TO READ: An in-depth and interactive explanation of GPS https://ciechanow.ski/gps/
- How Mesopotamian beer was brewed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK4DMt8ARyU&t=873s -> Contains great excerpts from old Sumerian poems and stories about making beer, drinking beer and getting drunk. E.g. the story about the god [Enki](https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/) and his daughter Inanna who have a drinking contest and then she convinces him to give her all of his powers. "According to the Babylonian _Enuma Elish_ (c. 1100 BCE), Enki was the oldest son of the first gods, Apsu and [Tiamat](https://www.worldhistory.org/Tiamat/). 

> _In the beginning of time, the world was undifferentiated swirling chaos from which separated Apsu, the male principle personified by fresh water and Tiamat, the female principle defined by salt water."_ https://www.worldhistory.org/Enki/ 


- It's fascinating that ancient civilizations had a quite modern-seeming idea of the origins of the universe - an undifferentiated, swirling chaos. 
- Looked into nice hiking routes in Southern Sweden for the Easter holidays: [Blekingeleden](https://www.blekingeleden.com/), [Bergaslagsleden](https://www.bergslagsleden.se/) or [√Öhus-Karlskrona](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/sweden/skane/ahus-karlskrona) seem good so far.

- Protein structure prediction with AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5 It makes my head spin to think about what could be done with either accurately predicting structures from amino acid sequences, or even better to **design a function and then get the necessary aa sequence to express in a host**. THAT'S INSANE!! There's also now a thing called **"hallucinating protein sequences"**, which sounds like straight out of a sci-fi novel. There, random aa sequences are fed in, and the AI generates optimize the sequences until the structures resemble something that the neural network recognizes as a protein. üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§Øüôå
