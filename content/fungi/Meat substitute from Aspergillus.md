Study producing burger patties from aerobic fungus _Aspergillus oryzae_ (ATCC 10124). Growth conditions were optimized by changing carbon source and C:N ratio. Then, different recipes (binders, flour, spices, colours) were tested.

Carbon souces used: maltodextrin or glucose

Nitrogen sources used: yeast extract and ammonium sulfate

Evaluation by tasting and electronic tongue (TS-5000Z, Insent, Atsugi, Japan; can determine saltiness, bitterness, umami, astringency, and richness). 

**Results**:
- Best with 90 g/L maltodextrin at C:N ratio of 15:1, growth time 6 days.
- 17% protein content (measured with Kjeldahl).
