Why? Search for novel materials that support growth and differentiation of cells. 

_Aspergillus oryzae_ UCD 76-2 grown in pellets (0.9 mm diameter), then inactivated and tested for adherence of yeast (_S. cerevisiae_ ATCC MYA-245) or mouse myoblast (ATCC CRL-1772) cells.

_Aspergillus oryzae_ is edible, grows quickly on cheap substrates. Hyphae structure is dense and flexible, has hollow spaces and porous wall that allows transfer of nutrients. Protein-glucan-chitin composition provides many anchor points for cells. 

Inactivation: autoclaving (= heat-treated) or submerging in ethanol (= chemically treated).

**Results**:
- Inactive fungal pellets can act as support for cell attachment and growth.
- Heat inactivation worked better than chemical inactivation with ethanol.
- Next: In future experiments, cell attachment can be enhanced by modifying the fungal pellet, changing fermentation conditions, utilizing different species/strains of filamentous fungi, or engineering fungi with other desired properties.
