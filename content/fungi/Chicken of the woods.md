As food:
- Tastes best when grown on cherry trees
- Young specimens are edible if they exude large amounts of a clear to pale yellow watery liquid. Only the young outer edges of larger specimens should be collected, as older portions tend to be tough, unpalatable, and bug-infested.
- Some people have experienced gastrointestinal upset after eating this mushroom. Severe adverse reactions can occur, including vomiting and fever, in about 10% of the population, but this is now thought to be the result of confusion with morphologically similar species such as _[Laetiporus huroniensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetiporus_huroniensis "Laetiporus huroniensis")_, which grows on hemlock trees, and _[L. gilbertsonii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetiporus_gilbertsonii "Laetiporus gilbertsonii")_, which grows on Eucalyptus. Other sources say that _L. sulphureus_ growing on conifers is more likely to cause symptoms.
