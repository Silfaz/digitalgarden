title: "Growing yellow oyster mushrooms"
---

_August 2020_

Ordered yellow oyster mushroom growing kit from [Saxtorps Svamp](https://www.saxtorpsvamp.se/) in Sk√•ne. Took it out of the cardboard box and placed on dampened Vermiculite in a perforated plastic box and covered with cling film. Kept it damp by spraying/misting with water occasionally. Kept airflow (to remove built-up CO2 and replace with fresh oxygen-rich air) by occasionally fanning from the sides and top. 

It took a while for the mushrooms to pin (i.e. appear), but then it went superfast. In a matter of days they were ready to harvest.

I did not grow a second batch from the same block, it seemed like the substrate was used up already.
