title: "Personal action and reducing your own carbon footprint"
---

Another article that argues that personal action doesn't have much impact and that people shouldn't be too preachy about it: https://medianism.org/2022/08/15/you-cant-get-no-satisfaction-from-reducing-your-own-personal-carbon-footprint/

I totally agree with the premise: 
>Being self-righteous about your own personal actions against climate change can make other people feel inferior and cause them to reject the entire idea. 

>Our most important job as environmentalists is to convince the people who haven't yet been convinced that we should do anything at all.

But that doesn't mean that working on reducing your own personal footprint is pointless. Sure, it's much more important to work on collective reduction in carbon emissions than to fret about a piece of cheese you ate or a pair of trousers you bought, but who if not WE AS CONSUMERS should stop consuming? Fewer things being needlessly produced, fewer things being shipped around the planet, fewer things ending up in landfills and oceans. 
It's always presented as such a sacrifice, but I think many people (in rich countries) could live an equally happy, if not happier, life if their focus wasn't so much on accumulating things and spending money on status symbols. 

Anyway, I also agree that:
> There is an asymmetry between the efforts of climate-change environmentalists versus big carbon. Environmentalists spend a lot of our moral resources to increase our personal moral purity and reduce our individual carbon footprint. On the other side of the political divide, big carbon doesnâ€™t waste any resources on personal moral purity and so they can devote all their resources to influence the public spere to stop policies that would actually make a difference.

But big carbon makes a LOT of money and has interest in making even more. On the other hand environmentalists are not driven by profit and can't offer the same incentives to (corrupt) politicians as oil lobbyists do.

Overall, I agree that if you want to have maximum impact, it's much better to **look for actions with the most impact**, participate in organisations and events, be vocal about climate change and be inclusive and not alienating about it, than to _just_ reduce your own personal carbon footprint. 
But again, how is anything supposed to change if no one is making ANY change? Many drops make an ocean. We need both - personal action and collective action. One doesn't work without the other, it's a chicken and egg problem. 

**Actions:**
- Find impactful and public climate actions (including: donate to and support the actions that have the most impact). 
- Be vocal about participating in (fun) climate actions.
- Show the upsides of leading a low-carbon life style. It's not a sacrifice: not owning a car is freedom; train travel is fun, cheap and fast; repairing clothes is often more rewarding than buying  new ones; vegan food is delicious and healthy; hobbies don't have to cost money or be based on consumption.
