`People ought to be scared. They ought to support a big push. But this is simply a thing that is not going to happen in the time frame we need it to happen.`

Takeaway message:
- Doomerism doesnt' work
- Anticapitalism doesn't work
- Degrowth rhetoric doesn't work

We can't wait for _the_ big governmental push either. 
BUT things are already moving. Many "small" actions (state-wide, individual, etc.). 
`Everyone pushes wherever they can push.`

I agree that doomerism and degrowth rhetoric are counterproductive to getting more people excited to care about the climate. And I agree that going hard anticapitalism probably would result in more emissions than persuing solutions forming under existing capitalism.

But climate change is not the only bad effect of overabundance and consumerism. 

>Don't speak the language of sacrifice, speak the language of abundance (renewable energy is getting cheaper, so we can use more of it, electric cars are coming so no need to stop driving, etc.). 

Exploitation, pollution, destruction of ecostystem is still continuing if everyone wants their own electric car and wants to fly around the world every two months and buy all the gadgets and tools they'll never use etc. Encouraging people to not rethink their wasteful ways of living, just "make it a bit greener", robs us of the chance to rethink priorities, how cities are built, how society works, how wealth is or should be distributed and if we really need everything that ads and companies tell us we need.
