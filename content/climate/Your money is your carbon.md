title: "Your money is your carbon"

Banks are driving the climate crisis by supplying easy money to Big Oil. This calculation works for everyone that has money in the financial system. The money sitting in the bank is generating huge amounts of carbon by underwriting loans to Big Oil. 

If you have 125 000 USD in the bank, it's producing as much carbon as the average American in an average year. 

Depending on how much money you have, your bank account is two or three furnaces chugging all day; it's three or five or nine cars idling in the drive way. 

But it's relatively easy to fix! Switching banks can cut your carbon footprint dramatically over night. Or maybe even better, join a campaign to switch banks together with a big group of other people to make the bank notice.
