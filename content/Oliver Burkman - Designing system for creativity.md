## 30 day challenge
 Pay yourself first with time
 1. Start small. 10 min a day for a task you want to achieve. 
 2. Stop. Practice stopping if you set yourself a time limit, even if you're on a roll. If you keep your work portions small, smaller than you think it should be, you make yourself want to get back to that work. 
 3. Stay small. 

Quantity is the most predictable path to quality. You don't dilute your ideas by having a lot of them. 


Ideas are just actionable thoughts. 
- What if.... 
- What if I wrote about my morning routine?
- What if I made a hat for dogs?
- What if society was organized in a certain way xyz?

## Fixing a leaky ideas system
- _Problem:_ You're not capturing the ideas you have. _Solution:_ Low friction capture (carry notebook around, have easy note-taking app, etc.). 
- _Problem:_ You're not waiting for ideas to ripen. _Solution:_ Keep a bad ideas list (and get back to it occasionally).
- _Problem:_ You don't recognise the ideas you already have. _Solution:_ Idea templates/prompts.
