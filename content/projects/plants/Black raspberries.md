## Raspberries general 

- 2 m tall - support with stakes or trellis
- Sunny position
- Plant canes at least 15 cm apart
- Plant in mounds, so that the excess moisture goes down into the soil. Prevents root rot. 
- Don't leave them too soggy! They don't like that. 
- Watch for disease
- Mulch, to keep water in the soil and suppress weeds. 
- Feed with fruit fertiliser if available. 
- Autumn is the best time to plant raspberries. 
- Can be grown in containers, at least 45 cm diameter and 60 cm deep.

### Pruning
Raspberries need to be pruned every year to maximise yield and minimise disease. But don't prune before late winter or even spring!! 

Grey canes are totally dead, so they are easy to identify. 

### Two different types of raspberries

#### Summer variety (single bearing)
2-year cycle
Green and brown canes
One big harvest during summer. 
**First year canes**: Leafy growth, green. They will bear fruit in the _next_ year.
**Second year canes** : Brown, older, grown in first year and turn a darker colour in the second year. Berries will appear on them during summer. Once they've fruited, they are no good any more. 

Prune off at the ground level. But leave the new green ones!!

**Green canes** = new ones. Don't prune! Will bear fruit in the following year.


#### Autumn variety (ever bearing)
Produce both in summer and autumn. 
First year: Cane comes up and produces little crop on top. 
Second year: Berries will be produced further down the cane, not any more on top. 
So in the spring for pruning, chop off right below the upper part where there was fruiting, and leave the rest of the stem. This will produce summer crop. Then the new growth on top will produce the autumn crop. 

Version 1 of pruning: 
Wait until late-winter, then cut them ALL off at ground level. Easier pruning, no need to look for last year's growth. Allows plant to reserve all of its energy and plant will produce huge harvest. 

Version 2 of pruning: 
The canes that have fruited completely (both summer and fall) cut off completely. Canes that had fruit on top, cut off in the middle, just below the former autumn crop.

**Odling:**
Odla i en väldränerad jord på solig plats. De trivs allra bäst i en sandig jord rik på humus. För att ge plantan en humusrik jord kan du då mylla ner växtrester (t ex gräsklipp) i det översta jordlagret alternativt täcka jorden med ett lager växtrester.

Det kan vara bra att notera att det svarta hallonet är en högväxande hallonart, busken blir normalt 2-3 meter hög. 

Svart Hallon (_R. occidentalis_) sätter inte rotskott som det vanligare röda hallonet (_R. idaeus_). 

**Egenskaper:**
Årighet: Flerårig  
Växtläge: sol  
Höjd: 2-3 m  
Växtzon: 1-4

- Self-fertilising
- Summer fruiting
- Production reaches its normal level in year 3 after planting. One plant can produce fruit for about 10 years. 
- Special pruning: In **July**, trim the ends of the young shoots to encourage the formation of lateral buds. In spring, prune these lateral branches, leaving 8-10 buds on each branch. Unlike the most common raspberry bush (_Rubus idaeus_), new shoots on the black raspberry appear at the base of the stems rather than from the roots. 
- Overwinter: Can be left in the ground.
