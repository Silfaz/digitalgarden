### Slingerkrasse (Nasturtium) (Nelson Garden)
_Tropaeolum majus_
Annual
Radiant summer flower in yellow, orange and red. Ideal for hanging pots, trellis or as a ground-covering flower. Flowers are edible and are decorative in salads. Unripe seeds can be pickled like capers. Likes well-draining and nutrient-poor soil best. In too nutrient-rich soil the plant forms more leaves than flowers!
- Sow inside: **April, May.** Place seeds in water over night. 8 weeks before placing outside, put 1-2 seeds per pot into moist sowing soil (2 cm deep). Place at room temperature and keep light and cool after germination. 
- Sow outside: **May, June.** Keep soil moist until germination. 
- Bloom: **June, July, August, September**
