- https://www.thespruce.com/growing-pilea-peperomioides-5090425
- Nettle family
- Native to Southern China, grows along the base of the Himalyan mountains.
- Needs:
	- Well-draining soil, pH 6-7
	- Partial sun exposure, medium to bright **indirect** light
	- Semi-regular watering: Alow to dry out completely, then water well. About once a week.
	- Light fertilizing (once per month) in spring and summer, all purpose fertilizer
- Avoid:
	- Locations that receive harsh, direct light --> leaves will burn
	- Temperatures < 10C
	- Fertilizing during autumn and winter
- Rotate around for even growth
- Very easy to propagate the offshoots. Keep the soil moist until the new plant has established own roots. 
- Common problems: 
	- Curling up leaves: Not enough light, room temperature too high, room humidity too low, watering too much or too little
	- Yellow or brown edges on leaves: Room humidity too low
	- Browned leaves: Too much direct sunlight
	- Yellowed leaves that fall off: Too much water


### Hibiscus

- Needs:
	- Bright window with as much light as possible. The sunniest place in the house is best.
	- Like to be watered, but not over-watered. Once the soil is dry to the touch, water. 
	- Moderate to high humidity. 
	- Mist plants weekly with room temperature water. 
- For increased humidity, set up trays of pebbles and water around houseplants, and group plants together. 
- Avoid:
	- Temperatures < 10C
	- Keeping them near open windows
- Common problems:
	- Brown edges on leaves, bud droop, drooping foliage: Lack of humidity. 
- Pruning:
	- When young, pinch away the first few buds to encourage more blossoming. 
	- Prune in autumn/winter when the plant is semi-dormant.
	- Clip away the longest branches every few months to manage the shape of the plant and stimulate new growth.


### Calathea (Goeppertia)

- https://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/grow-plants/how-to-grow-calathea/, https://mylittlejungle.com/calathea-rufibarba/
- Native to Brazil, Amazon rain forest, forest floor (= warm, humid, indirect light).
- Needs:
	- Bright indirect light, but can grow well in shady areas too
	- Keep soil moist most of the time (but not soggy). Water 1-2 times per week. Water little but often.
	- Maintain high humidity (best > 50%). Mist the leaves or put pebbles in water nearby.
	- Soil that drains well and retains moisture (mix something moisture retaining - like coconut coir - and something draining - like perlite). Also good: 2:1 soil-based compost and perlite.
- Avoid:
	- Drafts
	- Direct sun
	- Water with high mineral content
	- Never let the soil dry out more than an inch on the top!
	- Temperatures below 18C.
	- Overfertilizing
- Common problems:
	- Burnt tips and edges: Mineral burning, i.e. too much minerals in the water. Use filtered, distilled or rain water. 
	- Leaves drying up or drooping: Too low humidity.
	- Burnt leaves, brown patches: Too much light.
	- Leaves that curl inwards: Underwatering
	- Yellowing or wilting leaves: Overwatering
	- Faded leaves: Too much light.
- Occasional lukewarm shower is good to remove dust from the leaves. Best with distilled water, as mineral-rich water can leave white chalky deposits on the leaves. 
- Very good for bathrooms (high humidity), but they do need some light.
- Give the plant a good trim to remove dried leaves. 
- Doesn't need much fertilizer. Half-strength during growing season. 
- Propagate by repotting: Gently separate the plants, disentangle the roots, repot into new pots.
