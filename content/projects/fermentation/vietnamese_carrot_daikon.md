_2022-07-25:_

2 days: Liquid starts getting a bit cloudy and slightly sulfuric smell develops. Daikon pieces are nicely crunchy, slightly salty and have the tiniest hint of fermentation. 

5 days: Liquid still cloudy, sulfuric smells not as strong any more (or have I got used to it?). Bubbles coming up, but not fizzy yet. Daikon is very crunchy and has a slightly sourness/bitterness to it. Carrot is also crunchy with slightly sourness/bitterness, as well as still a bit of sweetness. Leave for another couple of days.

7 days: Nice and crunchy, sour but could be more. Bitter note has faded a bit. Harvest!

Conclusion: Both the carrot and the daikon are very crunchy, slightly sour, and still a bit bitter (unpleasant). Also, it smelled really bad (sulfurous) throughout the fermentation, sometimes worse sometimes less bad. Was considering leaving some out a bit longer to see how the fermentation progresses, but I'm a bit sick of the smell. Will probably ferment a bit further in the fridge anyway.
