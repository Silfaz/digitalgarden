title: "Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)"

Recipe from https://365daysoflebanon.com/2016/01/09/the-poor-mans-cheese/ and https://macrobiotics.org.uk/the-gift-of-time/.

Neither of those recipes gives good quantities. The first one just says "a little sea salt", the other ones makes an approx. 0.6% salt brine. I find this a little bit low, so I'll go with a 2% brine instead.

- 400 mL water + 8 g salt (=2% brine)
- 200 g bulgure (Garant, Ekologisk bulgur)

1. Day 1 (2023-01-09): Sterilize a jar with boiling water. Let cool down. Combine bulgur and brine in a 500 mL jar, stir. Bulgur settles to the ground and top layer is starchy water. Cover with a kitchen paper and let stand at RT for 24h. Check brine level and bubbling.
2.
