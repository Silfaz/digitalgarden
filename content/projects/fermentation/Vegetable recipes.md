## Fermented daikon radish
[https://www.fermentingforfoodies.com/fermented-radishes-for-a-delicious-snack/](https://www.fermentingforfoodies.com/fermented-radishes-for-a-delicious-snack/)
- Daikon radish
- Beetroot (optional)
- 2 cups (473 mL) of water + 2 tsp (12 g) of salt = **2.5 g salt per 100 mL water**

Wash, peel and slice large daikon radish into 1 cm thick slices. Pack into a jar, together with a few slices of beetroot if you want a pink colour. NB: the beet root will make everything nicely pink, but also give everything an earthy, beety note.

Mix 2 cups of water with 2 tsp of salt. Fill up the jar with the vegetables and weigh down so the vegetables are under the liquid. With a loose lid, keep at RT for 3-5 days and observe fermentation. Taste regularly. When sour enough, store in the fridge.

## Japanese pickled cucumbers
[https://okonomikitchen.com/japanese-pickled-cucumbers/](https://okonomikitchen.com/japanese-pickled-cucumbers/), adapted

_Very good and quick to make! Not fermented, but pickled. Tasty with rice or on sandwiches. Almost obscenely umami, because it contains so much soy sauce. You can also add bell pepper to the cucumber (or other similar vegetables)._

- 500g cucumber
- 1 tsp salt
- 150g soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp rice vinegar
- 40g sugar
- 30g ginger
- 1 red chili pepper

Chop cucumber into 1 cm thick slices. Mix with salt in a bowl and let sit for 30 min.

Finely slice ginger and chili. Add to soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in a saucepan. Heat up and simmer until the sugar has dissolved. Pour out the cucumber water and press a bit, then pat the slices a bit dry with a paper towel. Add to the saucepan with the soy sauce mix. Let simmer for 5 min, then let cool down. Fill into a jar and store in the fridge. Consume within approx. 10 days.

## Curtido Rojo
Shockey “Fermented vegetables”, p121

- 1/2 head of cabbage (red or green), finely sliced
- 1 beet, peeled and shredded
- 115 g green beans, sliced in 1 cm pieces
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 fresh jalapenos, seeded and minced
- 1/2 tablespoon cumin seed
- 1/2 tablespoon grated orange or lime zest
- 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes
- 1 tablespoons unrefined sea salt
- 2 bay leaves
- Optional: 1 carrot, thinly sliced
- Optional: 1 onion, thinly sliced

Massage the salt and spices into the cabbage and vegetables, like for Sauerkraut. When the brine has developed and is ready to pack, lay the bay leaves in the bottom of a approx. 2 L vessel, pack tightly.

## Beet kvass
Shockey “Fermented vegetables”, p125
- 700 g beets, peeled
- 950 mL water
- 2 teaspoons salt

Chop the beets into 1 cm pieces and but them in a 2 L vessel. Add water to fill and mix in the salt. Cover loosely. Set aside on a baking sheet to ferment, out of direct sunlight, in a cool spot for 5-7 days, stirring daily.

Start tasting the liquid on day 5. If you want something more like a vinegar, ferment for 1 week longer.


## Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon
Shockey, “Fermented vegetables”, p150

_Made 2022-03:_ [Fermented carrot and parsley root](projects/fermentation/fermented_carrot_parsley.md)

_Made 2022-07-25_: [Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon](projects/fermentation/vietnamese_carrot_daikon.md)

- Brine: 1/4 cup (68 g) salt, 2.2 L water (= **3 g salt per 100 mL water**) + 1/2 tablespoons sugar per L
- 450 g carrots, peeled and julienned
- 450 g daikon radish, peeled and julienned
- Optional: add a few lemon slices to the jar
- Optional: vine leaf

Add salt and sugar to water to prepare the brine.

Arrange the carrots and daikon in a jar, cover with the brine. Keep leftover brine in the fridge to fill up the jar if needed. Top off with vine leaf to keep the smaller vegetable chunks submerged.

Top with a weight to keep the vegetables down, cover loosely.

Set aside on a baking sheet to ferment, out of direct sunlight in a cool spot for 7-14 days. Top up with reserved brine if necessary.

When the brine starts to get cloudy, start tasting. They are ready when they are pleasingly sour and pickle-y tasting, without the strong acidity of vinegar.

Store in jars, with lids tightened, in the fridge. These will keep refrigerated for > 12 months.


## Hungarian celeriac kraut
Shockey, “Fermented vegetables”, p158

_Made 2022-03:_ [Hungarian celeriac kraut](projects/fermentation/Hungarian%20celeriac%20kraut.md)
- 450 g celeriac, shredded
- 2-3 Hungarian wax peppers, thinly sliced
- 1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon ground paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

In a large bowl, combine the celeriac with the salt and massage well, then taste. It should taste slightly salty without being overwhelming. Add more salt if necessary, until it’s to your liking. The celeriac will become limp and liquid may begin to pool.

Transfer a few handfuls at a time into a large jar, press down on each portion to remove air pockets. You should see some brine on top when you press. When the vessel is packed, leave a few centimers head space. Top with a weight and cover loosely.

Set aside on a baking sheet to ferment, out of direct sunlight in a cool spot for 5-10 days. Check daily to make sure the celeriac is submerged, pressing down as needed to bring the brine back to the surface.

Start tasting the kraut after 5 days. It’s ready when it’s pleasingly sour. The texture will be softer than cabbage-based kraut.

When the kraut is ready, store it in jars, with lids tightened, in the fridge. It will keep like that for >12 months.

- 500 g fresh lotus root (slices and preserved in water, salt and ascorbic acid, bought at Asian Shop Helsingborg)

## Basic chili ferment (for hot sauce)
Inspired by https://farmsteady.com/blogs/field-guide/recipe-fermented-peach-hot-sauce and Shockey "Fiery Ferments" p107

_Made 2022-08-13_: [Fermented triple chili & peach sauce](projects/fermentation/Chili%20sauce.md)

- approx. 450 g chili peppers
- 1 whole white onion
- 3 big garlic cloves
- vine leaf

Basic **3%** vegetable brine: 1000 mL water + 30 g salt 

Deseed chili peppers (wear gloves! 😬) and cut into bite-sized chunks. Peel and cut onion into rough cubes. Peel garlic cloves. 

Arrange vegetables in jar and fill up with brine until everything is covered. Top off with 1 vine leaf and weigh down so everything's submerged. Leave at room temperature for a 7-14 days. When it has a nice pickel-y taste and the liquid is cloudy, it's ready. Blend in blender to get sauce with the desired consistency. A bit of vinegar adds a nice flavour. If it's too thick, you can add a bit of water. Adjust salt to taste. Optional: mix with fruit purré or fermented fruit to get a fruitier and slightly sweet condiment.

Fill into clean bottles and keep in fridge for 2-12 months.


## Kimchi (vegan)
Recipe adapted from: https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-vegan-kimchi-recipe

_Made: 2022:_ [Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)

- 1 large Chinese cabbage
- 1 small daikon radish
- 8 spring onions
- flaky sea salt (kosher salt)
- 8 garlic cloves
- 4 cm piece of ginger
- 1/2 cup gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)
- 2 Tbsp miso paste (white or red)
- 1 Tbsp sugar

1. Wash cabbage, then remove trunk and cut the leaves into rough pieces (approx. 3x3 cm).
2. Wash the daikon and cut into little sticks. 
3. Wash the spring onions, chop roughly and set aside. 
4. Place cabbage leaves, daikon and green parts of the spring onions into a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp flaky sea salt. Toss to combine and work in a bit with your hands. Cover with a plate or tea towel, then let sit at room temperature until cabbage is wilted (min. 1h, better up to 12h). The cabbage will release some liquid. 
5. Combine white parts of spring onion, minced garlic, finely chopped ginger, chili flakes, miso paste and sugar in a blender or food processor. Start pulsing to combine everything. Slowly add water to get to the right pasty consistency for it to blend properly (approx. 1 cup). Blend this past about 30 sec, scraping down the sides to not have too big chunks. 
6. Add the chili paste to the wilted cabbage and mix well with a spoon. 
7. Prepare glass jars by pouring boiling water into them and leaving to soak for a bit. Empty the jars and let cool down. 
8. Fill the cabbage-chili mixture into the jars, pressing down firmly with a spoon or chop stick to pack it tightly and not leave any air pockets. Make sure the top is covered with some of the liquid. 
9. Close jars and leave at room temperature for 24h. Then transfer to fridge and allow to ferment for at least 3 weeks before eating.  

It will not develop much CO2, so it's actually ok to close the jar tightly. I still air it from time to time during the first days and weeks, when I think about it. 

It will last forever in the fridge and just get more sour and softer.
