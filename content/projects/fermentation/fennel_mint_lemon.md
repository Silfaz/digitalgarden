_2022-07-25:_

- 2 days: No cloudiness yet. Fennel tastes crunchy and slightly salty, not sour at all.
- 5 days: Some cloudiness on top (but not very dense). Fennel soften up a bit and starts to get a bit sour/bitter. Leave a few more days.
- 7 days: Bit more sour than on day 5. Bubbly when stirred. **Harvest**.

_Conclusion_: Pleasant sourness, but also a slightly bitterness. Could it come from the lemon? (The [Vietnamese carrot & daikon](projects/fermentation/vietnamese_carrot_daikon.md) also tasted slightly bitter and also had lemon slices). 

Anise taste is quite present, much more than in the fresh fennel, and has an almost tongue-numbing quality to it. Let's see how it develops after a few days in the fridge. Will need to be added quite sparingly to a dish, and not compete with too many other flavours. Maybe just with bread and sausage, for example? Fennel pieces are crunchy, but also got soft, bit chewy. Neither lemon nor mint seemed to have had much impact on taste (uness the bitterness comes from the lemon, in which case it had a negative impact).

After 2 weeks in the fridge, the anise taste has mellowed out a bit and the acidity has increased nicely. **7 days was a good time to get it nicely sour, but still keep crunchiness**.
