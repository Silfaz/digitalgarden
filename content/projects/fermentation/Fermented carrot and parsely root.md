Recipe: [[Vegetable recipes#Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon]]

_2022-03:_
Made with **parsley root** instead of daikon. 
Tastes really nice and no problems with fungi or yeasts during incubation. Parsley root got an **interesting meaty-crunchy-chewy texture**. Has a strong parsley-root taste, so takes over the flavour a bit, but pleasant. 
Next time, ==cut bigger chunks==, itâ€™s more satisfying to eat and more useable as a pickled side dish.
Very good with rice, tofu and laoganma oil.
