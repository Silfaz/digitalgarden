title: Kombucha - 2nd fermentation experiments
---

Start with [Kombucha (base recipe)](projects/fermentation/Kombucha%20(base%20recipe).md)

Flavouring ideas:
- Fresh hops (only use a little!)
- Ginger (and turmeric)
- Mango, peach and mint
- Juniperberry + lemin (= gin-style kombucha)
- Carrot + apple (+ clove and cinnamon if more Christmas-y flavour)
- Hibiscus + lemon

Different teas ideas:
- Rooibos tea
- Mint tea
- Camomile tea
- Fruit tea

## Tips for 2nd fermentation
- Sugar is necessary ->  the more sugar the quicker the fermentation and carbonation. If base kombucha is not very sweet, add some sugar for the 2nd fermentation. 
- Adding fruits results in more carbonation than just adding aromatics. The sweeter the freuit, the faster the carbonation.
- Adding fruit puree results in more carbonation than adding big chunks of fruit (because more accessible sugars for microbes).
- Mix the big batch of F1 kombucha before taking some for 2nd fermentation to distribute the microbes well.
- Don't forget to remove the SCOBY and some extra F1 kombucha for the next batch!

## Flavouring experiments

### 2024-01-28
Base kombucha: green tea, 14 days old
Good balance between sweet and acidic. 

Plain 1:
- Just 14 day old F1 kombucha

Carrot 1: 
- 563 g F1 + 121 g Brämhults nypressad 100% morot juice = 648 g --> fits exactly in 2 Roots of Malmö bottles (á 330 mL). 
- Carrot 1 = just carrot juice
- Carrot 1 + cloves = same as above, but add 1 clove to the bottle

Blueberry 1:
- ICA ekologiska blåbär
- 1 bottle (330 mL) + 30 frozen blueberries
