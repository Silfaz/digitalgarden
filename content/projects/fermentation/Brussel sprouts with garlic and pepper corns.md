_Tasted 2022-10-31 (5 days)__: Light cloudiness visible in the jar. Brussel sprouts are very crunchy and raw, not very sour yet. Definitely need longer.

_Tasted 2022-11-06 (11 days)_: Stopped bubbling a few days ago. Now just a bit murky, but doesn't look very active. Sprouts are still crunchy. Nicely sour and a distinct pickled giant capers taste. I'll leave it a bit longer to see if the taste gets more complex and the sprouts a tiny bit softer.

_Harvested 2022-11-08 (13 days)_: Still have nice shape and light green colour. Place in fridge.

_Conclusion:_ Taste is delicious, especially after a few days/weeks in the fridge. The sprouts are crunchy, sour, slightly cabbagy and very slightly spicy from the green chilies. Maybe only cutting them in half resulted in too large pieces - next time try quarters. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe above, but cut the sprouts into quarters and put them into three jars:
- + peppercorns and green chilies
- + Nigella seeds
- + pul biber (Aleppo pepper)

Fermentation time: 13 days
