Recipe: **[Brussel sprouts with garlic and pepper corns](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Brussel%20sprouts%20with%20garlic%20and%20pepper%20corns)**

Made: _2022-10-26_
Tasted 2022-10-31 (5 days): Light cloudiness visible in the jar. Brussel sprouts are very crunchy and raw, not very sour yet. Definitely need longer.
Tasted 2022-11-06 (11 days): Stopped bubbling a few days ago. Now just a bit murky, but doesn't look very active. Sprouts are still crunchy. Nicely sour and a distinct pickled giant capers taste. I'll leave it a bit longer to see if the taste gets more complex and the sprouts a tiny bit softer.
