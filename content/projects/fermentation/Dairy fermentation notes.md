## Recipes

### Kishk
https://www.196flavors.com/kishk/

Makes 400g:

-   1 cup coarse bulgur (khichin)
-   2½ cups thick yogurt (labné)
-   2 teaspoons salt

1. In a bowl, mix the yogurt and the bulgur.
2. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the mixture sit in a cool place for 8 hours, by which time the bulgur should have absorbed most of the moisture from the yogurt.
3. While adding the salt, knead the mixture then fold it and turn it several times with the hands.
4. If the dough feels too dry and is able to absorb some more moisture, add more yogurt and knead again.
5. Cover with a cloth and let ferment at room temperature for 10 days. (During these 10 days, mix the kishk daily).
6. After 24 hours, fold and turn over the mixture several times.
7. Continue to mix the mixture every day for 9 days to unify the surface and protect the kishk from mold growth.
8. At the end of these 10 days, dry the kishk by spreading it out on a baking sheet, and place it in a sunny place, in a dehydrator, under a fan, or in a hot oven at 100 F (40°C). As it dries, crumble it into small pieces.
9. Once the kishk is completely dry, use a mortar and pestle or food processor to powder it.
10. Store at room temperature, in a dry place, in a tightly closed glass jar.
