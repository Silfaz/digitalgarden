Recipe: [Rough-chopped celeriac and carrot](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Rough-chopped%20celeriac%20and%20carrot)


Made: _2022-10-26_
Tasted 2022-10-31 (5 days): both celeriac and carrot are nicely crunchy and lightly sour. Quite fresh tasting. No bitterness. I would like a bit more sourness, so leave a few days longer.
Tasted 2022-11-06 (11 days): Stopped bubbling a few days ago. Doesn't look very active and only slightly cloudy. Nicely sour, and veggies are still crunchy. Taste not very complex yet, so leave a bit longer.
