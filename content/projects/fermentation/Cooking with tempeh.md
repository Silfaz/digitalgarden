title: "Cooking with tempeh"
---

## Preparation
Instead of marinating, simmering in a mix of water, soy sauce and/or tamari infuses the tempeh with some flavour and saltiness, while also reducing bitterness. It also makes the tempeh a bit chewier (sometimes more meat-like), but also softens the tempeh. Be very gentle when the structure is loose (like with hard-skinned lentils).

- 30 mL light soy sauce
- 30 mL tamari
- 60 mL water. 

Bring to boil, simmer tempeh cubes 2 min, turn, 2 min. Take out, let rest 10 min, then fry in oil until brown.

## Marinades
### Sriracha-peanut marinade
- 50 mL lemon juice
- 50 mL tamari
- 40 mL bread syrup
- 1 Tbsp Sriracha
- 1 Tbsp peanut butter
- 1 Tbps oil

Mix the marinade. Pour over the tempeh slices (slices marinate better than a whole block), leave for up to 24h in the fridge. Then fry in oil. (Adapted from [Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey)](projects/fermentation/Miso,%20Tempeh,%20Natto%20(Shockey).md))

#### Quinoa tempeh burgers
Recreation of Noma's burger (r/fermentation) [https://imgur.com/gallery/6h3BEua](https://imgur.com/gallery/6h3BEua): Red quinoa, cooked, 1 tsp lactic acid poweder added, shaped with silicone moulds, incubated open for 48h, fried in herb butter, glazed with miso sauce after frying, then fried again briefly. Very firm and nice texture, nice fermented umami zingyness, maybe less lactic acid powder next time. Pattie holds fat well and remained bouncy.
