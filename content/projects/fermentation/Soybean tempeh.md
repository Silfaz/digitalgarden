`Cupboard-incubated: Didn't grow as fast in the beginning as the waterbath-incubated one, but caught up in the end. Very homogeneous growth, very nice dense block. Passive warming, not as controlled. `

`Waterbath-incubated: Grew faster. Fluffy top, very nice dense block. Don't use nonstick pan, the tempeh took off the coating! Use stainless steel next time! Immersion sous vide was quite loud, esp. over night.`
