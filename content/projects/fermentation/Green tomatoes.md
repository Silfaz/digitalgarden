### Result
Nice acidity, but the skin is quite tough and I don't love the overall texture. The chili gives it a bit of subtle heat, but also contributes a strange "sweet" fermentation flavour. It got a lot of kahm yeast during fermentation, probably also due to the chili. 

Maybe best to chop the tomatoes and make it into some kind of pico de gallo or salsa. They are a bit too tough/chewy to eat on their own.
