# Miso

## Miso with koji from Max - 2024
Got 100 g of rice koji gifted from Max in July 2023. Kept in plastic bag at room temperature for 1 year before use, so not sure if still active. 

Tips about use _(from Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey)_:
Dehydrated koji can be stored in dark, dry spot for 6 months in the fridge or up to 1 year in the freezer. The longer you keep it, the less potent it will become. When ready to use, grind it up in a food processor with a lid on. Let the fine particles settle for about an hour before opening the lid (and wear a dust mask).

Tips from _Fermentationculture.eu_: 500 g dried koji rice, grind in mixer to powder. Add 200g water and mix to reconstitute = 700g fresh koji.

--> 500 g dried koji rice + 200 g water, i.e. 100 g dried koji rice + 40 g water. 
Total weight of reconstituted koji: 140 g. Probably less active (because old), so let's say it's like 100 g fresh koji. 

### Recipe
[Medium miso (1:1 koji and soybean)](projects/fermentation/Koji%20recipes.md#Medium%20miso%20(1%201%20koji%20and%20soybean) recipe for 100 g koji:
Same amount of dry legumes and fresh koji, 12% salt of total weight. 
**100 g fresh koji, 100 g dry legumes, 24 g salt**. + 1 tsp unpasteurized miso.

### Process
See _Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey) Barley Miso_, p265.
_Made in July 2024._
1. Soak beans for 8-24h. 
2. Boil soybeans in plenty of water until they are soft, about 1h. Drain, keep the bean cooking water, spread beans out on a try to cool slightly and steam off moisture. 
3. Blend dried koji in blender to powder, add 40 g water to make reconstitute.
4. When the beans are cooled below 38C, combine in a bowl with the koji and the salt. Mash together with a potato masher. Add the miso, mix. Add enough bean cooking water to achieve the desired consistency - chunky and dryish, like mashed potatoes. 
5. Use the rest of the bean cooking water to rinse out fermentation vessel, then sprinkle some salt into the jar. 
6. Layer the miso paste into the jar, press together to minimise air pockets. 
7. Set a piece of parchment paper on top, sprinkle some salt on the edges, weigh down with weight. 
8. Cover the entire vessel with cloth or paper, secure it in place, place in a tray, and store at room temperature for 6 months to 2 years. Check the tamari on top of the miso regularly during the first few weeks of fermentation. After fermentation, transfer the finished miso to the fridge.
