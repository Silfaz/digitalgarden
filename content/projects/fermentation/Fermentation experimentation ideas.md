## Ideas
- Take close-up pictures of ferments: macro lense (or microscope)
- Follow pH over time: simple pH indicator paper to start with
- Follow populations of microbial species in ferments over time. How much does a metagenomic analysis cost? Analyse with bioinformatics packages



## Want to try
- Misozuke - miso-fermented tofu "cheese": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7bwE7bNlss
- Fermented tofu (in brine)
- Fermented watermelon rinds: _started 2023-07-16_: [Water melon rinds](projects/fermentation/Water%20melon%20rinds.md)
- [Kishk](projects/fermentation/Dairy%20fermentation%20notes.md#Kishk) or poor-man's cheese (from bulgur): _started 2023-01-09_: [Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)](projects/fermentation/Keckek%20el%20Fouqara%20(Poor%20man's%20cheese).md) Another try, following https://www.instagram.com/p/C3m6fUWuP7_/
- Sauerkrauts with nice additions: carrots, peppers, celeriac, apple. 
- Less spicy kimchi with Chinese cabbage and carrot. Like the one they serve in Mai Bento in Mitt MÃ¶llan. Can basically be eaten like a crunchy, sour and slightly spicy salad.
- Hot sauce with mango and/or pineapple
- Rye sourdough


## Inspiration

### Philly Tempeh
[https://www.instagram.com/phillytempeh/](https://www.instagram.com/phillytempeh/)

Handmade, non-GMO, non-soy tempeh. They do different varieties, e.g. split pea, split pea + sunflower, chickpea + red quinoa, chickpea, adzuki beans, etc. The incubation happens on shelves in plastic bags and they seem to use some kind of incubation/insulation tent for that. Starter is from Indonesia, I think Raprima. They also ordered a dehuller through Raprima. They call their tempeh "unprocessed plant protein" to distinguish it from the many other veggie fake meat options.

### Mimiferments

Berlin-based, focussed on Koji things (shoyu, miso, amazake, shio koji, etc.). Very nice design.
