## Quinoa tempeh 
### Noma's quinoa tempeh burger
[https://medium.com/tenderlymag/inside-the-creation-of-nomas-new-vegan-quinoa-tempeh-burger-870263ceac](https://medium.com/tenderlymag/inside-the-creation-of-nomas-new-vegan-quinoa-tempeh-burger-870263ceac): _R. oligosporus_, add lactic acid powder to neutralise the proteases and ammonia funk (or maybe just let ferment for shorter?), let incubate open instead of wrapped to get less moisture so it fries better, infuse with yeast garum (or miso/marmite/etc.).

### Recreation of Noma's burger (r/fermentation)
[https://imgur.com/gallery/6h3BEua](https://imgur.com/gallery/6h3BEua): Red quinoa, cooked, 1 tsp lactic acid poweder added, shaped with silicone moulds, incubated open for 48h, fried in herb butter, glazed with miso sauce after frying, then fried again briefly. Very firm and nice texture, nice fermented umami zingyness, maybe less lactic acid powder next time. Pattie holds fat well and remained bouncy.

### From instructables
[https://www.instructables.com/Quinoa-Tempeh/](https://www.instructables.com/Quinoa-Tempeh/): 1 cup rinsed quinoa, 2 cups of water, cook for 10 min. Then proceed with normal tempeh making.

## Flavourings and additions
From r/tempeh: "Red lentils and black beans have been a big hit in my house. I always season my beans during cooking by **adding salt and vegetable stock powder,** sometimes **garlic** or **oregano/thyme/rosemary**. Or adding **lemon peel, garlic and bay leave** also works really well. Don't overdo it with the salt, then it won't inhibit mycelium growth."

From [https://www.superfoodevolution.com/black-bean-tempeh.html](https://www.superfoodevolution.com/black-bean-tempeh.html): Soak 1 cup of strips of **kelp** o/n, then add to the beans after cooking.
