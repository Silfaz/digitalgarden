## Tried-and-tested kombucha recipe
-   3.3 L water
-   8 bags of tea (black, green or a mix)
-   238 g sugar (72 g/L)
-   Scoby (can be stored in fridge for months). Cut into as many pieces as you have jars. 
-   Big enough jar(s) for the tea

1. Heat up the water to boiling. 
2. Stir in the sugar, dissolve.
3. Turn off the heat, drop in the tea bags. Put a lid on.
4. Let the tea steep for 10 min, then remove the tea bags.
5. Pour the hot tea into the jar. (That way the jars get somewhat sterilised at the same time.) Cover the jar with a lid or a layer of kitchen paper. Let the tea cool down.
6. If necessary, cut the Scoby into several pieces, so you have one for each jar. Size of the Scoby: about covering 1/3-1/2 of the surface of the jar.
7. When the tea has reached approximately room temperature, drop in the Scoby. It might sink to the bottom or float immediately.
8. Put a piece of clean cloth or kitchen paper over the opening, held in place by a rubber band.
9. Place jar somewhere at room temperature (20ish ÂºC), out of direct sunlight and strong temperature fluctuations. 
10. Taste regularly. After about 3 weeks, I like it best. 
11. Pour into bottles and store in fridge. 
12. _Optional:_ Put fruit juice or whole fruits into the bottles for a second fermentation (either slowly in the fridge or a few days at room temperature).
