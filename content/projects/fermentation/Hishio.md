140 g of dry brown lentils. Scale [Hishio](projects/fermentation/Koji%20recipes.md#Hishio%20moromi) recipe to 140 g.
- 140 g dry brown lentils
- 611 g barley koji
- 205 g diced vegetables (carrots, kålrot)
- 548 mL soy sauce

1. Without soaking, cook brown lentils in boiling water for 15 min so they are edible, but still hold their shape.

### Taste
It tastes VERY salty. The barley koji has kept its shape visually, but disintegrates quickly into the mouth - it's very soft and mushy. Bit unpleasant sensation on its own. 
The lentils on the other hand are perfect; still nicely firm and distinct in the mouth. The little carrot cubes are still crunchy. 
The lentils and carrots taste mostly of salty soy sauce, but the koji adds a mustier fermented-umami-fruity (even cheesy?) note that contributes an additional flavour dimension. 
MUCH too salty on its own, but I'll have to try it as a condiment on rice, noodles, or in vegetables, or into the starchy or legumy components of a bowl. I like the flavour of the Hishio, but would like to "dilute" it much more with other things. 
I really like the lentils in it, so maybe I'll try adding some of the Hishio to just cooked lentils. 

Similar to [Nattoh miso](projects/fermentation/Nattoh%20miso.md), but the Hishio is more deep-umami while the Nattoh miso has a freshness and warmth from the ginger.
