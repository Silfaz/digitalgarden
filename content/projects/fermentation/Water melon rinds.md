Recipe: 
- Make a 3.5% salt brine (slightly higher than the usual 3% I use for most vegetables, since the remaining red bits on the rinds contain a bit more sugar).
- Peel water melon and remove most of the red part.
- Cut the white flesh into small 1x1 cm squares and tightly pack into a jar.
- Completely submerge the fruit pieces with a weight and cover the top with some cloth. 
- Ferment for 1-2 weeks at room temperature, check regularly for fungal growth and taste.

Made: _2023-07-16_

_2023-07-20_: Tasted after 4 days. Not very sour yet, and the brine is barely cloudy. Leave for longer. The rinds are quite tough on the outside and very tasteless on the inner part. Maybe I should've peeled more of the hard outside away?
