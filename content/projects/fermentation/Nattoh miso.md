End of incubation: 2024-10-23 (= 2 weeks)

### Taste
Very salty, and quite gingery, which gives it a very warming component. 
The dominating flavour is soy sauce, but there's a definite fermented-fruity note from the koji; umami and almost a bit alcoholic. 
The soy beans stayed semi-firm in texture, while the barley kernels held their shape visually but are VERY soft in the mouth, almost mushy. Not my favourite texture, but in combination with other things it's probably ok and maybe even provides a creaminess. 
I can imagine that it's very nice on rice, noodles and vegetables, as a condiment. Too salty and concentrated to eat on its own, but for example mixed into diced vegetables (raw, cooked or lacto-fermented) and thereby "diluted" would be quite nice. 

Similar to [Hishio](projects/fermentation/Hishio.md), but a bit brighter in taste due to the ginger.
