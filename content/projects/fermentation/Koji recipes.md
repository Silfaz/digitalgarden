# Koji recipes

## What koji needs
From [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/what-koji-needs/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/what-koji-needs/)
Temperature: ==28-36C==. At lower temperatures: more proteases, at higher temperatures: more amylases.

Relative humidity: 90% Spray with water if necessary

Substrate: rice, barley, soy, wheat etc. Substrate shouldn't be wet after cooking, but rather dry. Best is steaming (unless for shoyu, then cooking is better).

After inoculation, stir for the first time after 24h, then every 4 hours or so.

Rice koji can be ready after 40 h, barley koji can take up to 50 h. Stop before (or when) spores develop (yellow-green spots). Cool the grains in the fridge or outside in a thin layer.


## Different kojis
### Barley koji
From [https://thejapanstore.jp/blogs/column/how-to-make-barley-koji](https://thejapanstore.jp/blogs/column/how-to-make-barley-koji)

_Barley miso made with barley koji has a lighter taste than rice miso made with rice koji._

1. Wash barley → soak in water (1h) → drain water (30 min)→ steam barley wrapped in cloth (45 min)→ spread out and cool down to 40C. 
2. Sprinkle koji starter on cooked and cooled-down barley, mix well → wrap in cloth together as small as possible. 
3. Incubate (==30-35C==) for 18-20 hours, then separate the clumps that have formed. Keep for another 5-6 h, separate clumps again. Keep for another 20ish h (==total: 45ish h==)→ completion when it smells like chestnut.

## Shoyus and aminos
### Soy-wheat shoyu
From [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/):

Traditional recipe: wheat berries/matvete (from soft wheat, not durum)= whole wheat kernel with bran, germ, endosperm but without the husk + soy beans.
Variations: Use oats or barley instead of wheat, and lentils or chickpeas instead of soy beans.

#### Ratio soy:wheat (legumes:grains): 
- Traditional ==1 part dry soy, 1 part dry wheat== (by weight). 
- A bit more wheat: 1 part soaked soy, 1 part dry wheat. _The less wheat you use, the longer the sauce will have to ferment._

#### Preparation:
1. **Roast** the wheat berries in the oven until they are golden brown. Mill them in something like a coffee grinder on the coarsest setting or a food processor.
2. **Soak** soy beans over night. (Soy beans will increase 2.3X when soaked, so calculate how much dry beans to use!)
3. **Cook** soy beans for at least 40 min, until you can easily squeeze them between your fingers. Strain them and let steam a bit.
4. Mix the steamy beans with the milled wheat (so the dry wheat soaks up the excess moisture). If it seems too wet, add more wheat. If it's too dry, spray some water onto it, or add more beans (if you have). Crush some of the soy beans with your hands.

#### Inoculation:
1. Dilute the spores, so they are easier to handle, with some flour.
2. Check that **soybean/wheat mixture** has cooled down to below 40C. Spread spores over the mixture (e.g. with a tea strainer). Mix well.
3. Line a pyrex dish with damp piece of cloth. Spread your mix into the dish. Cover with another moistened cloth. Put cling film over the dish, poke some holes in.
4. Incubate (at ==30C==) and keep a close eye on the temperature inside the koji, it can overheat very easily.
5. After 24h, stir the mixture. Moisten the top cloth again if necessary. Put cling film back on and continue incubation. If koji overheats (>37C) a lot, you have to stir a lot. Spread out in a thinner layer and turn off oven!
6. After another 12h (==36h in total==) you should see a lot of growth. It shouldn't sporulate, but it's not the worst if it does a bit.

#### Fermentation:
1. Prepare a **15% brine**: 150 g of uniodised salt + 850 g of water. (You'll need about 1.65x the dry ingredients weight in brine weight).
2. Clean your fermentation vessel well and pour in the koji.
3. Pour the brine over the koji until the koji is covered. Let it soak for 1-2h. Pour some more brine until koji is covered again. Stir. You might have to add more brine over the next few days to keep the koji covered.
4. Optional: Stir in a few tea spoons of unpasteurised miso to introduce beneficial bacteria.
5. During the first ==2-3 weeks, stir daily==. A lot of gas will be produced during that time that carry up solids to the surface. Push them down again so they don't get mouldy.
6. Once your shoyu has settled down and is less active, reduce stirring to once every other day.

#### Pressing:
After ==3-12 months==, put a cheese cloth into a sieve or colander, pour the fermentation mash in, cover with a cloth and put a weight on top. Let press over night. (Or use a cider press if you have one).

#### Bottling:
1. Clean bottles well, sterilise in oven (cover with aluminium foil, keep at 160C for at least 30 min, let cool down over night). Boil bottle caps in water.
2. Heat the shoyu to 90C to kill off moulds and bacteria, but don't boil it! Pour the shoyu into the bottles and cap.


### Bread aminos
From _Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)_

#### Ingredients:
- 680 g bread
- 70 g all purpose or rice flour
- 1 g (1 tsp) koji starter
- 1.9 L water
- 100 g for a 5% salt solution or 165 g for a 8% salt solution

#### Instructions:
1. Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.
2. Toast the flour in a pan over medium heat until slightly browned (5 min). Remove and let cool, then combine with koji spores.
3. Mix koji-flour with bread cubes. Distribute very well.
4. Transfer the inoculated bread to a casserole dish, cover with cling film and poke a few holes in.
5. Set incubator to ==30C== and place the pan in there. Check the internal temperature every few hours, it ==should be 27-35C==.
6. After 20-24h, you should notice a sweet smell. Stir the bread pieces, then continue to incubate for another 20-30h.
7. When the koji is done, place everything into a glass jar. Boil the water with the salt and cool down to below 50C. Pour the brine onto the bread koji and mix thoroughly.
8. Seal the jar with a lid and let sit at warm RT (27-29C) for 24h. Stir a few times during.
9. Let mixture sit at regular RT for a week. Open the jar to release gases, stir at least once a day. After a week, the ferment should have settled down. When it's no longer active, seal the container and let it ==age at RT for at least 6 months==.
10. When you're ready to use the amino sauce, strain out the bread solids (or blend into a thicker sauce). Use the liquid for seasoning. Store in the fridge (because of low salt content).

### Oat residue aminos
Adapted from bread aminos (Shockey recipe) 
Made 2021-10-16 [[Oat residue aminos]]


#### Ingredients:
- 430 g dried oat residues (dried in oven at 50C for a day, from 1 kg fresh oat residue)
- 44 g rice flour
- 1 tsp **barley koji starter** (LUVI Ferments)
- 1.2 L water
- 63 g uniodised salt
- 1 Tbsp seed miso

#### Instructions:
1. Toast rice flour. Cool down to below 40C, then add about 1/5 of one bag of barley koji starter (whole bag is for 5 kg substrate).
2. Disinfect a big bowl with Starsan and add the dried oat residues. _It feels rubbery, but not quite damp enough, so carefully add a little bit of water. Add 70 g of water and mix thoroughly with hands. Feels like a good dampness now._
3. Mix in the flour koji starter with a tea strainer. Mix very thoroughly. _Oats feel quite dry again due to the flour, so add 100 g more water and mix._
4. Pack into a Pyrex dish lined with a damp tea towel. Cover the oats with the tea towel, stick a thermometer in and cover with cling film + holes.
5. Incubate at around ==30C== until koji has grown nicely, but not sporulated (approx. ==48h==).
6. Place oat koji into a bowl, pour the (cooled down) brine onto it and mix throughly. Place in a large glass jar and leave at RT, stir occassionally for the next 2 weeks. _Mould forms on top over and over again, which looks exactly like koji mould —> remove regularly and try to weigh down the solids to keep everything submerged (it’s hard, since the oat residue is very fine)._
7. After about 2 weeks at RT in the open glass jar, divide between small plastic tubs with screw-top lids, fill completely to the brim and seal. Now leave at RT for up to 12 months.
8. Strain away the solids and filter the liquid. Store in fridge until use. Use as flavouring agent when cooking.


## Misos
### Barley + fava miso
1. Cook fava beans until they still have a bit of bite to them. 
2. Prepare barley koji (==48ish h===). Grind up equal amounts of fava and barely koji and mix with salt (10-ish%?). Put in jar, cover and leave for 6 months.



Rice koji

From Miso, Natto, Tempeh

525 g rice

20 g rice flour

1 g (1 tsp) koji starter

Cook (steam) rice to al dente consistency, then spread out into casserole for cooling.

Toast the flour in a pan for 5 min, cool down. Add koji spores to cooled flour.

When rice is below 40C, mix koji in.

Cover dish with plastic wrap (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.

Incubate at 30C. Check internal temperature every few hours, should be 27-35C.

After 24h, sweet smell. Check temperature. Stir and break up lumps. Make furrows to dissipate heat.

After around 40 h in total, rice koji is ready.

Oat koji

From Miso, Natto, Tempeh

Like rice koji, but use 3 cups of oat groats instead. Soak groats for 6-8h, then steam until al dente.

Nice oatmeal cookie smell when done.

Barley koji

From Miso, Natto, Tempeh

More prone to overheating! Nutty chestnut aroma when done. Will look less fuzzy than rice koji.

1225 g pearled barley

35 g wheat or rice flour

2 g (2 tsp) koji starter

Soak barley 6-8 h, drain and rinse. Steam for 1.5 hours or boil for 1h. Barley is done when the kernels are soft all the way through but not mushy. Drain and spread out on a drain to cool to below 40C.

Toast the flour for 5 min, cool down.

Add koji spores to cooled flour, mix well.

Sprinkle koji flour on barley, mix very well.

Put everything into a deep dish, cover with cling film (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.

Incubate at 30C, check internal temperature every few hours (should be 27-35C).

After 24-36h, surface growth and sweet, mushroomy smell. Monitor heat closely, stir and break up lumps, make furrows to dissipate heat. Adjust moisture if needed.

After about 40 h, incubation is done.
