# Cooking tempeh
## Different Swedish legumes and grains
See [[Different legumes]] for how the tempeh was made

Preparation: Put every sample (seperately) for **10 min into boiling water** (flipping once in between). Then let dry on a rack. Then fry in oil. No salt or soy sauce added this time to keep the natural taste. `—> 10 min is probably too much. All samples got very soaked up, and it also cooks the legumes very much.`

1. **Yellow peas**: Crunchy sides are good, quite nice. Duncan found it unpleasantly starchy. They have more own taste (beany/peay, grassy) than other samples. Taste a bit more of something than e.g. the fava beans. Nice bite. Bit starchy.

2. **Gotland lentils:** Very distinct lentil taste, no chewy texture like in other samples. It's loosely packed lentils, almost no mycelium between. Starchy. `—> Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. But it's a nice addition to a too smooth tempeh!`

3. **Fava beans** Very juicy/moist. Potato-cake quality. Pretty good, nice mix between something slightly starchy and meaty. `—> Good candidate for mixing and further experiments!`

4. **Brown beans**: I don't know what happened, but they had a really unpleasant, sour taste, even though no (unpleasant) smell at all. Kind of weird. No bite. Disappointing.

5. **White quinoa**: Very juicy, but very dense. No seeds distinguishable, very homogeneous. Kind of beef-like, because it's a bit too chewy. `—> Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. Also, reducing the cooking time might give it a bit more defined texture.`

6. Control: **Toor dal**: Very chewy, surprisingly homogenous. Kind of pork-vibe.

Worst-to-best ranking:

**Brown bönor - Gotland lentils - quinoa - yellow peas - toor dal - fava beans.** `—> Definitely work on the fava beans more, try combinations with quinoa and linser to give it a bit more bite and a nicer look. Also try additions like seaweed, chili, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame), etc.`
