	- 17:00 internal temp: 36c. Mix, break apart clumps and transfer to bigger baking sheet, lined with damp kitchen towel.
- 2021-10-18 19:00, ==48h==: internal temp 38c. Strong sweet-modrig smell. Harvest.

#### Result:
29-01-2022, **3 months at RT**: Take 2 of the jars, and open. 
_Pleasant smell and taste, no mould, only little white settlement (yeast?) on the bottom._ Drain and sieve the contents with coffee filters, heat up to boiling point in a pot, then leave for 5 min. Boil a glass jar and fill the hot liquid into it. Store in fridge = 3 month sample. 
After another 3 months, I strained the liquid again through a coffee filter, since it has a cloudy/floury part that settles on the bottom that doesnâ€™t look so nice.

20-04-2022, **6 months at RT**: Harvest all jars.
_Pleasant smell, no mould but some liquid has pushed through the screwed-on lids (needs to be incubated in a tub, and not hermetically sealed!). Quite a lot of white, yeast-y looking settlement in the jars._
Drain and sieve contents, heat up to boiling point, then fill into jars. The 3 months samples have actually accumulated quite a lot of white settlement, so combine with the 6 months samples.
