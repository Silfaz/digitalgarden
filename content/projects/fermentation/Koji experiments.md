# Koji

## Keeping koji

After the koji is done, keep for:
- immediate use
- immediate refrigeration for use within the next 10 days
- immediate freezing for use within 1-2 months
- immediate drying (max. 40C) for longer-term storage of up to 1 year

# Miso

## Soybean miso with rice koji from Max - 2024
Got 100 g of rice koji gifted from Max in July 2023. Kept in plastic bag at room temperature for 1 year before use, so not sure if still active. 

Tips about use _(from Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey)_:
Dehydrated koji can be stored in dark, dry spot for 6 months in the fridge or up to 1 year in the freezer. The longer you keep it, the less potent it will become. When ready to use, grind it up in a food processor with a lid on. Let the fine particles settle for about an hour before opening the lid (and wear a dust mask).

Tips from _Fermentationculture.eu_: 500 g dried koji rice, grind in mixer to powder. Add 200g water and mix to reconstitute = 700g fresh koji.

--> 500 g dried koji rice + 200 g water, i.e. 100 g dried koji rice + 40 g water. 
Total weight of reconstituted koji: 140 g. Probably less active (because old), so let's say it's like 100 g fresh koji. 

### Recipe
[Medium miso (1:1 koji and soybean)](projects/fermentation/Koji%20recipes.md#Medium%20miso%20(1%201%20koji%20and%20soybean) recipe for 100 g koji:
Same amount of dry legumes and fresh koji, 12% salt of total weight. 
**100 g fresh (or reconsituted) koji, 100 g dry legumes, 24 g salt**. + 1 tsp unpasteurized miso.

### Process
See _Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey) Barley Miso_, p265.
_Made in October 2024._

1. Blend dried koji in blender to powder, add 40 g water to make reconstitute.
Otherwise follow recipe.
_Start of incubation: 2024-10-07_
