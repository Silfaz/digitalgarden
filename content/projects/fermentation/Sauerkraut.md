_Conclusion_: Stays very crunchy and delicious for a long time in the fridge. I love it with quite a lot of caraway seeds, so that's what I added. 

Works well as a side dish to hearty, central European dishes, but also as a topping on a sandwich. Or with yogurt, fruits and m√ºsli in the morning, like my parents eat it.
