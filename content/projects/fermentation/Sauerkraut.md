Recipe: [Mama's Sauerkraut Tupperware](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Mama's%20Sauerkraut%20Tupperware)

Needed about 3 weeks at room temperature and then a few weeks in the fridge before I liked it best. Before that it tastes good but still quite fresh/raw. 

_Conclusion_: Stays very crunchy and delicious for a long time in the fridge. Much better texture than any store-bought Sauerkraut. I love it with quite a lot of caraway seeds, so that's what I added. 

Works well as a side dish to hearty, central European dishes, but also as a topping on a sandwich. Or with yogurt, fruits and m√ºsli in the morning, like my parents eat it.
