title: "Fermented triple chili & peach sauce"
---

Plan: Make a simple chili sauce base, ferment, then mix together with the fermented peaches ([UFO_peaches](projects/fermentation/UFO_peaches.md)) to get a nice, fruity condiment.


Buy chili peppers (from Day2Day, Helsingborg, 2022-08-13): 

![](projects/attachments/IMG_20220813_171126.jpg)
8 green Jalapeno peppers (225 g, 20.25 SEK)
Taste: grassy, not very spicy

13 yellow peppers (120 g, 4.79 SEK)
fruity, quite spicy, long lingering spiciness

9 red Haparino peppers (110 g, 13.19 SEK)
very fruity, medium spicy, very cough-inducing

Recipe: [Basic chili ferment for hot sauce](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Basic%20chili%20ferment%20for%20hot%20sauce) and [UFO peaches](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#UFO%20peaches)

_I had burning hands, fingers and esp. fingertips (under the nails) for two days afterwards. Wear gloves next time!! Even though the chilies themselves don't seem so spicy initially. _
- 2 days: Cloudy and bubbly
