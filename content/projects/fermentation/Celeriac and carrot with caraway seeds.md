Made: _2022-10-26_

_Tasted 2022-10-31 (5 days)_: Both celeriac and carrot are nicely crunchy and lightly sour. Quite fresh tasting. No bitterness. I would like a bit more sourness, so leave a few days longer.

_Tasted 2022-11-06 (11 days)_: Stopped bubbling a few days ago. Doesn't look very active and only slightly cloudy. Nicely sour, and veggies are still crunchy. Taste not very complex yet, so leave a bit longer. 

_Harvested 2022-11-08 (13 days)_: Place in fridge

_Conclusion_: Very nice and fresh flavour. Crunchy. Carrot and celeriac are a good combination, and the caraway gives it a nice additional freshness.
