Recipe: [Kimchi vegan](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Kimchi%20vegan)

_2022_

_Conclusion_: I only leave it out at room temperature for 24h, then let it ferment in the fridge for a few weeks. I like it best after about 3 weeks in the fridge, when it starts to get sour and is still quite crunchy and fresh tasting. But I also love it after months, when it has got really acidic and juicy. 

Goes with everything, especially with plain rice (together with tofu cubes), as Kimchi Fried Rice, as Kimchi pancakes or as part of an Okonomiyaki, with udon noodles (and a bit of gochujang for sweetness), in a cheese toastie or on the side with almost any dish to give it a bit of crunch, spicyness, acidity and zing.

SO GOOD!!! 

And even if you're not vegetarian/vegan, I find this version with miso paste much better than any I've had with fish sauce.
