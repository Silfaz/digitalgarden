_2022-07-25:_

Bought "UFO peaches" from Hemk√∂p (grown in Spain), 29.90 SEK for 500 g. Washed and cut each into 8 chunks. 

1 day: Liquid is already cloudy, but no sour taste yet.

2 days: Cloudier. Bubbles appearing. Fruit tastes just sweet, peachy and a bit salty.

5 days: Liquid is nicely cloudy. Fruit is still sweet and peachy but has started to get a bit funky/sour taste. Leave for another day and taste again.
