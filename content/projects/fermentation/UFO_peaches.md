_2022-07-25:_

Bought "UFO peaches" from HemkÃ¶p (grown in Spain), 29.90 SEK for 500 g. Washed and cut each into 8 chunks. 

- 1 day: Liquid is already cloudy, but no sour taste yet.
- 2 days: Cloudier. Bubbles appearing. Fruit tastes just sweet, peachy and a bit salty.
- 5 days: Liquid is nicely cloudy. Fruit is still crunchy and sweet and peachy but has started to get a bit funky/sour taste. Leave for another day and taste again.
- 7 days: Banana and slightly funky smell (like when I fermented the oat residues). Some kahm yeast growth on top of liquid. Fruit pieces have got a soft exterior and a crunchy core, and a clearly fermented taste. Should've maybe harvested 1-2 days ago when the fruits were still crunchy through and through? **Harvest today!**

_Conclusion:_ Much more fermented tasting on the bottom than on the top of the jar --> maybe stir next time. Clear kombucha vibes from the ferment: fruity-sweet and punchy-fermented-sour, with a bit of saltiness. Not sure yet how I will eat it, but would probably work well as a kind of chutney or together with other pickled vegetables. 

After 1-2 weeks in the fridge, the peaches have softened even more and disintegrated a bit, but also acidity has increased. They don't taste salty any more, but more fizzy, fruity and sour. quite a lot of kahm yeast growth on the top during fridge storage, but no bad smell or taste. 

Maybe add it to fermented chili peppers to make a hot sauce? [[Fermented hot sauce]]
