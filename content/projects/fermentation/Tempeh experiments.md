### In short: What has worked best so far
#### Fermentation
For all legumes: Add **4 Tbsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) apple cider vinegar after cooking, then let dry a bit, e.g. in a 50C oven for 30 min with occasional stirring. Mix with **1 tsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) tempeh starter. Fill into plastic bags or glass dishes, nicely compact. For plastic bags, poke holes with a wooden skewer every few centimers. Cover with a clean tea towel and place in the oven onto a heating mat, place the temperature sensor into one of the cakes and set it to 30C. Close the oven door and just leave it without turning on the oven. Observe the temperature and when it goes over 32C, turn off the heating pad (for a while). If it continues to go up, remove the tea towel, or even take the cakes out of the oven. It really shouldn't be much warmer than 32C for a long time, otherwise it tastes too fermented. Ideal is **30C**. 

If it looks done after less than 24h or if it starts to get black sporulation spots, place it in the fridge for 1-2 days for slow continued growth. 

Generally, after **30-40h** the cakes are sufficiently densly permeated with mycelium to hold together when cut and marinated. Much earlier than that, and it's a crumbly bean mess that tastes more like just cooked beans than tempeh. Much longer than that and it can get very squidgy and have a very fermented, funky taste (which some people like). 

**Black beans** 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation (this definitely helps with growth!). Don't bother chopping in food processor or dehulling. Best to mix 1:1 or 3:2 with a legume with thinner skin, e.g. Toor dal.

**Toor dal** 125 g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Best to mix 1:1 or 2:3 with a legume with thicker skin, e.g. black beans, since Toor dal on its own ferments SUPER fast and often over-ferments. 

**Soy beans** 250 g, rinse and soak o/n. Try to remove as much skin as possible from the beans by pressing them through your hands. Doesn't need to be 100%, but good if about half of the beans  lose their skin. Cook for **50 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Nice on its own or mixed with other legumes.


#### Post-fermentation
When placed in the oven, it continues to ferment and change in taste and texture. So for slightly under-fermented cakes that's a good think to do for 1-2 days. For well-fermented cakes however, I wouldn't store it in the fridge without heat-treating (and inactivating, i.e. killing) the fungus. 

**Heat treatment**: Remove the tempeh cake from the plastic bag or glass dish and wrap in aluminium foil. Place in **85C oven for 30 min**, then let cool down on the counter top. After this, the tempeh is good in the fridge for about 1 week.

**Freezing**: Very conveniently, the finished cakes can just be thrown into the freezer for long-term storage and thawed whenever you want to eat it. Best is to place it in the fridge on the day before consumption and let it thaw slowly. It's also very convenient to add marinade to the frozen cake and let it marinate and thaw at the same time in the fridge over night.
