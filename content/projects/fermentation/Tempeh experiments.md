In short, what has worked best so far was:

**Black beans** 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation (this definitely helps with growth!). Don't bother chopping in food processor or dehulling.
