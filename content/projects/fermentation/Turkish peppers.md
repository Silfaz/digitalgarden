_2022-07-25:_

2 days: Liquid starts to get a hint of cloudiness. Bit of bubbling going on. Pepper tastes crunchy and slightly salty, not sour yet.

5 days: Liquid is slighlty cloudy. Pepper has lost a bit of crunch. Got a bit sourness/bitterness. Not sour enough yet, leave a few more days.

7 days: Pleasant and sour. Soft to bite, but still has a nice crunch to it. Harvest!

Conclusion: Very clean, sour taste. The only slight bitterness comes from the skin, which is also a bit touch to eat (similar to the unfermented peppers). Will work well in sandwiches and salads, as well as on the side to other dishes.
