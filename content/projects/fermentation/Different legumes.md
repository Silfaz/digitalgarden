## Different legumes
## Different Indian dals (2020-09-09)
*Test: Chana dal, Toor dal, Green mung dal*

Standard recipe (according to [[Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey)]]), adapted. 
- Material: Chana dal, Toor dal, Green mung dal from Indian shop, Herkulesgatan, Gothenburg. 125 g dry dal.
- Soak: Wash and soak in water for 10h, then change water and soak for another 12 h (not necessary, but I didn't have time to cook it earlier). **Total soaking 22h.** Green mung dal had lost all its husks and was very easy to dehull. Looks just pale yellow. Toor dal and Chana dal have increased in size quite a lot and have the consistency of raw potato.
- Cook: Chana dal and Green mung dal: **5 min**; Toor dal: **10 min**. Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. `Could use less soaking or less cooking time.` Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.
- Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix. Add 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) tempeh starter (_topcultures_). Spread in perforated plastic bags, incubate in cupboard above freezer. 
- Growth: Passive warming, not controlled. Start 09-09-2020, 12:00 (27°C).
	- Toor dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total inucubation time: **44h**.
	- Chana dal: Total incubation time (in cupboard): **44h**.
	- Green mung dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total incubation time: **48h**.

### Chana dal
Slower to colonise than the others, so left in cupboard for much longer. More and bigger holes made, because it was wet inside the plastic bag. `Needs to be dried off better!` Nice dense, fluffy mycelium, no spores. Slightly sour and damp smell.`

### Toor dal
Good colonisation, got warm quickly (32°C). At the end, a bit wet and slightly yeasty, alcoholic smell. More mycelium on the sides than in the middle, but nicely colonised through and through. Tiny spores in one corner.

### Green mung dal
Good initial colonisation, taken out after 23h at 34°C. Mycelium took longer to get dense. At the end, very strong, sharp alcoholic smell. Not well grown in the middle. No spores visible. Doesn't smell pleasant at all. `Too small grains! It gets too dense and wet. Mix with something bigger.`

## Different Swedish legumes/grains (2020-09-19)

_Test: Gula ärtor (yellow peas), Gotland linser (lentils from Gotland), Lins Anicia (lentil Anicia), Favabönor (fava beans, dehulled), bruna bönor (brown beans), vit quinoa (white quinoa), compare to Toor dal._

- Material: **Legumes** from FRAM, Gothenburg. 125 g dry legumes/grains each.
- Soaking and cooking (until al dente):
	1. Yellow peas: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. Nice texture, grassy taste. Dehulling was a pain and there were weird peas that didn't get soft (~1%).
	2. Gotland lentils: **No soaking**. Cook for **12 min**. Nicely separated. Very good, fresh, chestnutty taste.
	3. Lentil Anicia: **No soaking**. Cook for **5 min**. Slightly tougher than Gotland linser, but also pleasant nutty taste.
	4. Fava beans: **Soak over night**, cook for **5 min**. Starchy, not a strong bean taste.
	5. Brown beans: **Soak over night**, dehull, boil for **18 min** `—> much too long! Very mushy!` Starchy, clean taste. Dehulling was a pain, quite tough shell.
	6. White quinoa: **No soaking**. Rinse very thoroughly and cook for **9 min** in a lot of water. Fluffy and nice pop, slightly bitter, earthy taste, very voluminous.
	7. Toor dal: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. 

- Inoculation: Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and heat up in dry pan to remove moisture. Spread on clean tea towel and let dry a bit. Mix in a tub thoroughly with 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) starter (_topcultures_). 
- Growth: 
	- Open: Prepare 7 portions in plastic or glass jars for open incubation in sous vide immersion water bath, set to **32°C** water temperature (="open"). Incubation start, 19-09-2020, 21:00. Sous vide immersion cooker is very loud, but temperature in water bath was very even. Water bath shut off 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**
	- Plastic: Prepare 7 bigger portions in perforated plastic bags for incubation above freezer (27°C at the start) (="plastic"). In the cupboard the temperature was varied, but once the mycelium started to take over it got VERY warm in some samples (35-43°C!!). Bags put at room temperature 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**

Results:
1. **Yellow peas**: Smell is quite mild, slightly mushroomy. Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans `—> maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?` Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.

2. **Gotland lentils**: Open: Very fluffy on the top and a tiny bit sporulation. Black colour is visible underneath, but that's from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling `—> mix lentils with something else!` Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.

3. **Lentils Anicia**: Didn't develop mycelium at all, neither in bag nor in cup, and also not after > 48h incubation. Discarded. `—> Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?`

4. **Fava beans**: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy `—> dry the beans better next time and cook less!` Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets `—> press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.` Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.

5. **Brown beans**: Plastic: Nice very white, dense block. Slight ammonia smell! Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.

6. **White quinoa**: Got the hottest and developed mycelium the fastest. The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It's sticky and slimy —> remove! `—> Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.` The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top `—> incubate for a shorter time!` Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag `—> Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.`

7. **Toor dal**: Plastic. Very nice dense cake with thick, smooth, white mycelium all around. Open: Fluffy top with slight sporulation, otherwise similar density to plastic. Both: Smells of almost nothing, very mild. Nice mycelium throughout, no wet or non-grown spots. Perfect tempeh.
