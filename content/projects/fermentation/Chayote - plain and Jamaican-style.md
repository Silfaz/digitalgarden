Recipe: Adapted from https://healthiersteps.com/recipe/vinegar-free-jamaican-pickle/

### Plain
Make a 500 mL of a 3% brine. Squeeze in the juice of one lime. Peel 1 carrot and cut into thin slices. Peel 1 chayote, discard seeds and pit, cut in thin slices. Place into jar. 

### Jamaican-style
Make 500 mL of a 3% brine. Squeeze in the juice of one lime. Peel 1 carrot and cut into thin lices. Peel 1 chayote, discard seeds and pit, cut in thin slices. Peel 1 onion and cut into slices. Place into jar with 10 pimento (allspice) berries. 

Made: _2023-07-06_ (Jamaican-style)

_2023-07-10_: After a few days there was some Kahm yeast growth, and some specks of fungus - probably Aspergillus - on the top. Scooped it off and discarded the top layer of vegetables. It was probably because some vegetable pieces were not fully submerged. Continued fermentation at room temperature for a few more days.

_2023-07-13_: Put into fridge after 1 week of fermentation. Acidity is quite gently and fresh, chayote and carrot pieces are nicely crunchy with a nice texture difference (carrot is more dense and dry, chayote has the texture of a kohlrabi). No more yeast or fungal growth visible. No off-flavours. The background taste of onion is quite strong, while the allspice is not noticeable. Next time I would reduce the amount of onion added, or maybe leave it out completely, as it's a bit dominating.
