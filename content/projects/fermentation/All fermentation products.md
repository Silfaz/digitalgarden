## Starch & Grains
- **Fermented brown rice drink** from Thailand http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104710 Species: _Lactobacillus plantarum_ B7
- **uji**: Fermented grain porridge
- **Sowans**: Creamy lacto-fermented oats porridge, Scottish traditional food. 
	- > Once the oats were dried and ground, crofters and others having given the oats to the mill would get back not only the ground oats but also a bag of “sids”. These would be the oat husks (I guess we’d call this oat bran today) with little bits of the kernel still attached to them. Not wanting this to go to waste people would make Sowans  out of them. A thick oat meal paste with a distinctly sour taste a bit like milk kefir. https://cailleachs-herbarium.com/2018/03/sowens-fermented-oats-scottish-traditional-food-recipe/
	- 2/3 oat bran + 1/3 oat flakes + warm water in a jar + 1 tsp salt. Mix, press the solids below liquid, leave fermenting at RT for 4-7 days. Strain out the oats, leave the liquid to settle into **swats** (top, clear yellow) and **sowans** (bottom, white paste). Swats can be drunk as a  probiotic liquid, the sowans can be cooked into a paste/porridge or added to baking, e.g. scones. https://cailleachs-herbarium.com/2018/03/sowens-fermented-oats-scottish-traditional-food-recipe/
- **Swats**: Probiotic oat drink, produced when making sowans.
- **Boza**: (also bosa) Fermented grain drink (wheat, millet, barley, maize) from Middle East, Caucasus, Western Asia, Northern Africa. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boza. Thick consistency, low (1%) alcoholic content, slightly acidic, sweet flavour. Zorba, Murat; Hancioglu, Omre; Genc, Mahmut; Karapinar, Mehmet; Ova, Gulden (2003). "The use of starter cultures in the fermentation of boza, a traditional Turkish beverage". _Process Biochemistry_. **38** (10): 1405–1411. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.1016/S0032-9592(03)00033-5](https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0032-9592%2803%2900033-5).
- Dolo: Fermented African beverage from Burkina Faso. Species _Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. jakobsenii_ was isolated from dolo. 

- ### Kishk
	- Also called **kishuk**, **keshkeh**, **kichk**, **jameed**, **tarhana**, **qurut**, or **shilanch**.
	- Wheat bulgur fermented with water and salt. Often combined also with yogurt to make labneh-like balls, stored in olive oil. Or dried and milled to later add to dishes (similar to grated parmesan). Apparently tastes similar to feta.
	- Try out a vegan variety (only bulgur and salt): https://365daysoflebanon.com/2016/01/09/the-poor-mans-cheese/. Version with yogurt (labneh): https://www.196flavors.com/kishk/. Mixture of [labneh](https://www.196flavors.com/iraq-labneh/) and bulgur (wheat) that is fermented for ten days, sun-dried (traditionally), and then powdered. The mixture is salted and thoroughly kneaded every day to prevent the formation of molds. Fermented moist kishk obtained after eleven days is known as _kishk akhdar_ or fresh kishk. Then, it is made into balls and preserved in olive oil, or is left to sun-dry to obtain a dry powder.
