### Kishk (kushuk, keshkeh, kichk)
Also called jameed, tarhana, qurut, or shilanch.
Wheat bulgur fermented with water and salt. Often combined also with yogurt to make labneh-like balls, stored in olive oil. Or dried and milled to later add to dishes (similar to grated parmesan). Apparently tastes similar to feta.

https://www.196flavors.com/kishk/
Mixture of [labneh](https://www.196flavors.com/iraq-labneh/) and bulgur (wheat) that is fermented for ten days, sun-dried (traditionally), and then powdered. The mixture is salted and thoroughly kneaded every day to prevent the formation of molds. Fermented moist kishk obtained after eleven days is known as _kishk akhdar_ or fresh kishk. Then, it is made into balls and preserved in olive oil, or is left to sun-dry to obtain a dry powder.
