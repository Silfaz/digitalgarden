_2022-03_:
Nice mild heat from the peppers, and the fermented celeriac gets a nice sharp-acidic flavour that goes well with the celeria taste. The caraway is nice to give it the feeling of a complete dish.
Goes surprisingly nice with rice, esp. when mixed in. Good with tofu and laoganma.
Next time, ==shred the celeria much coarser==. I shredded it waaay too finely (in the food proessor - big mistake). Would be more satisfying to eat if it was bigger chunks.
