Recipe: [Vegetable recipes - Dill pickles](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Dill%20pickles)

_2022-04-20:_

Not as acidic and sweet as smörgåsgurkar, but still nice flavour. More complex and earthy. The dill definitely comes through. 

In the beginning (after a few days fermentation at RT and then 1-2 weeks in the fridge) the inside of the cucumbers was still light green and they tasted quite fresh. 

After 1 month in the fridge the liquid has penetrated the whole cucumber and they taste really nice. To stay crunchy, I added 2 bay leaves to the brine during fermentation, which seems to have worked well.

After 4 months in the fridge, the cucuber started to get quite soft. Still delicious, but crunch is missing. So next time, **consume within 3 months**.
