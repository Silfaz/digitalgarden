Not as acidic and sweet as smörgåsgurkar, but still nice flavour. More complex and earthy. The dill definitely comes through. In the beginning (after a few days fermentation at RT and then 1-2 weeks in the fridge) the inside of the cucumbers was still light green and they tasted quite fresh. But after 1 month in the fridge the liquid has penetrated the whole cucumber and they taste really nice. To stay crunchy, I added 2 bay leaves to the brine during fermentation, which seems to have worked.
