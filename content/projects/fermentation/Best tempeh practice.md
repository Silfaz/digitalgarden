## Choice of legumes/grains
- "Tough" lentils (e.g. Gotland lentils) don't make a good cake on their own, but are a good addition to other legumes that would give a too soft cake.
- Fava beans give a starchy/meaty texture. Would benefit from mixing with something tougher (e.g. Gotland lentils).
- Quinoa gives a very dense and chewy texture. Grows VERY quickly and overheats very easily! 
- Toor dal can get quite chewy and meat-like, especially when it's boiled and fried after fermentation. 

## Fermentation
- Rather slightly too cold (29 ºC) than too warm (>35 ºC). 
- It's good to test a new batch of starter culture first, to see how active it is. But generally using a bit less starter and incubating for longer at not too high temperature gives the best tempeh. Adding a lot of starter culture results in too rapid fermentation --> too much heat development --> overripe (ammonia) taste and black sporulation spots.
- Adding salt to the bean cooking water improves the taste only a tiny bit, but it's not worth it to lose fungus viability. Better simmer in soy-water afterwards, or marinate. 
- Good sized bags are e.g. Zip bag 16x12cm, PE-LD (ordered from Fyndiq). Fill with about 200-250 g of cooked beans for nice-sized block. Not more, otherwise it gets too thick and develops too much internal heat during mycelium growth.


## Cooking
- When boiling in salt water, **boil for (a lot) less than 10 min**, otherwise it gets too soggy and the legumes get too cooked.

## Storing
- Do not store for more than 2 days in the fridge without prior heat treatment (see below)! It continues fermenting and will start to taste very funky.

## What has worked best so far
### Fermentation
For all legumes: 
- Add **4 Tbsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) apple cider vinegar after cooking, then let dry a bit, e.g. in a **50C** oven for **30-60 min** with occasional stirring. 
- Mix with **1-2tsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) tempeh starter. 
- Fill into plastic bags or glass dishes, nicely compact. For plastic bags, poke holes with a wooden skewer every few centimers. 
- Cover with a clean tea towel and place in the oven onto a heating mat, place the temperature sensor into one of the cakes and set it to 30C. Close the oven door and just leave it without turning on the oven. Observe the temperature and when it goes over 32C, turn off the heating pad (for a while). If it continues to go up, remove the tea towel, or even take the cakes out of the oven. It really shouldn't be much warmer than 32C for a long time, otherwise it tastes too fermented. Ideal is **30C**. 
- If it looks done after less than 24h or if it starts to get black sporulation spots, place it in the fridge for 1-2 days for slow continued growth. 

Generally, after **30-40h** the cakes are sufficiently densly permeated with mycelium to hold together when cut and marinated. Much earlier than that, and it's a crumbly bean mess that tastes more like just cooked beans than tempeh. Much longer than that and it can get very squidgy and have a very fermented, funky taste (which some people like, but I don't). 

### Soy beans
250 g, rinse and soak o/n. Try to remove as much skin as possible from the beans by pressing them through your hands. Doesn't need to be 100%, but good if about half of the beans  lose their skin. Cook for **50 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Nice on its own or mixed with other legumes. Increase in weight about 2X during cooking.

### Black beans
250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation (this definitely helps with growth!). Don't bother chopping in food processor or dehulling. Best to mix 1:1 or 3:2 with a legume with thinner skin, e.g. Toor dal. Increase in weight about 1.8X during cooking.

### Toor dal
125 g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Best to mix 1:1 or 2:3 with a legume with thicker skin, e.g. black beans, since Toor dal on its own ferments SUPER fast and often over-ferments. 

### Grey peas
Did not work at all [Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Fava%20beans%20with%20salt,%20grey%20peas%20(2020-11-24)), they have a too tough skin. Need to be dehulled and/or split. 

### Fava beans
Soak o/n, cook for **2.5 min**. Nice, slightly chewy tempeh [Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Fava%20beans%20with%20salt,%20grey%20peas%20(2020-11-24))]. Need VERY little cooking. Increase in weight about 1.7X during cooking.

### Adzuki beans
Soak o/n, cook for **8 min** without dehulling. Lose most of the pretty red colour during cooking. Increase in weight about 1.8X during cooking. Does not work well on its own (doesn't stick together). Needs some softer legume mixed in (e.g. Toor dal, Fava bean, soy bean). 



### Post-fermentation
When placed in the oven, it continues to ferment and change in taste and texture. So for slightly under-fermented cakes that's a good think to do for 1-2 days. For well-fermented cakes however, I wouldn't store it in the fridge without heat-treating (and inactivating, i.e. killing) the fungus. 

#### Heat treatment
Remove the tempeh cake from the plastic bag or glass dish and wrap in aluminium foil. Place in **85°C oven for 30 min**, then let cool down on the counter top. After this, the tempeh is good in the fridge for about 1-2 weeks.

Also possible (if right plastic bags are chosen) to heat-treat in the bag. E.g. LD-PE has a melting point of >105°C. Wrap in aluminium foil (to prevent loss of moisture) and leave in **85°C oven for 45-60 min**. The tempeh block shrinks a bit inside the plastic bag.

#### Freezing
Very conveniently, the finished cakes can just be thrown into the freezer for long-term storage and thawed whenever you want to eat it. Best is to place it in the fridge on the day before consumption and let it thaw slowly. It's also very convenient to add marinade to the frozen cake and let it marinate and thaw at the same time in the fridge over night. 


## Gifting tempeh
A nice way to give tempeh blocks to other people is to wrap them into baking paper or sandwich paper as an outer layer (blocks still inside the plastic bag).
