## Choice of legumes/grains
- "Tough" lentils (e.g. Gotland lentils) don't make a good cake on their own, but are a good addition to other legumes that would give a too soft cake.
- Fava beans give a starchy/meaty texture. Would benefit from mixing with something tougher (e.g. Gotland lentils).
- Quinoa gives a very dense and chewy texture. Grows very quickly and overheats very easily! 

## Cooking
- When boiling in salt water, **boil for (a lot) less than 10 min**, otherwise it gets too soggy and the legumes get too cooked.
