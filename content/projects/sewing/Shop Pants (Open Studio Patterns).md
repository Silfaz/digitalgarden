Great pair of trousers with a relaxed fit and interesting geometic pocket details. Very deep pockets! Very satisfying make because the instructions and the sew-along video are both excellent, and the pattern fits together very well. 
## Pattern
Open Studio Patterns, size 2.
### Instruction & Inspo
[Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md)

## Fabric
Dark-blue twill

## Adjustments
Straightened and lengthened the bottom parts of the legs a bit to make them less barrel-shaped. I also made the back pockets a bit smaller.

## Next time
Perhaps a size smaller, they are quite loose around the waist and butt. And in a sturdier fabric, the twill I chose is slightly too lightweight and gets a bit deformed after wearing the trousers for a few days.
