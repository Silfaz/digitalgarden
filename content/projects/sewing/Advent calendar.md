title: Advent calendar
---
_Made: November 2024_

Very simple. Cut out 25 uniform rectangles from cotton and viscose fabric scraps, overlocked the edges, then sewed them together, creating a tunnel at the top. Then funnelled a velvet cord through and voil√°, the advent calendar was finished. 
I filled the bags with various sweets and strung them up on a nice ribbon. Didn't bother with labelling the bags, I trust Duncan to be able to open one bag every day during December.
