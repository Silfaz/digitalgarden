## Pattern
French Navy Now
Size C (small). 
## Fabric
Quite thick and stretchy beige jersey fabric from Kattun Stoffe. Bit too thick and bouncy for my taste, would like a slightly slinkier jersery next time. 

## Adjustments
1. No adjustments. The curved hem is not necessary for me, it's a bit faffy and I tuck the t-shirt in most of the time anyway. The neckband turned out to be a bit short, so the neckline got a bit "ruffled". 
2. Lengthened the body a bit and didn't do the round hem. Made the neckband a bit longer.

## Next time
