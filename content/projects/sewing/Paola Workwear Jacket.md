### Lining
From https://fabrics-store.com/jackets/paola-workwear-jacket-pattern-type-pdf: I drafted the lining pieces by: -Removing the front and neck facing from the front and back pattern pieces - Adding 1/4" up and out from each armhole point. This allows the sleeve lining a bit more room to move in there, and removes any tightness. - Added 1" to the center back to form a pleat to allow plenty of moving room, and again avoid any tightness. Instead of 'bagging' my lining, I serged all the edges, and basted it at the side seams, shoulders and fronts, and spent a lovely time hand stitching it in place with an invisible stitch while listening to some podcasts. I love doing these little hand stitched finishes. The basting stitches just held everything in place so it didn't shift around while I was hand sewing. They got removed after everything was secured.
