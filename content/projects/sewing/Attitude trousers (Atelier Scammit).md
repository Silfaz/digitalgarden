_Here with self-drafted t-shirt._
## Pattern
Atelier Scammit.
Size 40. 

## Fabric
Slightly stretchy twill, dark grey, from a fabric shop in Lund. 
Should've made a size 38 in hindsight, because it turned out quite roomy, especially in the bum area. 

## Adjustments
Would like to take in the trouser legs by 1 cm on each side, and the waist by 1.5 cm on each side (3 cm in total). This would require some adjustments of the waistband though.
