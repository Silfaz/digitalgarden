Nice pattern with a fancy, but slightly fiddly hidden button plaquet. Nice rounded collar or mandarin-style collar. 

## Pattern
Named Clothing, size 38.

## Fabric
1. Blouse: Wearable toile from an old bedsheet with Gothenburg-themed print: seagulls, oyster catchers, boats, rocks, seals, waves. 
2. Viscose (?) from Komolka, Vienna. 

## Adjustments

## Next time
Size 38 is quite roomy, but perhaps 36 would be too tight? 
I didn't do the trench-style cuffs, but the sleeves look a bit "self-made" without any decoration. Could make them nice next time, either a slightly broader cuff or elastic? 
Definitely hand-sew the rounded collar next time, it turned out quite angular with the sewing machine.

Slightly wonky collar, and button stand with hidden plaquet:
