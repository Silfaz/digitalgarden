_Here with [Self-drafted long summer skirt](projects/sewing/Self-drafted%20long%20summer%20skirt.md)._

Very cool summer top, quite unusual cut. I love the sleeves with the elastic. Quite loose cut, so combine with tight trousers or tuck in. 
## Pattern
Fibre Mood.

## Fabric
100% cotton, mustard yellow and mint green pattern. From Skroten in Kinna.
The fabric is quite stiff, which makes the blouse even more fashion-y. 
## Adjustments
I made a toile and adjusted the pattern to make the neckline less wide. I also lengthened the sleeves slightly.
