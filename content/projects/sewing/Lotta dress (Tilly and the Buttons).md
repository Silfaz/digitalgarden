title: "Lotta dress"

Pattern: Tilly and the Buttons, size 4

Fabric: 100% Lenzing Ecovero Viscose from Kattun Stoffe, Floral shade bottle green, 165 g/m2, 1.45 m width. Suggested length: 2.5 m, actual needed: 2 m (since skirt part was cut against the grain). 

Adjustments: Short sleeves, cut length to just above knee, a bit less volume (i.e. width) in the skirt section. Added deep side pockets (cut in the same fabric). Since I cut the skirt part against the grain (notobvious difference with this fabric and the pattern), it would probably have even fit on 1.7 m if I had made the pockets from a different material. If even more volume is taken out of the skirt, then it would need even less fabric. 

Very nice piece! Love the fabric: it's a bit heavier than "normal" viscose, has a very nice drape, and doesn't crease much.
