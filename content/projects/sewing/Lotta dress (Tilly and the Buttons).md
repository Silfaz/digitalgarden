title: "Lotta dress"

Very nice piece! It's a simple dress that you just throw on and you're styled. No buttons, no zips, no fastenings. With the short sleeves it's a nice mix between casual and elegant looking. Love the fabric: it's a bit heavier than "normal" viscose, has a very nice drape, and doesn't crease much. 

### Pattern
Tilly and the Buttons, size 4 https://shop.tillyandthebuttons.com/products/lotta

### Fabric
100% Lenzing Ecovero Viscose from Kattun Stoffe, Floral shade bottle green, 165 g/m2, 1.45 m width. Suggested length: 2.5 m, actual needed: 2 m (since skirt part was cut against the grain). 

### Adjustments
Short sleeves, cut length to just above knee, a bit less volume (i.e. width) in the skirt section. Added deep side pockets (cut in the same fabric). Since I cut the skirt part against the grain (not obvious difference with this fabric and the pattern), it would probably have even fit on **1.7 m** if I had made the pockets from a different material. If even more volume is taken out of the skirt, then it would need even less fabric. 

### Next time
- Get less fabric than indicated in pattern description (see above).
- Bias binding instead of facing for the neckline? The facing always flips up and peeks out. 
- Slightly wider elastic, I like the look of that (similar to [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfLf1UFMzfJ/)).
- Maybe try a longer version with patch pocket in a double gauze, like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CevjUlwsH4J/?)?
- In Gingham fabric like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrTy5Yws9p8/)? Or graphic print like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsIihHxsnau/))? Or in jersey like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsqPMfrMm9t/)?
