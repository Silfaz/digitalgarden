title: "Stacker Jacket (Papercut Patterns)"
---

### Pattern
Papercut Patterns, size 4. Variation 1 with front patch pockets.


### Fabric
1. Main fabric: Wide corduroy, bought at fabric outlet Skroten, Kinna. Light blue. I dyed it light blue/turquoise after a while, because it had some pink highlighter marks that wouldn't go away. It turned out a bit blotchy and I didn't really wear it. Then after a year I dyed it again in a slightly darker blue and now I really like it. Lining: Dark-blue lining fabric (acrylic? nylon?) from Skroten. 
2. Main fabric: Dark blue twill. Bought at Komolka, Vienna.  Lining and collar stand: Light blue cotton with golden stars. Bought at Komolka, Vienna.
