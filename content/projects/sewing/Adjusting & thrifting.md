## 60s dress
Bought this dress in May 2024 at Busfrön Malmö for 150 SEK.

I love the fabric (even though it's pretty plasticy), but the cuffs and collar remind me too much of a fancy dress or clown costume. The dress is also a bit too roomy. 
Options:
- Cut cuffs off (and insert elastic?)
- Remove or redo collar
- Shorten hemline
- Raise and/or take in waist

With or without cuffs:
