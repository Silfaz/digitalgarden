The only sewing project so far that I completely abandoned after being almost done. 
It had been lying in my sewing cupboard for at least 1.5 years, because I wasn't really excited about it whenever I looked at it. It was so BIG and LONG, and the fabric needed ironing whenever I decided to continue working on it. 
I eventually finished it with just the hemming to be done, and realised that I didn't like it at all and would never wear it. Then I cut it all open, and now I'm thinking of either reusing the fabric scraps for a kind of tank top, or just abandon it completely and move on with my life.

## Pattern
Maison Fauve, size 38.
MUCH too big. This blouse is so roomy, I could fit three times into it. 

## Fabric
Mustard-coloured flowy viscose, Kattun Stoffe. 
Quite slippery fabric that creases like crazy and needs to be ironed all the time.
