## Pattern
Self-drafted

## Fabric
Bamboo jersey in mustard yellow from Kattun Stoffe. Quite lightweight, flowy and very stretchy (in all 4 directions). Not ideal for skirts though, because it starts being a bit bobbly where I sit. And while it's not see-through, outlines of underwear show a lot. Also, it stains very easily. 
Elastic is grey and sparkly, from Selfmade (formerly Stoff & Stil).

## Next time
Would pick a different fabric, not that flowy, thin and stretchy. Although it's very comfortable, I rarely wear it out.
