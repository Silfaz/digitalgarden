## Pattern
Southbank sweater and sweaterdress.
Nina Lee London, size 6-20
Sweaterdress: version 1
Sweater: version 2

## Fabric
Quite un-stretchy jacquard in dark grey with golden sparkly lightning bolts, from Selfmade (formerly Stoff & Stil). 

## Adjustments
For the jumper version I changed the neckline, because I didn't want it as tight and high. Turned out slightly too wide, but it's ok.
