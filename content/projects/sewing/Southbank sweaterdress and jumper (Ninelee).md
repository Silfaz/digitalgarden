## Pattern
Southbank sweater and sweaterdress.
Nina Lee London, size 6-20
1. Sweaterdress: version 1
2. Sweater: version 2
3. Sweater: version 3 

## Fabric
1. Quite un-stretchy jacquard in dark grey with golden sparkly lightning bolts, from Selfmade (formerly Stoff & Stil). 
2. Same as 1.
3. Very soft and cosy light beige Organic French Terry, brushed from Kattun Stoffe. 

## Adjustments
### Dress and jumper 1 and 2
For the jumper version I changed the neckline, because I didn't want it as tight and high. Turned out slightly too wide, but it's ok. 
For the dress I removed the pockets, as they were far too low down, and quite bulky.

### Jumper 3
Made the cropped version 3, but added a slightly shorter version of the dress' hem band. Left the collar as is this time, and I quite like it. 
Made it for me and for my sister for Christmas.
