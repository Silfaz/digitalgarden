I love this skirt, especially in the slightly heaver and stiffer upholstery fabric, because it keeps its shape very nicely, like an upside-down tulip. I found the pattern quite easy (it was one of the first patterns I ever tried to sew), but it has a zip in the back which is a bit fiddly, especially with thicker fabrics. It has nice pockets, which enhance the tulip shape even more. 

## Pattern
Sew Over It, size 10. https://sewoverit.com/product/tulip-skirt-pdf-sewing-pattern/

## Fabric
1. Leftover sofa upholstery fabric, gifted by ReCreate Design, Gothenburg. Light green with beige relief (embroidered?) checkered pattern. 

2. Canvas, bought at fabric outlet Skroten, Kinna. Teal-coloured with dark blue, white and mustard-coloured brushes or eyes.
