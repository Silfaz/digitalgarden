Ripped elbows on a flannel shirt

I put a generous piece of quilting cotton on the inside and stitched that onto the sleeve to give the hole structure from the back and keep it from moving around too much. 

For the outside, I cut out two big ovals of dark-grey felt that I had at home. It's probably not the most durable fabric, but it fit well in colour, weight and feeling to the flannel. 
I stitched it to the shirt fabric with a very narrow zig-zag stitch, basically a buttonhole setting. Used rusty orange thread to have a nice contrast to the grey. 

By opening the cuffs it was juuust about possible to sew everything on the sewing machine.
