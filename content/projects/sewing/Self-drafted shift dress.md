Here with Angie-made wooly hat. 
### Pattern
This dress was made by my mum with a self-drafted pattern, modelled after a shift dress I own and love. It's quite simple, with wrist-length sleeves, one bust dart on each side and bias binding on the neckline. It does however have a yoke with a slight gathering in the middle of the back for extra room. 

### Fabric
Not sure, some thicker flannel-y fabric without any stretch.
