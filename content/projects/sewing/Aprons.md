title: Aprons
---
_Made: December 2024_

## Pattern
Self-drafted, with help of the book _Heavy-duty sewing"_ by Sandqvist.
## Fabric
Poplin from Kattun Stoffe. 

## Adjustments
The pattern I drafted from Sandqvist's book had quite narrow curved edges and they were a PAIN to hem. I tried for a bit, then got really frustrated, and then tried to straighten out those steep curves a bit. 
Then I also realised that the proportions of the Sandqvist pattern are WAY off for me, resulting in waist ties that would tie around my mid-thighs rather than by waist. I didn't have the time and energy to properly fix this, so my solution was that you have to make a little fold in the apron when you put it on. I think that works fine, and then it's more adjustable to the wearer's size/length. 

Overall, I would probably not make this pattern again but copy from an existing apron that I like the shape and length of.

I do like the slanted side pockets in the Sandqvist pattern, but I'm not sure how useful they really are. How much stuff are you putting into your pockets while cooking?
