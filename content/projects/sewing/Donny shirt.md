Very airy and comfortable shirt. Quite cropped in the front (is it supposed to be shorter in the front than in the back?) - might make it a little bit longer next time. 
I definitely want to make this shirt in different fabrics, and also make a dress hack. It looks lovely, the sleeves are exactly as I like them - slightly puffy, perfectly on the shoulders, good length and not too tight. The only adjustment was that I closed the cleavage a bit higher because my bra was peeking out. 

## Pattern
Friday Pattern Company, size S. See [Donny shirt pictures & fabric](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt%20pictures%20&%20fabric.md)

## Fabric
1. Linen
2. Ecovero viscose
3. Ecovero viscose
4. Gingham cotton

## Adjustments
#### Version 1
Size S. I had about 1 m2 of linen left from my [Tula pants](projects/sewing/Tula%20pants%20&%20shorts%20(Papercut%20Patterns).md) and managed to squeeze the Donny shirt out of it, with disregard of the grainline. I also had to make the collar in a different fabric and chose a simple quilting cotton. It's visible, but I think that looks quite nice actually. 
Very short, especially in the front. Belly shows when I move.

#### Version 2
Size S. Made with leftover fabric from [Lotta dress (Tilly and the Buttons)](projects/sewing/Lotta%20dress%20(Tilly%20and%20the%20Buttons).md) - a dark green and black, flowery Lyocell viscose from Kattun Stoffe. I didn't have quite enough, so for some of the collar pieces I used some black fabric that I got from Tante Irmi, probably also a viscose or some polyester. Feels quite similar in weight and structure to the main fabrick. 
I **lengthened the front and back by 3.5 cm**, which resulted in a very good length for me. Again, I hand-stitched the collar close much higher up than intended by the pattern, otherwise my bra would show all the time.

#### Version 3
Rust-coloured Ecovero Leia crepe solid Sienna (Mind the maker) from Kattun Stoffe. Made for Mama for Mother's day 2024. Size S. 
Bought 1.3 m, which was plenty. Maybe next time order only 1.1 m. 
Same kind of fabric as I used for Donny version 2, and [Lotta dress](projects/sewing/Lotta%20dress%20(Tilly%20and%20the%20Buttons).md). Very nice, flowy fabric with some weight. Doesn't crease much and is easy to iron. But does fray like crazy if not overlocked!
I **lengthened the front and back by 3.5 cm**, and sewed slightly more seam allowance around the collar corners so the facing doesn't poke out. I also hand-sewed the front neckline more shut.

#### Version 4
Gingham cotton (Vichy), light grey and white, from tyg.se. Made for Angie. Size S. 
I **lengthened the front and back by 3.5 cm**. 
This time, instead of hand-sewing the collar more closed as the last step, I **moved the collar marking from size S to a size 4XL**. This worked really well to get the collar opening to a height that I liked.
