title: "Donny shirt"
---

Very airy and comfortable shirt. Quite cropped in the front (is it supposed to be shorter in the front than in the back?) - might make it a tiiiny bit longer next time. 
I definitely want to make this shirt in different fabrics, and also make a dress hack. It looks lovely, the sleeves are exactly as I like them - slightly puffy, perfectly on the shoulders, good length and not too tight. The only adjustment was that I closed the cleavage a bit higher because my bra was peeking out. 

### Pattern
Friday Pattern Company, size S. See [Donny shirt pictures & fabric](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt%20pictures%20&%20fabric.md)

### Fabric
Version 1: I had about 1 m2 of linen left from my [Tula pants](projects/sewing/Tula%20pants%20&%20shorts%20(Papercut%20Patterns).md) and managed to squeeze the Donny shirt out of it, with disregard of the grainline. I also had to make the collar in a different fabric and chose a simple quilting cotton. It's visible, but I think that looks quite nice actually.
