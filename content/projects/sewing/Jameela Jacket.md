Cozy jacket pattern with two length options: Hip length or cropped. Unlined, simple design lines. Two big welt pockets at the front and a box pleat at the back. The cropped version comes with a sleeve placket and a sleeve cuff whilst the longer version features a simple sleeve hem. 

## Suggested fabrics
Mid- to heavy weight woven fabrics are best suited for this pattern, like: 
-   Canvas   
-   Thick denim    
-   Corduroy    
-   Twill    
-   Wool    
-   Jacquard

For thicker fabrics like wool or heavy weight jacquard, sew the boxy sleeve option of view B. It is very hard to sew the sleeve placket and cuff of view A with thicker fabrics.
