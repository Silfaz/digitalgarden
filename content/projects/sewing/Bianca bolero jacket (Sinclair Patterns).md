_Here with [Indigo dress](projects/sewing/Indigo%20dress%20(Tilly%20and%20the%20Buttons).md)._ 

Cute bolero, ideal for combining with fancier dresses when it's a bit cooler. 

## Pattern
Sinclair Patterns, size US4/UK10. 
Fits _perfectly._

## Fabric
Jacquard jersey misty mint from Kattun Stoffe. 
Bought 1.4m, which was plenty. 
Fabric is quite stiff, but that makes the jacket feel a bit more expensive and it's nice that it's not slinky and doesn't stretch out.
