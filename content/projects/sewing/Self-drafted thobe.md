title: Self-drafted thobe

Duncan wanted a long, flowy night gown or lounge wear that he could wear at home. Worked really well, he wore both versions a lot, but after a while preferred the jersey one because it was more comfortable. I repurposed the woven cotton one into a [Dust cover](projects/sewing/Dust%20covers.md) for the electric piano.
## Pattern
Self-drafted from a t-shirt, then just elongated down. 
For version 2 I followed a Youtube tutorial for a small mandarin-style stand-up collar with buttons.

## Fabric
1. Cotton bed sheet, dust blue. 
2. Bamboo jersey from Kattun Stoffe. Blue with light blue swirls.
