Bad pattern, nothing lined up properly and it was very tricky to get anything together. Had to redraft several pieces myself and force things together. 
## Pattern
Juliana Martejevs, size S.
## Fabric
Cotton poplin ordered from online shop with self-designed print (40 strokes in a circle - I originally wanted to gift this blouse to my sister for her 40th birthday but then didn't get the fabric in time...). 

## Adjustments
I re-drafted the sleeves because they were sticking out in a weird way and not aligning with the front and back pieces. Don't know what went wrong. It fit better with the new sleeves, but don't love the cut.

## Next time
Not sure there will be a next time, because it was a quite frustrating make. It's very cropped, perhaps I would lengthen it a bit. And the shapes of the sleeves are not great, especially around the sleeve socket. Collar is a bit wonky, the pieces didn't really match up as described in the instructions.
