## Suggested fabrics
For 115 cm width: 1.3 m. For 140-150 cm width: 1.1 m. 
Any sort of light to medium weight woven fabric is suitable, e.g. cotton, linen. If you choose a  mid-weight fabric like twill or denim you will get a more structured top. If you choose a drapier fabric like rayon or silk you will get a blousier top.

## Sew-along

VERY useful, since the instructions are quite minimal and there are some complicated steps involving the collar and the burrito method.

_(Donny shirt hack: Shortened the shirt hem, side seams were 8” long, cut 2 rectangles for the skirt (total width of about 125cm - could have made the width smaller as there is so much volume but then I actually don’t mind the end result. Lots of gathering though!). Length of the skirt attached is 34”, I wanted a maxi but almost midi look. Fabric: Cotton linen fabby from [@spotlightstores](https://www.instagram.com/spotlightstores/).
