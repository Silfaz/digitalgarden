### Pieces to remember

> Foreword by Bibbe Hansen: (...) The activity of art is to process the universe through the matrix of one's own being and then to express that experience into the world. Folks often choose not to live consciously and instead aggressively pursue activities and mind spaces that numb and mute any small voice of consciousness that might awaken their attention. Many are quite satisfied to respond to life with a series of default behaviors, opinions, and responses that have been collected and stored since childhood.

> By treating creativity like a daily process - like eating dinner or exercising - you will allow your mind to prepare for that time, thus making it feel more fruitful and methodical, as opposed to random and unexpected.

> How can you let your mind wander with purpose? _This_ is where listening can be our helpful field guide as we navigate creative endeavors. Listening is how our mind activates the fine-tuned aspects of perception that help us understand and decipher the world.
