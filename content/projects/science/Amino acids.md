Amino acids contain both an amino (-NH2) and a carboxylic (-COOH) functional group.

The carbon atom next to the carboxyl group is called the __alpha-carbon__. Amino acids containing an amino group bonded direclty to the alpha-carbon are referred to as __alpha-amino acids__. 

pKa = acid dissociation constant. It indicates whether an acid is a strong acid or a weak acid. The lower the pKa, the more easily it gives up its proton. The higher the pKa, the more tightly the proton is held. Strong acids have pKa of less than zero. 

At physiological pH (pH 7), most aas have a **COO-** group and a **NH3+** group and are therefore zwitterions: -NH3+-CHR-COO-. This form predominates at pH values between the two pKas (the pKa of the amino group and the pKa of the carboxyl group). The so-called "neutral" forms -NH2-CHR-COOH are not present to any measurable degree at neutral pH. At strongly acidic conditions (pH < 3), the carboxylate group becomes protonated (-COOH), resulting in -NH3+-CHR-COOH. At strongly basic conditions (pH > 10) the ammonio group is deprotonated to give -NH2-CHR-COO-. The acidic amino acids have an additional **COO-** group at pH 7.

## Chemistry of amino acids
### Acidic amino acids
- Misleading name, since those aas can accept a proton (and are therefore Bronsted bases). 
- [Aspartic acid](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Aspartic%20acid.md) and [Glutamic acid](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Glutamic%20acid.md)
- **Polar** and negatively charged at physiological pH.
- Have two carboxyl groups. 
- The corresponding amides [Asparagine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Asparagine.md) and [Glutamine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Glutamine.md) are **polar** and uncharged. 
- Both acidic aas and the amides are very **hydrophilic**. 
- [Tyrosine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Tyrosine.md) and [Cysteine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Cysteine.md), which act primarily as acids at neutral pH, are usually forgotten in this classification. 

### Aliphatic amino acids
- From least to most hydrophobic: [[projects/science/Amino acids/Glycine]], [[projects/science/Amino acids/Alanine]], [[projects/science/Amino acids/Valine]], [[projects/science/Amino acids/Leucine]], [[projects/science/Amino acids/Isoleucine]]. Hydrophobicity increases with the number of C atoms in the hydrocarbon chain. 
- **Non-polar** and **hydrophobic**. 
- Prefer to remain inside protein molecules. [[projects/science/Amino acids/Glycine]] and [[projects/science/Amino acids/Alanine]] are ambivalent (i.e. can be inside or outside). 

### Aromatic amino acids
- Relatively **non-polar**.
- Absorb UV light. [[Tryptophane]] absorbs the strongest, at 280 nm. 
- From least to most hydrophobic: [Tyrosine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Tyrosine.md), [Trypotphane](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Trypotphane.md), [Phenylalanine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Phenylalanine.md). 


### Basic amino acids
- **Polar** and **positively-charged** (-NH3+) at neutral pH.
- Very **hydrophilic**. 
- [Arginine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Arginine.md), [Lysine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Lysine.md), [Histidine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Histidine.md).
- Almost always in contact with the solven (i.e. on outside of protein). 
- Misleading classification, since [Histidine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Histidine.md) acts as both Bronsted base and acid, [Lysine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Lysine.md) acts primarily as Bronsted acid (i.e. accepts a proton), and [Arginine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Arginine.md) has a fixed positive charge. 


### Cyclic amino acids
- [Proline](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Proline.md)
- **Non-polar**

### Hydroxyl amino acids
- **Polar**, uncharged at neutral pH, **hydrophilic**.
- [Serine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Serine.md), [Threonine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Threonine.md), [Tyrosine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Tyrosine.md)

### Sulfur-containing amino acids
- [Cysteine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Cysteine.md), [Methionine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Methionine.md)
- **Non-polar**, **hydrophobic**. 


## Interactions

Water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic resides buried on the inside, whereas hydrophilic residues are exposed to the outside. Integral membrane proteins have exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them in the lipid bilayer. Proteins that have to bind to positely charged molecules have surfaces rich in negatively charged amino acids, and the other way round (e.g. low-complexity regions of nucleic acid-binding proteins contain a lot of lysine and arginine).
