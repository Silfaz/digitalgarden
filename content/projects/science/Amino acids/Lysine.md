**Lys - K**


- The side chain of [Lysine](projects/science/Amino%20acids/Lysine.md) has marked hydrocarbon character, so it's often found _near_ the surface, with the amino group of the side chain in contact with the solvent. 
- Lysine (and arginine) is present in large amounts in the low-complexity regions of nucleic-acid binding proteins.
