## Homemade pasta (tagliatelli)
- 350 mL water
- 5 Tbsp olive oil
- 500 g durum flour
- 250 g regular wheat flour

1. Mix the ingredients well in a big bowl. Once incorporated, tip the dough out on a clean surface. 
2. Knead the dough for 12-15 min resulting in a very smooth and homogeneous dough ball. 
3. Wrap it tight in clingfilm, then let it rest in the fridge for 30 min. 
4. Divide the dough in 4 roughly equal pieces. Take one at a time, leave the others in the fridge for now. 
5. Roll the dough through the pasta machine, folding in between: 5-6 times at 1, 3, 5, 6. Then once at 7, dust the surface with a bit of flour, then run through the tagliatelli cutter. Drape loosly on the table, let dry for 15 min, then drop in boiling, well salted water and cook for 2-3 min. Drain, serve.
