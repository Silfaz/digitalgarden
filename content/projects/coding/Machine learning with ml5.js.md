## Beginner's Guide

Machine learning = Teaching a computer to perform a task without explicitly programming the algorithm to fulfil this task. 


 - ml5.js https://itp.nyu.edu/adjacent/issue-3/ml5-friendly-open-source-machine-learning-library-for-the-web/
 - ml5.js and tf.js (Tensor Flow) are JS libraries used for machine learning. ml5.js is built on top of TF. https://ml5js.org/
 - ML algorithms: e.g. neural network
 - ML models: e.g. pretrained (such as MobileNet, PoseNet). Model takes input and gives output with confidence percentages to make a prediction. 
 - Supervised learning: dataset (e.g. containing images and corresponding labels) --> used to train the ML
