## Computer: 
Open OBS. 
Scenes: android, iphone, start screen
iPhone should connect automatically. 
Android: double click to access menu --> takes a while to shop up
Make sure that audio from cameras is off. Desktop audio is on.

Select view in scenes menu.
Previe & live view --> transition preferably with Fade
Check if both cameras look good: straight, sharp, no light source in the way, plotterhead not in the way

Charge both cameras
Set light source to cool light

## Youtube:
Plottervision --> go live
New stream --> fill in info
Change thumbnail to plottervision logo --> OK
Streamkey: copy --> in OBS: settings (right bottom corner) > Stream --> paste stream key --> OK
Then "start streaming" in OBS
Then it will shop up in the youtube window

## Music:
Chillhop
Log in --> connect with chillhop
Dashboard > Browser music > Start streaming
Close everything on the computer that could make a sound!!

## Youtube:
Go live

Make sure that everything is going well. Check youtube on the iPad.
Keep an eye on the current view, sometimes the cameras need to be refocussed. 
Say hello in the chat and answer questions. 

In the end, say goodbye to people. 
Show result for a while, then fade to title screen. Leave title screen in youtube for 10 sec, tune down music level in OBS, then press END STREAM. 

Then youtube renders the video. Then trim the beginning so logo is there for 1-2 sec only. Press preview on the bottom. If you're happy, press save as new.
Then add video info when the processing is done (e.g. end screen with suggestions for next video).
