## Packages

_Packages_ enable you to build a program out of separate pieces or run these pieces on their own, and also apply the same pieces in different programs. 
A _package_ is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed) on its own. It may contain one or more _modules_ and has information about which other packages it depends on. 

NPM is a repository of JS packages.
