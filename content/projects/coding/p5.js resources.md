title: "p5.js resources"
---


Daniel Shiffman's Youtube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/playlists) is AMAZING and a great resource for p5.js programming, mainly for creative coding/generative art, but also some machine learning, working with data and APIs, etc. 

[The Nature of Code playlist](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/playlists) is particularly good. It's about re-creating natural movements and phenomena in p5, e.g. flow fields, fractals, physics simulations, genetic networks. [Here](projects/coding/The%20Nature%20of%20Code.md) are my notes of going through the playlist.
