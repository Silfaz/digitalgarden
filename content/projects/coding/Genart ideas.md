Randomly placed points, connected to their nearest neightbours with dashed line, but only to their below neighbours. 



## Generative art stitching
- Turn a genart piece into instructions for cross stitching (by pixellating and assigning colours)
- Input/scan the colours of threads you have in your stash to limit the art piece to those colours --> generate a pattern with only those colours.
- Input desired size of piece to match with what you want to get in the real world.
- With sliders: select style of art, degree of distortion, etc. 
- Include real data as input: e.g. real numbers instead of random as seed or real dataset that's loaded in and then interpreted.
- Spits out an instruction template with the chosen colours (e.g. turn colours into letters, yellow = y, light green = lg, etc. for easy print-out).
