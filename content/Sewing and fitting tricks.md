Always fit from the top down! First length of waist, then scroop of crotch, then crotch length etc.

Fit one thing at a time and try on in between! 

## Crotch curve

Too tight in butt, draglines across butt pointing straight at crotch --> crotchline not scooped out enough

Crotch point should sit nicely in the middle of your crotch. If you feel like you need to pull the trousers backwards or forwards to make them fit well, you probably need to adjust the crotch curve.

If It _either_ fits when you pull it towards the back _or_ towards the front, but not both --> extend crotch curve slightly on either the front or the back piece. If you pull it towards the front and it fits, but then the crotch point is too far forward, it needs extension on the front piece. Vice versa for the back piece.
