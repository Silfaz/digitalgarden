Recipe: **[Fermented apples and butternut squash](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Fermented%20apples%20and%20butternut%20squash)**

Made: _2022-10-30_
Made with apples I got from my colleague and neighbour Kerstin. It's a mix of two different apple trees, one of which is more for cooking/baking and the other one more for direct eating. I used about 8 small to medium-sized apples. 

To test addition of lactobacillus starter cultures, I divided the cut veggies and fruits into four jars:
1. no starter culture
2. + Acidophilus starter culture
3. + Vege092 starter culture
4. + Vege011 starter culture

1. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a little bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft. Not very acidic at all yet, leave a bit longer. Add a teaspoon full of liquid from a carrot ferment that's fermenting alongside to speed up fermentation a bit. 
2. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fridge.**
