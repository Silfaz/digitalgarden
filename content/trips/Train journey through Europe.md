### Dog things
All European countries that we went through seem to have slightly different rules when it comes to dogs. 
The easiest are Luxemburg and Sweden - no tickets or muzzle needed. The priciest is Germany, where a dog ticket costs 50% of the adult ticket price, which can get very expensive. 

#### Sweden 
No muzzle or ticket needed. Dog-specific areas on most trains. 
#### Denmark 
Needs child's ticket (12-15 years) on public transport and additionally seat reservation on intercity trains. 

#### Germany
Needs child's ticket (6-14 years) or dog ticket: usually half price of an adult ticket. No seat reservation needed. Must be on leash and wear muzzle. 

#### Netherlands
Day dog tickets available for 3.30 EUR, valid on domestic trains. 
For Intercity train to Belgium (not Thalys!), dog ticket costs 6 EUR. Dog should be leashed and wear a muzzle. 

#### Belgium
Day dog ticket for 3 EUR, valid for all public transport. No mandatory muzzle. 

#### Luxemburg
Dogs of all sizes travel for free on trains and public transport. No mandatory muzzle.

#### Austria
Muzzle and leash mandatory. Dog tickets are 10% of normal ticket price.
