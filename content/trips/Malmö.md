## Restaurants
- **Pink Head Noodle Bar**: Creative noodle dishes, ok prices. I had a fermented black bean noodle dish with deliciously wide-cut noodles. No dogs allowed inside, but they have some tables outside in the summer.
- **Mitt M√∂llan food court**: Very relaxed atmosphere, nice hang-out place during lunch or early evening. Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese dumplings, bao, Indian, and my favourie **Mai Bento**. It's _amazing_. Dogs are allowed in the mall, but not in the food court.
- **Delhi**: Indian restaurant with vegetarian and vegan options for basically any dish. Including "chicken" sizzlers. 
- **400 Grader**: Great Neaopolitain-style pizza. 
- **Far i Hatten**: In the middle of Folkets Park with a great outside seating area in summer. Good pizza, nice place to hang out and have a beer.

- **K√§rleksgatan 3**
- **Lera**
- **Dashi**

## Caf√©s & bakeries
- **Caf√© Jesusbaren**: Cosy, creative, kitschy and calm. I love Jesusbaren (and so does the whole neighbourhood, it's hard to get a place at 2 on a Saturday). Not much food (avo toast, some cake), but it's more for the nice atmosphere. üê∂
- **Farina**
- **Sansa vegan coffee Malm√∂**
- **Beans & Tales Caf√©**: Cute interior, simple dishes (salads) and cakes. üê∂
- **Bageri Leve**: All vegan bakery with delicious stuff and some tables. On Saturdays they have donuts. üê∂
