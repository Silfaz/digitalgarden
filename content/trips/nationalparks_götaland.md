## Stenshuvuds nationalpark
Near Simrishamn and Kivik, on Skåne's east coast. Three little mountains with a view over the coast and to the Danish island Bornholm. Sandy beaches at the bottom (badplats!). Nice arboreum.
Fairly small and can easily be done in a day. Quite many people around (during summer season). Not really a "wild" national park, but still nice to walk through. 

Went there in August 2021: [Stenshuvuds nationalpark](trips/Stenshuvuds%20nationalpark.md) 

#### How to get there on public transport
Bus to Kivik (via Kristianstad) or bus via Lund and Simrishamn. Then the last few kilometers walking (6 km, e.g. along Skåneleden from Kivik to Simrishamn) or taxi.

#### Stay overnight
Camp ground at the northern entrance. Hotels and guesthouses in Kivik. 

#### Hiking routes
Skåneleden goes through. 
Very easy to find hiking trails, well marked. The longest is not even 5 km long. 


## Dalby Söderkogs nationalpark
Sweden's smallest national park. Old southern Swedish leafy forest (oak, beech). Augustiner kloster from 1060s.

## Söderåsen nationalpark
North-western Skåne, near Helsingborg. Goes from Åstorp to Röstånga. Lies exactly between European and Scandinavian continental plates, which formed a ravine and pushed up a small mountain (Kopparhatten, 200 m). 

Beech forests, high cliffs, ravines and a little river running through. Good views all around from the top of Kopparhatten. Quite small, but still Northern Europe's biggest protected leafy forest.

## Åsnens nationalpark
Sweden's youngest national park (2018). Like a Sweden in miniature. Forests, lakes, islands. Nice in all seasons, but especially in winter when it's possible to walk on frozen lakes or in the autumn when Småland's mushroom Koralltaggsvampen grows. Many different kinds of trees including 250 year old beech trees.
