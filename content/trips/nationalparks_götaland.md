## Stenshuvuds nationalpark
Near Simrishamn and Kivik, on Skåne's east coast. Three little mountains with a view over the coast and to the Danish island Bornholm. Sandy beaches at the bottom (badplats!). Nice arboreum.
Fairly small and can easily be done in a day. Quite many people around (during summer season). Not really a "wild" national park, but still nice to walk through. 

Went there in August 2021: [Stenshuvuds nationalpark](trips/Stenshuvuds%20nationalpark.md) 

#### How to get there on public transport
Bus to Kivik (via Kristianstad) or bus via Lund and Simrishamn. Then the last few kilometers walking (6 km, e.g. along Skåneleden from Kivik to Simrishamn) or taxi.

#### Stay overnight
Camp ground at the northern entrance. Hotels and guesthouses in Kivik. 

#### Hiking routes
Skåneleden goes through. 
Very easy to find hiking trails, well marked. The longest is not even 5 km long. 


## Dalby Söderkogs nationalpark
Sweden's smallest national park. Old southern Swedish leafy forest (oak, beech). Augustiner kloster from 1060s. 

#### Good to know
- Prettiest in spring when vitsippor and gulsippor are covering the ground. 
- The naturrum is in Skrylle naturreservat.

#### How to get there on public transport
Bus (50 min) from Lund Central.

#### Stay overnight
Vinskydd in neighbouring Skrylle naturreservat. 

#### Hiking routes
Three walking routes (0.5-3.5 km). One of them - Skryllestigen - then continues on through the naturreservat Dalby Norreskog and further to Skrylle naturreservat, which is actually much bigger than Dalby Söderskog. 


## Söderåsen nationalpark
North-western Skåne, near Helsingborg. Goes from Åstorp to Röstånga. Lies exactly between European and Scandinavian continental plates, which formed a ravine and pushed up a small mountain (Kopparhatten, 200 m). 

Beech forests, high cliffs, ravines and a little river running through. Good views all around from the top of Kopparhatten. Quite small, but still Northern Europe's biggest protected leafy forest.

Went there in June 2022: [Söderåsen nationalpark](trips/Söderåsen%20nationalpark.md)

#### Good to know
- Main entrance is in Skäralid, the Southern entrance in Röstånga. 
- Possible to go up Kopparhatten with the car.

#### How to get there on public transport
Train to Klippan, then bus to Skäralid or Röstånga (30 min). 

#### Stay overnight
Camp grounds and vindskydd can be found at Dahlbergs and Liagården. Guesthouses in Röstånga. 

#### Hiking routes
Skåneleden goes through the park (from Röstånga to Skäralid and then further on to Klåveröd). Several other trails between 2 and 7 km long starting from both Skäralid or Röstånga.
