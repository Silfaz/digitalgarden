The trips I have collected here are mostly located around (Southern) Sweden, since that's where I live. And most of them involve walking or hiking, since that's what I like to do 🙃. 

Any travelling necessary for them is done by public transport (preferably train) -  no flying or car-ownership necessary 🌲🚞🚃🏔️🌳🌲🌲🌊
