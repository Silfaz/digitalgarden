> It always seems impossible until it's done. - _Nelson Mandela_ 



> Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. - _Epictetus_


>It's incorrect to say we eat food because we need the energy it contains. The conservation of energy means that it is neither created nor destroyed; we are radiating energy constantly, at pretty much the same rate that we absorb it. The difference is that the heat energy we radiate is a high-entropy form of energy, meaning it's disordered. The chemical energy we absorb is a low-entropy form of energy, meaning it's ordered. In effect, we are consuming order and generating disorder; we live by increasing the disorder of the universe. It's only because the universe started in a highly ordered state that we are able to exist at all. - _From Roger Penroses's book The Emporer's New Mind (via Ted Chiang's Exhalation).
