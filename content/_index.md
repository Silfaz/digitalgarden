title: "ðŸª´ Digital Garden"
---

This is my digital garden, a place that is never finished and always growing. It reflects some of my past, current and future interests, projects, and inspirations. Not a complete resource, more of a collection of notes, a documentation of experiments, a second brain. 

Feel free to walk around and explore.
