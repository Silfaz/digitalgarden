First introduction to digital gardens, with many nice examples. Makes me want to start right away. 

https://www.conordewey.com/blog/on-digital-gardening/
`A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, **where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public**. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.`

Don’t reinvent the wheel every time. Think about how your existing work and life can become the raw materials for your digital gardening/storytelling.

In gardening, it’s really not all about the outcome—it’s often about the time you spend out there, in the space you’re creating, tending to your creation and getting joy out of the abundance you’ve summoned from the earth.

What do visitor's gain from visiting your digital garden? Maybe: new ideas and insights. Opportunities to learn something new. Reading suggestions. Recipes. Stuff to try. Visual stimulation or an inspiring aesthetic. 


## Inspiration websites
### Projects
[Melanie Richards personal projects](https://melanie-richards.com/projects/#personalProjects/)
Projects website: e.g. snacks rating, crafts, drawing, coding, etc. Each has a little tile and branches off from there. 


### Lists
https://bucketlist.melanie-richards.com/
Super-nice list of things to do either in your area, or in general. When created, can be linked to the inspiration, and when finished can be linked to the result (e.g. a photo or a project).
I want to do this with going to places, cooking different things, learning things, milestones, just in general trying out a lot of things. 

https://seasons.melanie-richards.com/
Very nice design! Similar to the Japanese microseasons, this lists things happening in the author's area during the year, and some suggestions on what to do during that time. Cute icons.

### Books
https://amandapinsker.com/reading
I like the concise description about each book read, and that it's not just a collection of highlighted paragraphs. I don't like the humblebrag about the different locations where the books were read, though it is nice to accompany each book with a nice photo.

### Blogs
https://melanie-richards.com/blog/
Very simple design, similar to her projects page. I like the monthly Learning log, with lists of interesting articles, things she came across, etc. I might steal this to collect my finds and projects in a chronological way.
