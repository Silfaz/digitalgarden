Focus from now until April: Transport - reduce Helsingborg's environmental and climate impact when it comes to transport habits. Community, engage more members.

Staden bjuder in till samskapande och uppmuntrar initiativ som liger till grund för en hållbar livsstil. 

Half of all car journeys in HBG are less than 7 km!

Mostly middle-aged men take (short) car trips. 

**New purpose of Klimavtal:**
- Impact
- Educate
- Engage
--> in this way we can achieve increased awareness and changed behaviour among the citiziens of Helsingborg.

- Where do we have the best sphere of influence?
- What are you passionate about?
