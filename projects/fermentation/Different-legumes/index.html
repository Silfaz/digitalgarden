Looks just pale yellow. Toor dal and Chana dal have increased in size quite a lot and have the consistency of raw potato.</li><li>Cook: Chana dal and Green mung dal: <strong>5 min</strong>; Toor dal: <strong>10 min</strong>. Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. <code>Could use less soaking or less cooking time.</code> Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.</li><li>Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (<strong>4 Tbsp/kg</strong>), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix. Add 1/4 tsp (<strong>2 tsp/kg</strong>) tempeh starter (<em>topcultures</em>). Spread in perforated plastic bags, incubate in cupboard above freezer.</li><li>Growth: Passive warming, not controlled.

Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans <code>â€”> maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?</code> Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.

Black colour is visible underneath, but that&rsquo;s from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling <code>â€”> mix lentils with something else!</code> Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.

Discarded. <code>â€”> Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Fava beans</strong>: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy <code>â€”> dry the beans better next time and cook less!</code> Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets <code>â€”> press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.</code> Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.

Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.

The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It&rsquo;s sticky and slimy â€”> remove! <code>â€”> Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.</code> The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top <code>â€”> incubate for a shorter time!</code> Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag <code>â€”> Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.</code>

Both have kept a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; tasting texture, i.e. more beans and lentils than meaty. Interesting since I&rsquo;m sure earlier tempeh trials that resulted in very chewy-juicy tempeh were also incubated for 36-48h. Must be either the starter, the beans (e.g. soybeans) or the &ldquo;suboptimal&rdquo; incubation conditions in the fridge cupboard that cause the different texture. Both the 36h and 48h ones would be suitable for restaurants, whereas e.g. for a burger you&rsquo;d want something chewier and juicier.</p><p><code>Run some more trials with different conditions and beans to see when I get a juicier texture vs. a beanier-healthier texture.</code></p><a href=#black-eyed-beans--black-beans-2020-11-05><h2 id=black-eyed-beans--black-beans-2020-11-05><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Black eyed beans & black beans (2020-11-05)</h2></a><p>Soak for 24h: 125g black eyed beans, 125g black beans (from Fram).</p><a href=#black-eyed-beans><h4 id=black-eyed-beans><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Black-eyed beans</h4></a><p>Use as they are, don&rsquo;t try to dehull.
