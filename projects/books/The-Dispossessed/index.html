A person whose nature was genuinely unsociable had to get away from society and look after himself. He was completely free to do so. He could build himself a house wherever he liked (though if it spoiled a good view or a fertile bit of land he might find himself under heavy pressure from his neighours to move elsewhere).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A long time later, he was awake. He could breathe. He was perfectly well. Everything was all right. He felt disinclined to move. To move would disturb the perfect, stable moment, the balance of the world. The winter light along the ceiling was beautiful beyond expression. He lay and watched it. The old men down the ward were laughing together, old husky cackling laughs, a beautiful sound.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even from a brother there is no comfort in the bad hour, in the dark at the foot of the wall.</p></blockquote><a href=#chapter-5><h3 id=chapter-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 5</h3></a><blockquote><p>He worked at the Light Research Laboratories, read a great deal, and wrote three papers that summer and autumn: a productive half year, by normal standards. But he knew that in fact he had done nothing real.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He tried to read an elementary economics text; it bored him past endurance, it was like listening to somebody interminably recounting a long and stupid dream. He could not force himself to understand how banks functioned and so forth, because all of the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the money changers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men&rsquo;s acts, even the terrible became banal.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And the strangest thing about the nightmare street was that none of the millions of things for sale were made there. They were only sold there. Where were the workshops, the factories, where were the farmers, the craftsmen, the miners, the weavers, the chemists, the carvers, the dyers, the designers, the machinists, where were the hands, the people who made? Out of sight, somewhere else. Behind walls. All the people in all the shops were either buyers or sellers. They had no relation to the things but that of possession.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nobody owns anything to rob. If you want things you take them from the depository. As for violence, well, I don&rsquo;t know, Oiie; would you murder me, ordinarily? And if you felt like it, would a law against it stop you? Coercion is the least efficient means of obtaining order.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><a href=#chapter-6><h3 id=chapter-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 6</h3></a><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them. By refusing to think, refusing to change. And that&rsquo;s precisely what our society is doing!&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the night one of them cried out aloud, dreaming. The other one reached his arm out sleepily, muttering reassurance, and the blind warm weight of his touch outweighed all fear.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In a gap between eastern peaks a colorless luminosity of the sky heralded moonrise. The stream was noisy in the silence of the high, bare hills. There was no wind, no cloud. The air above the mountains was like amethyst, hard, clear, profound.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&mldr;complex concentric shapes made of wire, which moved and changed slowly and inwardly when suspended from the ceiling. She had made these with scarp wire and tools from the craft-supply depot, and called them <em>Occupations of Uninhabited Space</em>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She liked the work; it combined two things she valued: accurate, factual research and a specific goal of increase or betterment. Without such work she would not have been satisfied.</p></blockquote><a href=#chapter-7><h3 id=chapter-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 7</h3></a><blockquote><p>The only heavy snow of the winter fell that week. Shevek had never seen a snowfall of more than an inch or so. The extravagance, the sheer quantity, of the storm exhilarated him. He reveled in its excess. It was too white, too cold, silent, and indifferent to be called excremental by the sincerest Odonian; to see it as other than an innocent magnificence would be pettiness of soul.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He had been fascinated from the start by the Urrasti habit of wrapping everything up in clean, fancy paper or plastic or cardboard or foil. Laundry, books, vegetables, clothes, medicines, everything came inside layers and layers of wrappings. Even packets of paper were wrapped in several layers of paper. Nothing was to touch anything else. He had begun to feel that he, too, had been carefully packaged.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was the verbal mode of the Nioti, past and future rammed into one highly charged, unstable present tense.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Nio Esseia, a city of five million souls, lifted its delicate glittering towers across the green marshes of the Estuary as if it were built of mist and sunlight. As the train swung in smoothly on a long viaduct the city rose up taller, brighter, solider, until suddenly it enclosed the train entirely in the roaring darkness of an underground approach, twenty tracks together, and then released it and its passengers into the enormous, brilliant spaces of the Central Station, under the central dome of ivory and azure, said to be the largest dome ever raised on any world by the hand of man.</p></blockquote><a href=#chapter-8><h3 id=chapter-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 8</h3></a><blockquote><p>The validity of the promise, even promise of indefinite term, was deep in the grain of Odo&rsquo;s thinking; though it might seem that her insistence on freedom to change would invalidate the idea of promise or vow, in fact the freedom made the promise meaningful. A promise is a direction taken, a self-limitation of choice.</p></blockquote><a href=#chapter-10><h3 id=chapter-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 10</h3></a><blockquote><p>They walked along side by side. The autumn stars had come out, incredible in number and brilliance, twinkling and almost blinking because of the dust stirred up by the earthquake and the wind, so that the whole sky seemed to tremble, a shaking of diamond chips, a scintillation of sunlight on a black sea. Under that uneasy splendor the hills were dark and solid, the roofs hard-edged, the light of the street lamps mild.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The days were utterly peaceful, in the autumn sunlight, in the silence of the hills.</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/digitalgarden/private/Yearly-reviews/2022-Review/2022-Review/ data-ctx="The Dispossessed" data-src=/private/Yearly-reviews/2022-Review/2022-Review class=internal-link></a></li><li><a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/books_main/ data-ctx="The Dispossessed" data-src=/projects/books/books_main class=internal-link>Books main</a></li><li><a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/books_main-Silvias-MacBook-Pros-conflicted-copy-2024-04-09/ data-ctx="The Dispossessed" data-src=/projects/books/books_main-Silvias-MacBook-Pros-conflicted-copy-2024-04-09 class=internal-link>Books main</a></li></ul></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Silvia HÃ¼ttner using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/silfaz>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Silfaz>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
