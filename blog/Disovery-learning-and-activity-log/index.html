With our dog üê∂.<ul><li><em>Don&rsquo;t chain trains.</em> Delays <strong>will</strong> occur. It&rsquo;s so much nicer, and less stressful to stop more frequently, only have a few hours of train travel each day, arrive in the next destination earlier in the day and have a chance to explore it a bit. Also, delays won&rsquo;t bother you if you don&rsquo;t have to catch another train. More time to read!</li><li><em>Don&rsquo;t be overly ambitious</em>. We usually left a place at around 10, that leaves time for a nice breakfast and morning walk. Then buy a snack, get on the train for a few hours. Dog sleeps, we read, listen, watch, chat, snooze, eat. Early afternoon, we arrive, walk to the hotel, drop off our stuff, rest a bit and then head out for exploring the city and look for a nice caf√© or restaurant for early dinner.</li><li><em>Pick <strong>one</strong> thing to see in each place</em>. Even in the most boring seeming places, there is <em>something</em> to explore. It&rsquo;s good to look that thing up before you arrive, so the visits in the various places are not all just aimless wandering. It can be nice to aimlessly wander, but it also gets a bit tiring. For example in Kolding, we visited the model village
<a href=https://koldingminiby.dk/da_dk/ rel=noopener>Miniby</a> and the botanical garden around it. In Hamburg, we went to the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherstadt rel=noopener>Speicherstadt</a>. In Utrecht, we walked along the Oude and Nieuwe Gracht.</li><li><em>Bring snacks/food and water.</em> See above: train delays <strong>will</strong> occur. Therefore, always have water and some snacks on you. M√ºsli bars, some nice bread rolls, nuts, whatever. Don&rsquo;t bring chocolate, it might melt.</li><li><em>Print out all the tickets</em>. I did get all the 15 different apps for the 10 different inter-European train agencies, but to be honest, I still felt safer printing out all the tickets and bringing them with me. The evening before I take out the tickets for tomorrow&rsquo;s train, check the time again, and put the print-out in the front pocket of my bagpack. Then during the train ride, I can use it as a bookmark, note down interesting things to see or restaurants to go to in the next destination, and have it handy when/if the train conductor comes (Which so far has not happened! No one has checked any of our tickets so far!).</li><li><em>One luggage person, one dog person.</em> I took a small wheely suitcase and a bagpack, and Duncan took a duffle bag and a bagpack. And then there&rsquo;s Laika. In hindsight it would&rsquo;ve been much smarter to put all our stuff into <strong>one</strong> (larger?) wheely suitcase. One person takes the suitcase, gets it on the train and stows it away. The other person takes the dog. Sometimes doggo needs to be carried into the train (many people, large gaps/steps) and having additional luggage is really annoying. Duncan ended up taking the duffle AND the suitcase, which is fine for a bit, but next time we&rsquo;ll pool.</li><li><em>The biggest cities are not always the best to stop</em>. We already learned this during planning when the hotel prices in Copenhagen were SO much higher than in 2-hours-further-South Kolding. But also Hamburg was a bit too stressful for my liking. The station is disgusting and a mess, and the way to the hostel was quite unpleasant as well. In contrast, Osnabr√ºck was a chill little town with a nice, walkable centre. The other advantage of getting on the train a bit away from the transport hubs is that the train stations are calmer.</li><li><em>RESERVE SEATS!!!</em> Can&rsquo;t stress this enough. I would <strong>never</strong> attempt a trans-European train travel without seat reservations. An exception are maybe commuter trains that run every 15-30 min.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#w17-2023><h2 id=w17-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w17 2023</h2></a><ul><li>The Netherlands produces an astonishing amount of food, both vegetables and meat. Here&rsquo;s an article that portrays the scale of it, and describes how it runs actually very energy- and resource-efficiently (or as good as possible):

From work I have a lot of recordings of fermentation pH and temperature values over time, and most of them are in huge Excel sheets and it&rsquo;s a pain to analyse by hand. But I&rsquo;m always in this dilemma that my datasets are still small enough to be able to do it by hand, and it&rsquo;s usually faster than sitting down and trying to figure out how to program a pipeline for analysis, that would make things quicker in the long run. Anyway, I finally had some time and watched a few Youtube videos about pandas, and followed some tutorials about [Matplotlib](
<a href=https://matplotlib.org/ rel=noopener>https://matplotlib.org/</a>. And - tataaa - I have now sucessfully created a Jupyter notebook with a pipeline that cleanes up my data, calculates some essential things, and then creates a nice graph. It still needs some improvements, like some loops over iterative file names, but in general I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I managed to produce something useful.

It was recommended somewhere, and I saw it in the library a few weeks ago and just took it. I expected more fantasy elements; it&rsquo;s essentially a family and clan saga about mafia structures in a tropical, Shanghai-y/Hongkong-y island nation. Yes, they get certain powers by being in contact with jade, but that&rsquo;s basically all that is different from the real world. If you substitute <em>jade</em> with <em>drugs</em> it would just be a gangster/mafia stroy. There&rsquo;s lots of underground trading logistics, street fighting, fulfilling family traditions, rivalry, etc. I did enjoy reading it, because the characters and the story were described in a very vivid way, but I won&rsquo;t read the rest of the trilogy. Too much other stuff to read.</p></li><li><p>While reading Jade City, I got a bit annoyed - as I do ocassionally with other stories about &ldquo;alternative realities&rdquo; - that the power structures in the fictional nation were quite similar to existing power structures in the real world. Like, why don&rsquo;t authors paint more diverse visions of fictional societies, but instead always fall back to the common &ldquo;men are in power, women are not as well regarded, foreigners are suspicious&rdquo; bla bla bla. It&rsquo;s so tiring. Same in Jade City, where one of the few main female characters is an incredibly talented jade fighter, but there is constantly this undercurrent of her not being taken seriously, having to convince people much more than her brothers, not being considered for certain roles because she&rsquo;s a woman, etc. However, at the end of the book there was actually an interview with the author, explaining that this setting was deliberate to make it seem more realistic and relatable, instead of creating a <em>complete</em> fantasy-world. I can understand that, though I would generally really appreciate more escapism in novels and descriptions of worlds that are a bit more diverse - in whatever way - than our current one. Isn&rsquo;t the whole point of making up fictional worlds that you can think up different ways of how things are run?</p></li><li><p>A good summary of

<a href=/digitalgarden/trips/SL2-Nord-till-syd/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/trips/SL2-Nord-till-syd/>SL2 Nord till syd</a>. It was not only a nice walk, but I also learned a lot about the history of Sk√•ne and the areas we walked through, observed trees, birds and insects, visited the geographical centre of Sk√•ne and the location of Sweden&rsquo;s oldest settlement, and got to know several new mid-sized towns (H√§ssleholm, H√∂√∂r, H√∂rby).</li></ul><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2060%20of%20123.jpeg width=400 alt=|400></p><a href=#w12-2023><h2 id=w12-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w12 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Finished watching <strong>The Last of Us</strong>. I thought it was excellently made. The way it keeps you on your toes, without being <em>too</em> graphic or scary most of the time. And the way it has calm epidoses in between the faster ones. It was actually much more slow-paced than I had expected, but that makes the fast scenes even more exciting and important. Something I have problems with in newer Star Trek series, like Discovery: there&rsquo;s no time to take a breath, every single incident is threatening the whole of the universe, etc. You just get tired of the high stakes and everything becomes a bit meaningless. Thankfully, they manage to get to a better balance (and better storytelling) again in the newest (third) <strong>Picard</strong> season - it&rsquo;s really good! I&rsquo;m halfway through the season.</li><li>Also started watching the BBC show <strong>Race Across the World</strong>. I LOVED season 1. During the midst of the pandemic in 2020, I was really craving pictures and impressions from other countries and cultures, and it was so nice to follow 5 teams as they make their way over land (and sea) from London, via Greece and Central Asia, to China, Vietnam and finally Singapore. It was varied, both in terms of transport, nature and culture. Season 2 was North to South from Mexico City to Ushuaia, and it was also good but a looot of bus travel, since that&rsquo;s the only mode of public transport available in a lot of places in Central and South America. So we&rsquo;ll see how season 3 plays out now, where the teams travel from Vancouver to St. John&rsquo;s on Newfoundland, via Yukon and Northern Manitoba. So far, car sharing seems to be <em>the</em> way to go in Canda, at least in the part where they&rsquo;re starting from. The nature is amazing, of course. It somewhat scratches my travel itch, but it also makes me long to go to all of these places.</li><li>Inspired by Race Across the World, I read about <strong>Haida Gwaii</strong> and found several interesting documentaries I want to watch:
<a href=https://vimeo.com/ondemand/haidagwaii rel=noopener>Haida Gwaii: On the Edge of the World</a>,

There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavrious, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.</p></blockquote><p>Crown shyness observed in Dalby S√∂derskog:

Partly to reactivate a little dataviz project that I&rsquo;m working on, partly because I also need it for work, and partly because I am of course interested in all things fermentation. The Lactobacillus genus recently went through a reorganization of the taxonomy, and there&rsquo;s a great
<a href=https://youtu.be/ErQbie690po rel=noopener>video/seminar</a> (by The Fermentation Association) with one of the authors about why it was done and what the new genera are.</li><li>For a while, <strong>One Hundred Years of Solitude</strong> by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez has been on my to-read list. So I got the audiobook (in German) and started, but after about 6 hours of listening I have to say that it&rsquo;s just not for me (and I decided to skip the remaining 12 hours). It&rsquo;s a nice evocative language and I do like the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism rel=noopener>magical realism</a> style. But every other person is called Jos√© or Arcadio Buendia (which just makes everything unnecessarily tedious to follow), and the story just trickles along without any build-up to anything, and there&rsquo;s some yucky marrying children stuff going on, and in general I just got incredibly bored by the whole thing. Not how I want to spend my time, when there&rsquo;s so many other great books to read. The historical background of South America in the 19th and early 20th century would have been interesting, but it was impossible to know what was actual and what was fictional.</li><li>One book that I did enjoy a lot was <strong>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</strong> (great title!). I saw it being described as &ldquo;cosy core&rdquo;, and I like that. It&rsquo;s futuristic, utopian, solar punk, but very gentle and connected to nature. The main character is a tea monk, travelling around to find a purpose, and meeting a robot on the way. Best to read with a steaming cup of tea on the side. üçµ</li></ul><a href=#w7-2023><h2 id=w7-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w7 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Started watching <strong>The Last of Us</strong> about escaping the zombie pandemic caused by a filamentous fungi (the creepy

It&rsquo;s just <em>impossible</em> to get anything bulkier than 2 layers under the buttonhole presserfoot.

And a lot of people are hoping that fungi can be found that can &ldquo;eat up&rdquo; plastic on land and in the ocean. Prompted by the question in the Future Ecologies Discord channel if there are any large-scale projects going on in that area, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole:
<a href=/digitalgarden/fungi/Bioremediation-with-fungi/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/fungi/Bioremediation-with-fungi/>Bioremediation with fungi</a>. In short, there are loads of studies that show that some fungal strain can degrade a particular, isolated plastic in a specific form (often soluble), at a specific concentration under specific conditions (often with the pH and temperature adjusted and necessary trace elements added). The problem with a real life application is that plastics are very resistant to chemical (and therefore also enzymatic) attack, usually come mixed together with other polymers, are found in difficult environments (ocean, landfills) with or without oxygen, etc. Preparing the substrate in a way that the fungi will just gobble it up, is tricky and costly. Another (in most papers unanswered) question is if the breakdown products are actually less harmful in the environment than the plastic polymer. Will fungal degradation release e.g. plasticizers that then leak into waterways? Will the fungi themselves become toxic? (There is this idea that oyster mushroom could grow on trash and then be eaten - is that healthy?) Fungi also release CO2 and throught he plastic degradation also potentially methane and other substances - is that better or worse for the environment than leaving the carbon more sequestered as a polymer?</li><li>On the weekend we went with Laika to a <strong>dog bakery</strong> in Gothenburg. It was ridiculous and wonderful. I had red velvet cake for the first time and was a bit disappointed. It looks more impressive than it tastes.

(I know, so 2011&mldr;) It was organised by
<a href=https://foocafe.org/ rel=noopener>Foo Caf√©</a> in Malm√∂ and was about protein folding and the new algorithms that have popped up and become publicly available over the last two years:

We were a nice little crowd of about 10 people, working from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, with some of us (including me) going home to sleep, and some actually doing the whole 24h. My team tried to improve the sweetness of the protein brazzein by using a combination of MPNN, Alphafold, EMSfold, Inpainting and Pymol.</li></ul><a href=#w3-2023><h2 id=w3-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w3 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Tried to make vegan
<a href=https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/ rel=noopener>tamagoyaki</a> with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn&rsquo;t find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam rel=noopener>uttapam</a>). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but
<a href=https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/ rel=noopener>this one here</a>uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn&rsquo;t turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I&rsquo;ve only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian).</li><li>Finally managed to get all my self-made clothes from the last 3 (?) years out on the bed, try them on and take pictures of myself.

I made two separate maps so far, one for Bergslagsleden and one for √Öhus-Karlskrona, with all the restaurants, supermarkets and hostels along the way in different colours.
