Baohong at work brought some Chinese sweets to celebrate.</li><li>Tuesday was Fettisdagen/Faschingsdienstag/Shrove Tuesday, which in Sweden of course means semla. I had pre-ordered a semla at our local bakery Farina, but just when I wanted to pick it up I got a text that their booking system had messed up and I wouldn&rsquo;t get my semla today (but could pick up a free one any other day in the next 2 weeks). To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t too sad about it because semlor are quite rich and creamy and I wasn&rsquo;t in the mood for that on Tuesday evening. So I&rsquo;m still looking forward to my yearly semla. I&rsquo;ll report back next week.</li><li>Yesterday was the first sunny day in a weeks filled with dreary grey sky, rain and wind. What a difference! We had &ldquo;maintenance day&rdquo; planned, a quarterly day where we fix things in the apartment. I repotted some plants, we put non-slippy things on the carpets and felt-things on the scratchy chair legs, Duncan sharpened the knives, and I cleaned all the windows. We also semi-successfully tried to beat the carpets and mattress on the balcony.</li><li><strong>Grandaddy&rsquo;s Blue Wav</strong> album was released this week, and it&rsquo;s of course lovely 游눗 Quite heart-breaky and melancholic, but very sweet.</li><li>We went to see <strong>Alessandro Cortini</strong> in Inkonst on Friday - synth music in a dark room with cool visuals. The bass was <em>insane</em>, I&rsquo;ve never felt music that much. At times I was wondering if it was still healthy. Not the volume, but the amount of vibration that I felt in my whole body. Quite an experience.</li><li>I ordered 120 L of gardening soil for my upcoming balcony project. I&rsquo;ve been collecting inspiration and information about what to grow and how, e.g. here:
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/plants/General-balcony-gardening-tips/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/plants/General-balcony-gardening-tips/>General balcony gardening tips</a>,
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/plants/Inspiration-pictures/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/plants/Inspiration-pictures/>Inspiration pictures</a>, and
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/plants/Plans-2024/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/plants/Plans-2024/>Plans 2024</a>. I got the soil delivered from Bauhaus, because I didn&rsquo;t want to drag it halfway across the city on a bus.</li><li>Today it&rsquo;s
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/fermentation/Kimchi/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/fermentation/Kimchi/>Kimchi</a>-making day with Anna.</li></ul><a href=#w6-2024><h2 id=w6-2024><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w6 2024</h2></a><ul><li>I went to the cinema again for the first time since before the pandemic! It was very nice. Went with my friend Anna to see <strong>Perfect Days</strong>, a Wim Wenders movie about a public toilet cleaner in Tokyo. Calm and slow, almost meditative.</li><li>We saw a music and light show in St. Pauli church in Malm칬. The music was described as &ldquo;deep house techno ambient undervattenk칛nsla&rdquo;. It lasted 50 min and I got into a nice state of calmness and reflection. I thought about the benefit of being &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to sit with yourself and your thoughts for an hour, and that religion and church services - if I have <em>anything</em> good to say about them - can provide that.</li><li>My woodcraft course started, after it had to be postpones by a week because of a &ldquo;blizzard&rdquo;. I learned how to use table saw, mitre saws and drill press, how to join corners and insert splines, how to measure things well, how to rip and cut wood, etc. It&rsquo;s fun and we are a very nice small group of people.</li><li>For Stefan and Stephan Stefan&rsquo;s 40th birthday party I went to Austria. I booked a capsule in the 칐BB Nightjet capsule wagons and really enjoyed it. The only downside really was the cold air ventilation that robbed me of my sleep on the way to Vienna. On the way back I wore my jacket the whole night and was very cosy. Vienna was spring-like with up to 14 c and sunshine. Was nice to see old friends - Martina, Stephan, Stefan, Michi, Teresa, Berntsch, Lebi - even though it felt a bit stiff and school reunion-like at times. Mama, Papa and Luna came also, and we had lunch and coffee with Tante Irmi and Onkel Bertram (who had just fallen down the stairs a few days earlier and had his head wrapped in gauze).</li><li>With Angie I went to Gartenbaukino and saw <strong>Poor Things</strong>. Crazy, lots of explicit sex scenes, and surprisingly fun.</li><li>Finished reading <strong>Craig Mod&rsquo;s
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/Things-Become-Other-Things/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/books/Things-Become-Other-Things/>Things Become Other Things</a></strong>. Loved the mix of autobiography, descriptions of Japan and the beautiful photos. Really a work of art this book. I read it slowly over a few weeks to really enjoy it and not race through (though you <em>could</em> read it in 2h). It made me REALLY want to go on a multi-day walk again this spring, but not sure if we can fit it into our schedule with work and family visits and the Gothenburg apartment sale.</li></ul><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//private/attachments/capsule%2003.jpg width=400 alt=|400></p><a href=#w3-2024><h2 id=w3-2024><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w3 2024</h2></a><ul><li>I got a haircut! I have a <strong>fringe</strong> now, and a mid-parting. My millenial self has to be strong not to swipe the hair to the side again. Slowly getting used to the look and the feeling of hair constantly hanging just above my eyes. But I thought it&rsquo;s nice with a change sometimes.</li><li>Moving to Sk친ne, and especially Southern Sk친ne, I really expected to not see snow in the winter at all. But this year so far has been kind to me. When we moved to Malm칬 in November, I made a bet with Duncan walking past the lake in Pildammsparken that it will never completely freeze over. Already a few weeks later I was proven wrong because we had a period with snow and freezing temperatures. Then over Christmas it was warm and wet again, but almost the whole of January now has been below 0 and on-and-off snow. There were even a few dramatic scenes on motorways nearby where people were stuck in a blizzard for a day, and my first woodworking class was cancelled because of too much snowfall.</li><li>Speaking of <strong>woodworking</strong>. I signed up for the beginner&rsquo;s class at
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=RefabLab>https://www.refablab.com/</a>. Partly because I just want to meet people here, and partly because I miss pottering around in a workshop. I also got an afternoon of pottery class for Christmas from Duncan. He&rsquo;s already very well integrated into some things here in Malm칬 due to the modular synthesizer community here, but I still need to find some connections. Sports clubs are not so my thing, even though playing in a team is probably the quickest way to make some close connections. I&rsquo;ll see if there is anything around crafting, fermentation, walking/hiking, gardening, refurbishing, etc. out there. Malm칬 seems to be a city with a lot of different initatives - people that just try and start something; that feels nice.</li><li>Angie was here for a long weekend and it was fun to show her around. We ate Bento boxes at Mitt M칬llan, had nice coffee at Caf칠 Jesusbaren, walked along the snowy beach, went shopping (incl. in the dozens of second hand shops here), looked at Konsthall, etc.

In summer we bought a bright red electric guitar (Stratocaster-like?) on Tradera and first I tried JustinGuitar&rsquo;s app for learning. It was good and his teaching style is great, but somehow I didn&rsquo;t get hooked. Then I tried Yousician, and I LOVE it! It&rsquo;s much more gamified, bascially GuitarHero with some exercises in between. But it&rsquo;s so much fun to play along songs and get an immediate feedback how good you were, etc. Unfortunately I hurt my finger somehow a few weeks ago, probably Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and it&rsquo;s been burning and unpleasant ever since. Resting the hand over Christmas didn&rsquo;t do much, so I just started gently playing again. I warm up my hand now before every session with a squeezy ball, and that seems to help. Or it&rsquo;s just that the healing process takes longer than expected. I want to play some Interpol and Strokes and Muse, and maybe also post-rock kind of stuff like Radio Dept.</li><li>New Year feels already like so long ago&mldr; We spent a week in <strong>Skillingaryd</strong> in Sm친land, far away from the fireworks craziness of M칬llev친ngstorget. Two days were very soggy, the other days were nice and snowy. Laika had a bad belly on the 29th, Duncan had a MASSIVE migraine on the 30th (likely partially caused by getting up several times in the night because of Laika), but on the 31st everyone was well again. We cooked noodle soup and watched The Big Fat Quiz of the Year on Youtube, an episode of Scavenger&rsquo;s Reign, and played a few Nanograms. Extremely chill New Year&rsquo;s eve. The train ride back home was calm and pleasant, very different from the train ride to Skillingaryd where I was trying to contain a Laika shaking with adrenalin for 2 hours because we shared the seats with two cats in carriers.
<img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//private/attachments/IMG_20240101_094139.jpg width=400 alt=|400></li><li>I tried some lino cut.</li><li>Started listening to <strong>Flashback Forever</strong> podcast. Mostly to train my Swedish, and I also like the Gothenburg accent of the hosts. Lots of LOLs. I&rsquo;ve also watched <strong>Love is Blind Sverige</strong>, which was pretty awful and cringy. <strong>The Expanse</strong> continues to be excellent, I&rsquo;m on season 3 now. I also started reading <strong>Jag 츿r Zlatan</strong> to both practice Swedish and learn more about Malm칬&rsquo;s famous son. I&rsquo;m one chapter in, where he basically only rants about how he is so awesome and his Spanish coach doesn&rsquo;t see that.</li></ul><a href=#w50-2023><h2 id=w50-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w50 2023</h2></a><ul><li>It&rsquo;s been a while! We&rsquo;ve mostly been busy with moving and settling in our new home in Malm칬. We love it here so far: very nice area (M칬llev친ngen), cool stuff to do, great restaurants, nice parks nearby (Pildammsparken, Folkets Park). We already know some nice people here, hang out with our neighbours who have a small Samoyed puppy, I signed up for Friskis gym and woodworking classes, we already went to several music gigs, etc.</li><li>I just tested positive for the big C :( I managed to avoid it for 3 years, and now caught it probably at the Christmas party a few days ago. Don&rsquo;t feel toooo bad. During the night I felt quite feverish, but now I&rsquo;m just a bit drowsy and have a sore throat.</li><li>It snowed here properly a few weeks ago! In Malm칬! Didn&rsquo;t think that would happen, let alone in November. We went out at 11 pm and walked around the park. The snow was SO soft and fluffy and gorgeous, omg. It lasted for about a week, because it was consistently below -5C. But now it&rsquo;s back to Sk친ne winter of 4C and drizzle.</li><li>Started watching <strong>The Expanse</strong> after consulting Reddit if I should read the books first or watch the TV show. Reddit was very split, but what convinced me to start watching was a comment that there are many good sci-fi books out there, but not that many really great sci-fi TV shows. And so far I love it! It feels the most realistic sci-fi I&rsquo;ve watched (ever?). Starting on Season 2 today, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being ill is for! There was one thing in particular that I remember from one early episode from the first season, where a guy from the Belt and from Earth have a discussion, and the Belter asks something like &ldquo;Why the hell did you ever leave Earth? To have the SKY above you, you breathe fresh AIR, you feel real RAIN instead of being locked up in a habitation hub!&rdquo;. And it made me think of the Mars colonisation bullshit that dickheads like Musk are trying to make a thing. Years ago I was fascinated by it because I like(d) all things space, but realising how we so incredibly stupidly destroy the Earth, and then as a solution it&rsquo;s suggested to colonise and geoengineer Mars?!?!! What the actual fuck.</li><li>We also started with <strong>Welcome to Wrexham</strong>, about the Welsh football club that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought. It&rsquo;s surprisingly heartwarming and makes me almost want to be really into football.</li><li>Books I&rsquo;ve read lately:<ul><li><strong>How big things get done</strong>* (Bent Flyvbjerg). Bit repetitive, as most non-fiction books that want to &ldquo;get a point across&rdquo;, but still enjoyable and interesting. In short, more planning and more buffer (both time and money) would make projects succeed better.</li><li><strong>Masala Lab: The science of Indian cooking</strong> (Krish Ashok). Had to stop a quarter through. The writing was insufferable. The author things he&rsquo;s funny, doesn&rsquo;t get to the point, talks things up to &ldquo;uuh, watch out, science!&rdquo; etc. Bah.</li><li><strong>A prayer for the crown-shy</strong> (Becky Chambers). Lovely, very similar to the first Monk & Robot book. I love her writing and the way she describes things. So evocative without being poetic or flowery or too much.</li><li><strong>The Immortalists</strong> (Chloe Benjamin). Got that one from the library on a whim. Ok story about some kids getting told their time of death and how their lives unfold thereafter. Some things are a bit ham-handed, and there&rsquo;s not really a tense story arc going on, but I still finished it. Somewhat forgettable though.</li><li><strong>All systems red</strong> (Martha Wells). First one of the Murderbot diaries. I started the second one and then realised that I should probably read the first one first. Nice original take on the whole human-androids-augments-robots thing, self-determinance, etc. Dry humour and still quite good sci-fi elements. Liked it. I just read that they&rsquo;re going to make an Apple TV show out of it starring Alexander Skarsg친rd, but in my mind the murderbot was always female&mldr;?</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#w38-2023><h2 id=w38-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w38 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Duncan got <strong>Covid</strong> after going to England and was pretty ill for a while. We (successfully?) quarantined and isolated at home, and I spent the last two weeks sleeping in the living room while he didn&rsquo;t really leave the bedroom. Now the trees outside are turning yellow, the air is getting crisp and his Covid tests are finally coming back negative again.</li><li>I fancied reading a book in German again, so I went to the library with my dad who visited a few weeks ago. I got <strong>&ldquo;F&rdquo; by Daniel Kehlmann</strong>, and I really enjoyed it. Particularly the hilariously accurate descriptions of the catholic church service - it really reminded me of my childhood.</li><li>I miss <strong>winter</strong> 仇勇. Moving to Southern Sweden, close to the coast, as well as climate change makes the winters I experience more and more snow-less. Here in Sk친ne winter is just dark, windy and wet, around 3C and perpetually overcast. Sometimes I lie in bed in the morning, when it&rsquo;s dark and my eyes are still closed, and I imagine being at home in Austria, 30 years ago, early morning, and just hear the &ldquo;kkschrrr, kksschrrr&rdquo; of someone shovelling snow in front of their house. And then I get incredibly nostalgic. I need to see and experience snow again this winter. Last winter we didn&rsquo;t go anywhere snowy and we had literally two mornings in Helsingborg where it was white on the ground (and gone by midday).</li><li>In preparation of a nice winter holiday, Duncan made something that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to make for ages:

The reason why you sometimes see wonky little raspberries that just consist of a few segments (druplet) is insufficient pollination. Basically every single druplet of a raspberry (or blackberry, etc.) is a fruit and had its own pistil that needed to be pollinated. A nice, full, mature raspberry has 100-200 druplets.</li></ul><a href=#w33-2023><h2 id=w33-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w33 2023</h2></a><ul><li>We&rsquo;ve had a <strong>Thermomix TM5</strong> now for a bit more than a month, thanks to my work having one old one &ldquo;left over&rdquo; that I could borrow. At first we only used it for a few things and it felt more like a hassle to try to integrate it into our cooking routines. But the past two weeks we&rsquo;ve been cooking almost exclusively Thermomix-specific recipes from the
<a href=https://cookidoo.international/foundation/en rel=noopener>Cookidoo</a> website, and I&rsquo;m starting to see the benefit of having this gadget in the kitchen. I particularly like it for starting a cooking process by just throwing in a whole onion, some garlic cloves and some spices and oil, and then letting it chop and simmer while you prepare other stuff. It definitely shines when you make things like stews and soups, or also risottos, where frequent stirring on a medium heat over longer time is desired. It&rsquo;s not the easiest thing to clean, so recipes with multiple &ldquo;chop, take out, clean, put in another ingredient&rdquo; cycles are a bit annoying. In
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/cooking/Thermomix-recipes/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/cooking/Thermomix-recipes/>Thermomix recipes</a> I have collected some of my favourite recipes so far and some that we are about to try.</li></ul><a href=#w32-2023><h2 id=w32-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w32 2023</h2></a><ul><li>So it looks like we have found an <strong>apartment in Malm칬</strong>! The Swedish rental market amazes/confuses me once again&mldr; So I have about 2 years of queueing points on different sites. Very occasionally an apartment has come up during the last 3ish months of searching that I kind of liked. I visited three (four, if you count the one where we were stuck on a train somewhere near K칛vlinge for an hour and missed the viewing): one was claustrophobic and above a heavy smoker, one was amazing but too expensive (though in hindsight we probably should have taken it) and one was cute, a bit oddly shaped and in a great location. For that last one we were on spot 19 when the viewing was taking place. During the viewing some people dropped out and I moved to spot 12. Over the next few days I first got to 9, then to 6. Still not much hope though. Then I was 3, and the message on Boplats said that they were checking the first one in queue for eligibility. Then I was 2, same message. And then during the end of last week I was on spot 1 and the message said that we might get it and that the housing organisation is checking our eligibility. WHAT? How did that happen? Yes, there is a strange little extra room that is half-attached to the living room. And the kitchen is fairly small. But other than that? What&rsquo;s wrong with the apartment? Or what&rsquo;s wrong with the other people in the queue ahead of me? Yes, there are some standard requirements, like not smoking anywhere in or near the building, earning at least twice the monthly rent, and some stranger ones like having a job that is less than 2h commute away. But still&mldr;? Well anyway, we got it! They&rsquo;ll send the contract in a few days! And I&rsquo;m excited and have been watching home styling videos all weekend. I&rsquo;m a bit sad to leave the considerably greener Helsingborg behind, but also chuffed about having a bit more lively city life again, meeting more people with similar interests, etc.</li><li>At work I&rsquo;ve been doing more <strong>lactic acid bacteria</strong> stuff. I spread some yogurt on selective plates to be able to determine how many live bacteria are in it at different points during shelf life. Looks pretty good, I counted about 10^9 per g product on day 1 and then there&rsquo;s a steady decline to about 10^7 after 3 months. A billion bacteria PER GRAM! And that&rsquo;s not even that much. It&rsquo;s always mind boggling how much life there is in <em>everything</em>.</li><li>I gave audiobooks another try after watching a compelling video about <strong><a href=https://youtu.be/yu-o0uOylDA rel=noopener>the best books of 2023 so far</a></strong>. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of 60ies sci-fi lately and fancied a bit more contemporary stuff. Instead of the dreaded Audible I tried Xig Xag, which has a different payment system (you pay per book) and is not tied to a subscription. They had <strong>Pod</strong> by Laline Paull, which had high marks. But after listening to it now for 3+ hours, I&rsquo;m not sure I want to continue. It&rsquo;s a bit boring and scattered. Lots of fish being nasty to each other.</li><li>In parallel I&rsquo;m also listening to <strong>Sommaren 1985</strong> by John Ajvide Linqvist, whose other books L친t den r칛tte komma in and M칛nniskohamn I absolutely loved. So far it&rsquo;s nice, but also more coming-of-age and less tense thriller than I&rsquo;d like. They found a creepy mermaid, so hopefully something develops there. I don&rsquo;t get <em>everything</em> of the Swedish, but enough to follow along. And it&rsquo;s very good practice.</li><li>The weather continues to be a bit dismal here in Sk친ne. While everywhere else is breaking records with either temperature (Hottest July ever! Hottest sea surface temperature ever!) or floodings or forest fires, Sk친ne continues to be windy and rainy at a more or less constant 13-16C. So it feels wrong to complain, but it would also be nice to have a few summery days. After the dreadful winter (windy, rainy) I&rsquo;m longing for some more distinct seasons.</li><li>I got my passport back! And I&rsquo;ve had the most Austrian interactions in a while with the people from the embassies (both in Stockholm and Copenhagen) - chill, jovial, slightly incompetent but well-meaning. A bit like
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/15ob4bd/trafik%c3%bcberfall_in_graz_mariatrost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" rel=noopener>this video</a> of a recent armed robbery in Graz.</li><li>There was some buzz about an apparent room-temperature superconductor from a Korean lab. Besides the fact that it was only published on arXiv and no one has managed to replicate it yet&mldr; Why are people SO excited about it? Woah, we can build maglev trains now! Well, we can already build <em>normal</em> trains now that are fast and efficient (if maintained properly). But still many countries and governments don&rsquo;t. This is a solved problem (on the technical side).</li></ul><a href=#w30-2023><h2 id=w30-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w30 2023</h2></a><ul><li>In week 29 I went to a Finnish town called <strong>Kouvola</strong> for a work trip, a 1.5 h drive from Helsinki. Lost my passport somewhere on the way there. Otherwise the trip was good, even though on the first day it looked like we had come for nothing because one pump in the factory didn&rsquo;t work. But the pump was fixed the next day and my colleague and I rebooked out flights to late on Wednesday, so we could finish the trial. It was an interesting experience going from a lab-made product to a factory scale - there are so many new challenges that I didn&rsquo;t anticipate. Mostly that there is water in all the pipes that needs to be pushed out before product can travel in them, thereby potentially diluting your recipe. And the all the loss at different stages, because the ends and starts of pumping product from tank A to tank B are usually discarded. Definitely some optimisation that could be done there.</li><li>Finished reading <strong>Story of Your Life and Others</strong> by Ted Chiang. Over the last year he&rsquo;s become one of my favourite writers. He just combined sci-fi and maths and history and philosophy in such a unique way. And I love the unusual settings, like a construction site of the tower of Babel or a industrial age factory with clay golems. I preferred his other short story collection
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/Exhalation/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/books/Exhalation/>Exhalation</a>, just because the stories seemed a bit more finished and self-contained there, but I really enjoyed it. My favourites were The Tower of Babel and Story of Your Life, which was the basis for the film Arrival.</li><li>Started learning <strong>bass</strong>, because Duncan is doing an online tutorial (and recently bought a bass second hand) and asked if I wanted to try a few lessons. It&rsquo;s fun to play an instrument again. Not sure if the bass is my thing though. I am not very good in even picking out the bassline in a song. I somehow feels like it&rsquo;s almost dispensable. And it&rsquo;s usually very repetitive to play. It doesn&rsquo;t have the same impact as the guitar it seems. But maybe that&rsquo;s just my newbie ignorance.</li><li>Apparently <strong>chicken-of-the-woods</strong> tastes more chicken than chicken itself (according to some dude on Reddit). That was enough to get me very intrigued. Now looking into if I can find it somewhere here in Sweden, or grow it. Is it possible to grow it in larger scale, like on sawdust? Or even submerged?</li><li>It was my <strong>birthday</strong>! I got a personalised Heinz ketchup bottle, a mini whisk and mini spatula to scrape out jam jars, the book &ldquo;How big things get done&rdquo;, a very nice green pair of Fairphone headphones, some golden iron-on patches to cover stains, and Korean BB cream. Duncan and I went to Chay, the amazing vegan Vietnamese place in town, bought some cakey treats at Bruket Kaffebar, then I cycled to the beach with Luciane and even went into the water twice (a refreshing 16C!), played some Zelda, read a bit, chatted with family, had meze for dinner and watched an episode of Strange New Worlds. Pretty much a perfect day.</li><li>The summer in Sweden has been a somewhat underwhelming so far (usually 12-28C and showers, windy, drizzly, overcast), but I can&rsquo;t really complain because other parts of the world are literally on fire and July was the hottest month <em>ever</em> in human history.</li></ul><a href=#w28-2023><h2 id=w28-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w28 2023</h2></a><ul><li>SO MUCH <strong>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. I&rsquo;m trying to not rush it because I want to explore every corner of the map first.</li><li>I finished reading <strong><a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/New-York-2140/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/books/New-York-2140/>New York 2140</a></strong>. I&rsquo;m glad I read it, because I like to read more somewhat realistic (and ideally utopian/solar punk) climate fiction. But I have to be honest and admit that I didn&rsquo;t really like it and wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it. Towards the end I skimmed entire pages because I got tired of characters just talking to each other while some of the (imo) more exciting plot lines were hung out to dry.
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/The-Ministry-for-the-Future/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/books/The-Ministry-for-the-Future/>The Ministry for the Future</a> is better, even though I would probably also criticise that there is too much filler conversation going on. My preference for writing styles is concise and saying a lot in a few sentences. Carefully crafted sentences, without sounding overly lyrical. Some examples that I read are anything Ursula K. LeGuin,
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/The-Mountain-in-the-Sea/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/books/The-Mountain-in-the-Sea/>The Mountain in the Sea</a>, or some Japanese writers like Banana Yoshimoto.</li><li>Bought some <strong>chayote</strong> and some <strong>green papaya</strong>, because they had it in my local Asian shop. I had never used green papaya myself, and never even heard of chayote. I fermented them (
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/fermentation/Chayote-plain-and-Jamaican-style/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/fermentation/Chayote-plain-and-Jamaican-style/>Chayote - plain and Jamaican-style</a>,
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/fermentation/Green-papaya-Thai-style/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/fermentation/Green-papaya-Thai-style/>Green papaya Thai-style</a>): The chayote kept its crunch nicely but doesn&rsquo;t really have any own flavour (both good and bad). The papaya is also crunchy while also having a slightly fruity note. Next up is a big green squash that I found in the Middle Eastern shop.</li><li>I made another <strong><a href=/digitalgarden/projects/sewing/Stacker-Jacket/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/sewing/Stacker-Jacket/>Stacker Jacket</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s so crazy to construct a lined jacket, especially at the stage where everything is inside out and sewn together with four sleeves sticking out in different directions. Then you just pull it all through a tiny hole in the lining and out comes a fancy jacket. I just have the buttons left to attach, and I&rsquo;m dreading it. The jacket looks perfect right now, I might mess it all up with the buttons and those damned buttonholes.</li><li>While having all the sewing stuff out, I also made a <strong><a href=/digitalgarden/projects/sewing/Donny-shirt/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/sewing/Donny-shirt/>Donny shirt</a></strong> from leftover linen fabric from my

Everyone online said it&rsquo;s &ldquo;such a quick sew!&rdquo; but it took me probably like 8-10 hours altogether. I re-watched <strong>Foundation season 1</strong> while sewing. Such a good show! And season 2 is coming out soon, which is why I wanted to refresh my memory.</li><li>Speaking of TV shows: <strong>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</strong> season 2 is also out now. We tried to watch the first episode the other day and realised we had no clue what actually happened in the last season. So we watched a recap video on Youtube. Now I feel better prepared and I&rsquo;m really excited to start watching because the first season was SO GOOD!</li></ul><a href=#w22-2023><h2 id=w22-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w22 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Some learnings from planning, booking and now being in the middle of a 3 week train travel through Europe (Sweden-Denmark-Germany-Netherlands-Belgium-Luxembourg-Germany-Austria-Germany-Sweden). With our dog 游냤.<ul><li><em>Don&rsquo;t chain trains.</em> Delays <strong>will</strong> occur. It&rsquo;s so much nicer, and less stressful to stop more frequently, only have a few hours of train travel each day, arrive in the next destination earlier in the day and have a chance to explore it a bit. Also, delays won&rsquo;t bother you if you don&rsquo;t have to catch another train. More time to read!</li><li><em>Don&rsquo;t be overly ambitious</em>. We usually left a place at around 10, that leaves time for a nice breakfast and morning walk. Then buy a snack, get on the train for a few hours. Dog sleeps, we read, listen, watch, chat, snooze, eat. Early afternoon, we arrive, walk to the hotel, drop off our stuff, rest a bit and then head out for exploring the city and look for a nice caf칠 or restaurant for early dinner.</li><li><em>Pick <strong>one</strong> thing to see in each place</em>. Even in the most boring seeming places, there is <em>something</em> to explore. It&rsquo;s good to look that thing up before you arrive, so the visits in the various places are not all just aimless wandering. It can be nice to aimlessly wander, but it also gets a bit tiring. For example in Kolding, we visited the model village
<a href=https://koldingminiby.dk/da_dk/ rel=noopener>Miniby</a> and the botanical garden around it. In Hamburg, we went to the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherstadt rel=noopener>Speicherstadt</a>. In Utrecht, we walked along the Oude and Nieuwe Gracht.</li><li><em>Bring snacks/food and water.</em> See above: train delays <strong>will</strong> occur. Therefore, always have water and some snacks on you. M칲sli bars, some nice bread rolls, nuts, whatever. Don&rsquo;t bring chocolate, it might melt.</li><li><em>Print out all the tickets</em>. I did get all the 15 different apps for the 10 different inter-European train agencies, but to be honest, I still felt safer printing out all the tickets and bringing them with me. The evening before I take out the tickets for tomorrow&rsquo;s train, check the time again, and put the print-out in the front pocket of my bagpack. Then during the train ride, I can use it as a bookmark, note down interesting things to see or restaurants to go to in the next destination, and have it handy when/if the train conductor comes (Which so far has not happened! No one has checked any of our tickets so far!).</li><li><em>One luggage person, one dog person.</em> I took a small wheely suitcase and a bagpack, and Duncan took a duffle bag and a bagpack. And then there&rsquo;s Laika. In hindsight it would&rsquo;ve been much smarter to put all our stuff into <strong>one</strong> (larger?) wheely suitcase. One person takes the suitcase, gets it on the train and stows it away. The other person takes the dog. Sometimes doggo needs to be carried into the train (many people, large gaps/steps) and having additional luggage is really annoying. Duncan ended up taking the duffle AND the suitcase, which is fine for a bit, but next time we&rsquo;ll pool.</li><li><em>The biggest cities are not always the best to stop</em>. We already learned this during planning when the hotel prices in Copenhagen were SO much higher than in 2-hours-further-South Kolding. But also Hamburg was a bit too stressful for my liking. The station is disgusting and a mess, and the way to the hostel was quite unpleasant as well. In contrast, Osnabr칲ck was a chill little town with a nice, walkable centre. The other advantage of getting on the train a bit away from the transport hubs is that the train stations are calmer.</li><li><em>RESERVE SEATS!!!</em> Can&rsquo;t stress this enough. I would <strong>never</strong> attempt a trans-European train travel without seat reservations. An exception are maybe commuter trains that run every 15-30 min.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#w17-2023><h2 id=w17-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w17 2023</h2></a><ul><li>The Netherlands produces an astonishing amount of food, both vegetables and meat.

From work I have a lot of recordings of fermentation pH and temperature values over time, and most of them are in huge Excel sheets and it&rsquo;s a pain to analyse by hand. But I&rsquo;m always in this dilemma that my datasets are still small enough to be able to do it by hand, and it&rsquo;s usually faster than sitting down and trying to figure out how to program a pipeline for analysis, that would make things quicker in the long run. Anyway, I finally had some time and watched a few Youtube videos about pandas, and followed some tutorials about [Matplotlib](
<a href=https://matplotlib.org/ rel=noopener>https://matplotlib.org/</a>. And - tataaa - I have now sucessfully created a Jupyter notebook with a pipeline that cleanes up my data, calculates some essential things, and then creates a nice graph. It still needs some improvements, like some loops over iterative file names, but in general I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I managed to produce something useful.

It was recommended somewhere, and I saw it in the library a few weeks ago and just took it. I expected more fantasy elements; it&rsquo;s essentially a family and clan saga about mafia structures in a tropical, Shanghai-y/Hongkong-y island nation. Yes, they get certain powers by being in contact with jade, but that&rsquo;s basically all that is different from the real world. If you substitute <em>jade</em> with <em>drugs</em> it would just be a gangster/mafia stroy. There&rsquo;s lots of underground trading logistics, street fighting, fulfilling family traditions, rivalry, etc. I did enjoy reading it, because the characters and the story were described in a very vivid way, but I won&rsquo;t read the rest of the trilogy. Too much other stuff to read.</p></li><li><p>While reading Jade City, I got a bit annoyed - as I do ocassionally with other stories about &ldquo;alternative realities&rdquo; - that the power structures in the fictional nation were quite similar to existing power structures in the real world. Like, why don&rsquo;t authors paint more diverse visions of fictional societies, but instead always fall back to the common &ldquo;men are in power, women are not as well regarded, foreigners are suspicious&rdquo; bla bla bla. It&rsquo;s so tiring. Same in Jade City, where one of the few main female characters is an incredibly talented jade fighter, but there is constantly this undercurrent of her not being taken seriously, having to convince people much more than her brothers, not being considered for certain roles because she&rsquo;s a woman, etc. However, at the end of the book there was actually an interview with the author, explaining that this setting was deliberate to make it seem more realistic and relatable, instead of creating a <em>complete</em> fantasy-world. I can understand that, though I would generally really appreciate more escapism in novels and descriptions of worlds that are a bit more diverse - in whatever way - than our current one. Isn&rsquo;t the whole point of making up fictional worlds that you can think up different ways of how things are run?</p></li><li><p>A good summary of

<a href=/digitalgarden/trips/SL2-Nord-till-syd/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/trips/SL2-Nord-till-syd/>SL2 Nord till syd</a>. It was not only a nice walk, but I also learned a lot about the history of Sk친ne and the areas we walked through, observed trees, birds and insects, visited the geographical centre of Sk친ne and the location of Sweden&rsquo;s oldest settlement, and got to know several new mid-sized towns (H칛ssleholm, H칬칬r, H칬rby).</li></ul><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2060%20of%20123.jpeg width=400 alt=|400></p><a href=#w12-2023><h2 id=w12-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w12 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Finished watching <strong>The Last of Us</strong>. I thought it was excellently made. The way it keeps you on your toes, without being <em>too</em> graphic or scary most of the time. And the way it has calm epidoses in between the faster ones. It was actually much more slow-paced than I had expected, but that makes the fast scenes even more exciting and important. Something I have problems with in newer Star Trek series, like Discovery: there&rsquo;s no time to take a breath, every single incident is threatening the whole of the universe, etc. You just get tired of the high stakes and everything becomes a bit meaningless. Thankfully, they manage to get to a better balance (and better storytelling) again in the newest (third) <strong>Picard</strong> season - it&rsquo;s really good! I&rsquo;m halfway through the season.</li><li>Also started watching the BBC show <strong>Race Across the World</strong>. I LOVED season 1. During the midst of the pandemic in 2020, I was really craving pictures and impressions from other countries and cultures, and it was so nice to follow 5 teams as they make their way over land (and sea) from London, via Greece and Central Asia, to China, Vietnam and finally Singapore. It was varied, both in terms of transport, nature and culture. Season 2 was North to South from Mexico City to Ushuaia, and it was also good but a looot of bus travel, since that&rsquo;s the only mode of public transport available in a lot of places in Central and South America. So we&rsquo;ll see how season 3 plays out now, where the teams travel from Vancouver to St. John&rsquo;s on Newfoundland, via Yukon and Northern Manitoba. So far, car sharing seems to be <em>the</em> way to go in Canda, at least in the part where they&rsquo;re starting from. The nature is amazing, of course. It somewhat scratches my travel itch, but it also makes me long to go to all of these places.</li><li>Inspired by Race Across the World, I read about <strong>Haida Gwaii</strong> and found several interesting documentaries I want to watch:

It&rsquo;s Europe&rsquo;s smallest National Park, and it is indeed tiny.

The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavrious, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.</p></blockquote><p>Crown shyness observed in Dalby S칬derskog:

This sounds very exciting! I&rsquo;m already dreaming of travelling without a bad conscience in planes that sprinkle water droplets out of their engines.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve been reading (and really enjoying) <strong><a href=/digitalgarden/projects/books/The-Mountain-in-the-Sea/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/books/The-Mountain-in-the-Sea/>The Mountain in the Sea</a></strong> lately, and <strong>connectomes</strong> and brain mappings are a central part of the plot. Interesting (and somewhat scary?) that the real world is catching up: The brain of a 6 hour old Drosphila fly has been mapped and a connectome created (
<a href=https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel rel=noopener>article in Nature</a>).

<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/science/Lactic-acid-bacteria/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/science/Lactic-acid-bacteria/>Lactic acid bacteria</a> lately. Partly to reactivate a little dataviz project that I&rsquo;m working on, partly because I also need it for work, and partly because I am of course interested in all things fermentation. The Lactobacillus genus recently went through a reorganization of the taxonomy, and there&rsquo;s a great
<a href=https://youtu.be/ErQbie690po rel=noopener>video/seminar</a> (by The Fermentation Association) with one of the authors about why it was done and what the new genera are.</li><li>For a while, <strong>One Hundred Years of Solitude</strong> by Gabriel Garc칤a M치rquez has been on my to-read list. So I got the audiobook (in German) and started, but after about 6 hours of listening I have to say that it&rsquo;s just not for me (and I decided to skip the remaining 12 hours). It&rsquo;s a nice evocative language and I do like the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism rel=noopener>magical realism</a> style. But every other person is called Jos칠 or Arcadio Buendia (which just makes everything unnecessarily tedious to follow), and the story just trickles along without any build-up to anything, and there&rsquo;s some yucky marrying children stuff going on, and in general I just got incredibly bored by the whole thing. Not how I want to spend my time, when there&rsquo;s so many other great books to read. The historical background of South America in the 19th and early 20th century would have been interesting, but it was impossible to know what was actual and what was fictional.</li><li>One book that I did enjoy a lot was <strong>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</strong> (great title!). I saw it being described as &ldquo;cosy core&rdquo;, and I like that. It&rsquo;s futuristic, utopian, solar punk, but very gentle and connected to nature. The main character is a tea monk, travelling around to find a purpose, and meeting a robot on the way. Best to read with a steaming cup of tea on the side. 游꼿</li></ul><a href=#w7-2023><h2 id=w7-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w7 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Started watching <strong>The Last of Us</strong> about escaping the zombie pandemic caused by a filamentous fungi (the creepy
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps?useskin=vector" rel=noopener>Cordyceps</a> that replaces host tissue with mycelium). I really enjoy it, especially the video-gamey scenes, like when one of the protagonists snipes at hordes of zombies from a high-rise so that his friends can reach a safe zone.</li><li>We finally decided on where to walk for this year&rsquo;s Easter Hike (this is becoming a tradition after <a class="internal-link broken">Gotaleden</a> in 2021 and
<a href=/digitalgarden/trips/Kullaleden/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/trips/Kullaleden/>Kullaleden</a> in 2022). It&rsquo;s going to be part of
<a href=/digitalgarden/trips/Sk%C3%A5neleden/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/trips/Sk%C3%A5neleden/>Sk친neleden</a>, the Northern half of the North-to-South route, 133 km from Vittsj칬 to H칬rby.</li><li>I finished my

They look great and it was a very satisfying project, as the pattern is very precise and has some nice sharp corners, and the Youtube tutorial is top notch. I&rsquo;m already living in these trousers. 游녰 The only annoying thing was - as usual - the buttonhole. It&rsquo;s just <em>impossible</em> to get anything bulkier than 2 layers under the buttonhole presserfoot. In the end I did the buttonhole &ldquo;manually&rdquo; by sewing two narrow rows of zig-zag stitching and connected them with a wider stitch.</li></ul><a href=#w5-2023><h2 id=w5-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w5 2023</h2></a><ul><li><strong>Mycoremediation</strong> - cleaning the environment with fungi - seems very appealing. And a lot of people are hoping that fungi can be found that can &ldquo;eat up&rdquo; plastic on land and in the ocean. Prompted by the question in the Future Ecologies Discord channel if there are any large-scale projects going on in that area, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole:
<a href=/digitalgarden/fungi/Bioremediation-with-fungi/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/fungi/Bioremediation-with-fungi/>Bioremediation with fungi</a>. In short, there are loads of studies that show that some fungal strain can degrade a particular, isolated plastic in a specific form (often soluble), at a specific concentration under specific conditions (often with the pH and temperature adjusted and necessary trace elements added). The problem with a real life application is that plastics are very resistant to chemical (and therefore also enzymatic) attack, usually come mixed together with other polymers, are found in difficult environments (ocean, landfills) with or without oxygen, etc. Preparing the substrate in a way that the fungi will just gobble it up, is tricky and costly. Another (in most papers unanswered) question is if the breakdown products are actually less harmful in the environment than the plastic polymer. Will fungal degradation release e.g. plasticizers that then leak into waterways? Will the fungi themselves become toxic? (There is this idea that oyster mushroom could grow on trash and then be eaten - is that healthy?) Fungi also release CO2 and throught he plastic degradation also potentially methane and other substances - is that better or worse for the environment than leaving the carbon more sequestered as a polymer?</li><li>On the weekend we went with Laika to a <strong>dog bakery</strong> in Gothenburg. It was ridiculous and wonderful. I had red velvet cake for the first time and was a bit disappointed. It looks more impressive than it tastes. Or maybe a dog bakery is not the best place to evaluate cakes for humans?</li></ul><a href=#w4-2023><h2 id=w4-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w4 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Really enjoying the

(I know, so 2011&mldr;) It was organised by
<a href=https://foocafe.org/ rel=noopener>Foo Caf칠</a> in Malm칬 and was about protein folding and the new algorithms that have popped up and become publicly available over the last two years:
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/coding/AlphaFold/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/coding/AlphaFold/>AlphaFold</a>,
<a href=https://esmatlas.com/ rel=noopener>ESMfold</a>, Rosettafold, etc. The workshop leader was Amijai Saragovi, a Postdoc in the Baker lab in Seattle. (Here are the
<a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12SgqOSQw7aRS5qEVr360O8BdChmJv0Ng rel=noopener>seminar notes</a>) I&rsquo;ve been meaning to look into this stuff a bit more for a while anyway, so it was a good opportunity to be &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to do that. We were a nice little crowd of about 10 people, working from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, with some of us (including me) going home to sleep, and some actually doing the whole 24h. My team tried to improve the sweetness of the protein brazzein by using a combination of MPNN, Alphafold, EMSfold, Inpainting and Pymol.</li></ul><a href=#w3-2023><h2 id=w3-2023><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>w3 2023</h2></a><ul><li>Tried to make vegan
<a href=https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/ rel=noopener>tamagoyaki</a> with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn&rsquo;t find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam rel=noopener>uttapam</a>). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but
<a href=https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/ rel=noopener>this one here</a>uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn&rsquo;t turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I&rsquo;ve only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian).</li><li>Finally managed to get all my self-made clothes from the last 3 (?) years out on the bed, try them on and take pictures of myself. Started to catalogue them
<a href=/digitalgarden/projects/sewing/Made-from-scratch/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/digitalgarden/projects/sewing/Made-from-scratch/>here</a>.</li><li>A good way to scope out which hiking routes offer sufficient accomodation and food opportunities along the way is to download the .gpx file of a route (often from alltrails, e.g.
<a href=https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/orebro--2/bergslagsleden%29 rel=noopener>https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/orebro--2/bergslagsleden)</a>, then going to
<a href=https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ rel=noopener>https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/</a> and importing that file. Then in different layers and with different colours, things can be added. I made two separate maps so far, one for Bergslagsleden and one for 칀hus-Karlskrona, with all the restaurants, supermarkets and hostels along the way in different colours.
