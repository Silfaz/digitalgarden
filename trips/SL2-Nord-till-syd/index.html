Started on Wednesday, finished on Easter Sunday (= 5 days).

Vittsj칬 is tiny, but has a small supermarket, which wasn&rsquo;t the case for many other places we came through. But with our backpacks full of food anyway, we quickly turned into the forest. Laika was SO happy to be in the forest again, full on zoomies.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2011%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2014%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>Some puddles along the way were still frozen. We came past some small farms with friendly and curious horses and some ruins of old mills. The forest was a mix of calming pine forest with thick moss covers, and almost autumnal-looking beech and oak forests. We only stopped briefly for lunch, because as soon as we stopped we cooled down quite quickly. Maximum temperature on day 1 was around 5 췈C. The ground was at different times saturated with water and a bit muddy.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2019%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2023%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>At Aggarps skola, we climbed a steep hill with many boulders and then walked along a ridge towards H친gnarp, and then down towards Vedema with its many walking paths.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2036%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2037%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2042%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>We passed some sad-looking farm ruins at Jontustorp and then left Sk친neleden to reach our first destination, H칬rlinge Guesthouse. The house was big and a bit cold. We cooked some dinner (tacos with re-hydrated soy-mince and sliced apples), watched an episode of Star Trek Voyager, had a shower, then cuddled up in bed and immediately fell asleep.</p><a href=#day-2-h칬rlinge---h칛ssleholm><h3 id=day-2-h칬rlinge---h칛ssleholm><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Day 2: H칬rlinge - H칛ssleholm</h3></a><p>We woke to some snow on the ground, -2췈C and sunshine.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2047%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>Back on Sk친neleden, we walked along a magical little forest trail, the snow twinkling in the sun, meltwater dripping from the trees, birds singing. We had a little lie-down on the moss, because it looked so inviting.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2060%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>Nearing Finja, we had to cross a busy highway-like road, then find our way through some swamp area with barbed wire, then walk a kilometer along the busy road again with trucks and cars thundering past. Definitely the least pleasant part of the whole walk. We were glad when the path took us away from it again. We entered the area around Finjasj칬n and had lunchbreak in a wetland area on a beautifully situated but somewhat rotten wooden platform.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2065%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>We walked past the oldest known human settlement in Sweden (
<a href="https://www.google.se/maps/place/Sweden%27s+oldest+settlement/@56.1630026,13.6941526,16.37z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x465157fd956d1d5f:0xdd32decfcdfb7edd!8m2!3d56.1621371!4d13.6968996!16s%2Fg%2F11fx7s0f50?hl=en" rel=noopener>Sveriges 칛ldsta boplats</a>; 14000 years ago), then had to backtrack a bit because our path was completely flooded. That happened a few more times on the track around Finjasj칬n, which has a large wetland area on its Northern shore.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2070%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>We reached H칛ssleholm and had some restorative cake and iced coffee in Espresso House, before we got into our second accomodation, Kronans B&B. The landlady was very friendly and the accomodation charmingly old-fashioned and simple.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2073%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><a href=#day-3-h칛ssleholm---n칬sdala><h3 id=day-3-h칛ssleholm---n칬sdala><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Day 3: H칛ssleholm - N칬sdala</h3></a><p>The way out of H칛ssleholm led through a nice wetland area which was originally man-made, but had been colonised very well by all kinds of local birds. It was a calm, overcast and slightly frosty early Saturday morning, and we saw different ducks, geese, swans, a cormorant, oyster catchers, a kite and all kinds of other smaller birds.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2080%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>Then we walked up into the forest again, first beech then thick pine and spruce, with the occasional sad-looking clear-cut area.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2084%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>We had a tea break sitting on soft moss, far away from any road noises.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2087%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>Walking downwards into the little village of Tormastorp, we had hoped for the only food place along this day&rsquo;s trail to be open, Pizzeria Capri. But it was closed. So we walked up the hill into the forest again and ate the last of the savoury muffins we&rsquo;d brought. The long stretch along the G칬inge ridge (G칬inge친sen) was mostly beech forest again, with large boulders lying hapharzadly around.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2090%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2091%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>At around 3 we arrived at our third accomodation, Rallahustruns, a newly opened, very nicely restored small old hostel/hotel in the middle of the forest. We cooked our pre-ordered dinner box (Pasta with tomato sauce, parmesan and artichokes) and slept in the nice soft bed.</p><a href=#day-4-n칬sdala---h칬칬r><h3 id=day-4-n칬sdala---h칬칬r><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Day 4: N칬sdala - H칬칬r</h3></a><p>It was clearly spring now. We started walking in bright sunshine, clear blue sky, and the temperature noticebly increased during the day to around 12 췈C. At times we only walked in T-shirts and we stopped more frequently to drink water. This part of the trail was also more exposed, leading through small farm areas with alpine character - hard, rocky grassland and hundred-year-old scraggly oaks. At each farm we passed, a barking dog announced our presence to the next farm&rsquo;s dog.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20102%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20103%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>About 20 km into the walk, we made the decision to cut the day a bit short and take a train from Tj칬rnarp to H칬칬r instead of walking another 16 km to H칬칬r.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20104%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>This was mostly due to my head hurting a bit, Laika looking a bit exhausted in the warmth and that we wanted to enjoy our next accomodation a bit, which was by far the most expensive on the whole trip - Stift 칀kersberg. Somewhat disappointing though, the room was quite basic, with two single beds and a tiny bathroom without a tub. I washed my hair for the first time on the trip, because at least they had a hair dryer, and then we left Laika in the room and went to &ldquo;downtown&rdquo; H칬칬r to have late lunch. Given the small size of H칬칬r, we were quite impressed that we not only found a place with decent Neapolitain-style pizza (Bella Mozarella), but also a British pie shop (The Barking Dog Diner) and a super-cute caf칠 (Caf칠 Old Fashion).</p><p>Full of pizza and loaded up on sweets, we spent the rest of the day chilling in the bed, but went out again for an evening walk to visit Sk친nes geographical centre point

Mostly along wider forest paths, we passed two other hikers! The most we&rsquo;d seen on the whole trail so far.</p><p>Towards Fulltofta Naturreservat, the number of day walkers increased, some having picnics or barbecuing on a public grillplats. No wonder, it was sunny Easter Sunday! Parts of the trail through the nature reserve were on nice wooden walkways through wetlands and along little streams.

Then we walked towards H칬rby, and into the town centre. The walk was officially over, we celebrated with ice cream and waited at a completely deserted bus station for our bus back to Lund.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20121%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>Just when we thought that it had been quietly cancelled it turned around the corner, 8 minutes late. 45 minutes later, we got on an 칐resundst친g in Lund that brought us home to Helsingborg.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20123%20of%20123.jpeg width=auto alt></p><a href=#sl2-southern-half><h1 id=sl2-southern-half><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>SL2 Southern half</h1></a><a href=#planning><h2 id=planning><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Planning</h2></a><p>20-30 km chunks with good public transport connections on either side.

<strong>23 km total</strong></p><p>We walked this bit in March 2024.
It was cool and calm, no leaves on the trees yet. The part along Ringsj칬 was a bit boring, because it was just straight and flat, but then a bit up and through R칬varekulan was really nice. The wild garlic was <em>everywhere</em>. We walked past Kungsk칛llan and drank some water that apparently already some king hundreds of years ago had drunk. Saw animals walking past farms, including bisons and goats. Finally arrived in L칬ber칬d, where there was an ICA that didn&rsquo;t have any ice cream.

The first part of the walk threw us right into the midst of bursting ripe raspberry bushes; I could&rsquo;ve spend hours there! Up and down through fields (Sk친ne is surprisingly hilly there) of potatoes, wheat, barley and oat, with the occasional little forest in between.
A few times we had to walk through cow pastures, but they were mostly just chilling in some corner of the field. Only once did we crawl under the fence prematurily, because the whole cow herd had congregated around the stile that exists the pasture.
From Harl칬sa church there was a view over the flatland of Vombs칛nkan, and we some some graceful Red Kites circling above. We walked down, and then for hours along a pretty straight path that had been a railroad line before. Paused at Krankesj칬n to spot some birds, then continued onwards to H칛llestad. The last few kilometers were along the old railroad embankment, totally overgrown with wildflowers full of insects and butterflies. It was tough walking (also many nettles) but really nice to see so much different flora and fauna.
In H칛llestad we got some drinks and ice cream at a lovely little caf칠/shop.</p><p><img src=https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden//projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240719113459.png width=auto alt></p><a href=#day-3-dalby---h칛ckeberga-slott-283-km><h3 id=day-3-dalby---h칛ckeberga-slott-283-km><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Day 3 Dalby - H칛ckeberga slott (28.3 km)</h3></a><p>Train + bus
