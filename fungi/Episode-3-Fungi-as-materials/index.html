In the last ten years, materials made with or from fungi have started to pop up in design and art magazines, as chairs, lampshades or wallets or even as whole buildings. So far mostly used as concept pieces or promotional material from design studies, fungi products might finally go mainstream in 2021. The New York Times

It‚Äôs not that often that people get excited about fungi on their feet.</p><p>So let‚Äôs look into what kind of fungi materials there are, how to make them, and why they‚Äôre exciting. We‚Äôll start with leather.</p><a href=#mycelium-leather><h2 id=mycelium-leather><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Mycelium leather</h2></a><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThere are traditionally two ways to make a leather jacket. One involves a cow, and takes years. Another involves synthetic fabric, and requires plastic. But there‚Äôs a third option: thick sheets of woven fungus, grown over a couple of weeks on anything from sawdust to agricultural waste.‚Äù (
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/science/fungus-leather.html?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Remember how mycoprotein is made in big vats for food, as described in
<a href="https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds/?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>Episode 2</a>? You can make fungal leather in much the same way - where the fibrous mycelium pulp is pressed into sheets like paper pulp in traditional paper-making.</p><p>More commonly though, fungal leather is obtained by solid state fermentation, meaning that the mycelium grows in mats on a bed of nutritious solid particles, often agricultural waste, such as straw or sawdust. This is less energy-intensive than liquid cultivation, and also allows the mycelium to grow in its naturally self-assembling, three-dimensional structure, which is important for the texture and durability of the resulting material.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/R0YiVsb.jpg width=auto alt> <em>Pressed and dried mycelium mats (Credit: Bolt Threads)</em></p><p>Some species are more suitable than others [1]. The fungi used for this process are usually of the mushroom-forming variety (basidiomycetes), therefore the growth conditions have to be adjusted carefully to suppress mushroom formation and get only the desired dense mats of mycelium. Indonesia-based Mycotech - who launched

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykWIACD6u8E&utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>switching</a> to Ganoderma (also called Lingzhi or Reishi) because it gave better results. Generally,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>polypores</a> - which you can often find on the side of tree trunks - are used for creating fungi materials, because they grow in a denser structure than other fungal species.</p><p>After 5-10 days of growth, the mat of interwoven mycelium is harvested, pressed and dried to obtain a material that is already surprisingly leather-like. It doesn‚Äôt need a full-on tanning process like animal leather, though some chemical treatment is necessary to make it more resilient and improve its properties. Soaking in glycerol increases elasticity and strength [2] and immersing in acid or alcohol removes undesired soluble components and results in crosslinking, which gives the material additional strength and durability. Bleaching or treatment to eliminate odour might also be necessary. After that, the fungal material is pressed and dried, and dyed or imprinted if desired. The result is a material with a nice organic texture, velvety and soft to the touch, a bit like stroking a dry camembert.</p><p>Despite not being a completely chemical-free process, production of fungal leather has a much lower environmental impact than animal leather or conventional synthetic leather, which is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_leather?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#Environmental_impact" rel=noopener>made from</a> petroleum-based PVC. A big advantage is also that the mycelium mats can be grown to sizes of several square metres and to many desired shapes or thicknesses.</p><p>Being a biological growth process, no direct energy input is needed (if grown in solid state fermentation and at ambient temperature). And since the species of fungi used are wood degraders, the growth substrates are typically waste or by-products from forestry and agriculture, or even paper and cardboard, which makes the production process in essence an upcycling process.</p><p>Considerable energy input is however necessary not only for the steps after growth (such as pressing and drying), but also for sterilising the raw materials <em>before</em> the fungi can grow on them. This is usually done with heat and steam, but there are less energy-intensive alternatives such as submerging the raw material in peroxide solution for an hour, or in cold water for a few days.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly for a new technology, cost estimates show that mycelium leather is cheaper to produce than comparable animal or synthetic leather varieties [3], since the raw materials cost next to nothing.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e1INe92.jpeg width=auto alt> <em>Mycelium leather samples (Credit: Bolt Threads)</em></p><p>So what are the difficulties in making fungi leather? In an environment where the raw material is literally agricultural waste teeming with thousands of organisms, contamination is one of the biggest issues manufacturers are facing. Even with rigorous sterilisation and cleaning procedures, it‚Äôs tricky to avoid other microbes growing alongside the desired fungus, possibly resulting in a damaged product or no product at all.</p><p>Another issue is inconsistency. Biological processes can be finicky, and fungal growth is no exception. Changes in temperature, humidity, substrate composition, time of day, light, CO2 concentration, etc. lead to variations in growth, resulting in products with inconsistent thickness, texture, colour or structure. And customers tend to like consistency.</p><p>Fungal leather hasn‚Äôt been on the market very long yet, so longer-term durability is still unknown. And one of the biggest selling points of fungal leather is also up for discussion: its biodegradability. While pure mycelium can be completely biologically degraded within weeks, polymer composites or coated mycelium materials might not be (and take as long to decompose as the least-biodegradable component in the mix). If fungal leather is mixed too much with other materials, we might end up with the same problem that coated paper and bioplastics face, which is that they are hard or impossible to recycle properly once they reach the end of their life or use.</p><p>Mycowork‚Äôs Reishi (which was presented at
<a href="https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/reishi-launch-at-new-york-fashion-week?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>NY fashion week</a> in February 2020), for example, incorporates polyester as reinforcement and has a polylactic acid coating, which gives it
<a href="https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/performance-results-q120?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>higher tear strength and higher flexibility</a> than even animal leather, but also makes the material hardly biodegradable.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIn theory, we can grow Reishi in any shape, whether that‚Äôs something very large and seamless, or smaller custom shapes that eliminate all the waste associated with cutting a hide. With leather, you‚Äôre essentially cutting arbitrary patterns into a cow-shaped hide and so a lot of our brand partners are excited by the fact that Reishi can be grown in any shape‚Äìboth for the design possibilities that creates and the reduction of waste.‚Äù (Matt Scullin, Mycoworks CEO,

The other prominent player in the field is Ecovative, a mycelium materials pioneer that was founded in New York in 2007.

Fill some sawdust into a container, add the right kind of fungi spores, wait a few days, and you get a compact block of a natural mycelium composite that is dense, light and surprisingly strong. The mycelium acts like a glue binding the particles together (while also partially digesting them). After baking and killing the living fungi, the material is dry and durable.</p><p><img src=https://indiebio.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mushroom_brick_mycoworks.jpg width=auto alt> <em>Mycelium bricks stacked on top of each other (Credit: Mycoworks)</em></p><p>If ‚Äúblocks of light, dense material‚Äù remind you of polystyrene, you‚Äôre not alone.

It‚Äôs hard to imagine mycelium foam to be more than a gimmick for high-priced products, since there is already a cheap, widely used, environmentally-friendly solution widely available: paper and cardboard.</p><p>On the other hand, however, fungi-based packaging can be directly made at the farms that produce the primary raw materials, and could offer a more local and low-emission packaging solution that doesn‚Äôt require cutting down trees [4]. If that‚Äôs enough to compete with existing materials, or if fungi packaging will remain an ultra-niche product, remains to be seen.</p><p>Nevertheless, fungi‚Äôs unique ability to fill and grow into any shape can be used to make more than just throw-away packaging.

Conveniently, mycelium composites have been found to absorb noise very well, especially the range of car noise (1,000 Hz) and are more fire-resistant and release less smoke than plastic alternatives [5].</p><p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iv54NkeBYrrpMy4eB6aCor8JAGw=/0x0:5616x3744/1820x1213/filters:focal%282359x1423:3257x2321%29:format%28webp%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55655605/GrowLamp_HangingPendants5.0.jpg" width=auto alt> <em>Lampshades made out of mycelium (Credit: Ecovative)</em></p><p>Fungi can even be used to construct buildings.

Mycelium blocks can be used as cheap and fire-resistant construction and insulation material. Not only are
<a href="https://criticalconcrete.com/building-with-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>these materials</a> biodegradable, but they can also trap more heat than fiberglass insulation, are fireproof, nontoxic, and stronger than concrete relative to its weight [6].</p><p>There are some downsides, of course. Low water resistance can be a problem in construction use, making the material vulnerable to humidity and - ironically - mould. Mycelium material in stable conditions has a lifespan of decades, but when in contact with wet ground it can
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q5i9poYc3w&utm_source=Filaments&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials" rel=noopener>start decomposing</a> in a matter of weeks. In that sense, mycelium behaves like untreated softwood. Like wood, the mycelium bricks can be treated with coatings that make them more resilient but might compromise the 100% biodegradability factor. It‚Äôs a thorny problem to solve.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe future of materials is going to be grown ‚Äì biofabricated ‚Äì and mycelium and its extraordinary ability to assemble itself into complex structures is what will enable us to take biofabrication to the next level of performance.‚Äù (Eben Bayer, Ecovative CEO,

The input influences the outcome; fungi cultivated on one substrate (such as wheat straw) look and feel different than fungi grown on another substrate (such as sawdust). Even sawdust from different kinds of trees can give varying results.</p><p>Different fungal species can also have vastly different characteristics when it comes to mechanical properties, looks and material behaviour [9]. Getting consistent products at large-scale will be the biggest challenge for mycelium material producers.</p><p>The technology to manufacture fungal materials, especially at a large scale, is still in development. Ecovative first grew mycelium in open trays, but later invented a system where growth takes place in a solid-state bioreactor which supplies air at the right humidity and temperature to the fungi. Currently though, mycelium cultivation is still done mostly manually, without much automation [6]. And, ironically, a lot of plastic is used to make the fungal material, since mycelium bricks are often grown in single-use plastic bags and moulds.</p><p>Finding the right customers is another challenge. A lot of the applications of fungal material are in low-price segments, such as packaging or insulation. That‚Äôs why at least initially most companies in the area target art galleries, design studios or organisations that want a few expensive statement pieces. To make fungi-based materials affordable for the mass market, economies of scale are needed.</p><p>Having said that, we will certainly also see more fungi furniture, design products and clothes in the future, made by small studios and artisans. The manufacturing process of, for example, mycelium leather is much more accessible than traditional leather making. Growing products our of fungi could become a new craft where artists, small businesses but also commercial mushroom cultivators experiment and develop new ways of using mycelium.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Antoni Gandia, R&D Specialist at MOGU and former Research Scientist at Ecovative, for interesting conversations that helped me dig into this rapidly-expanding field.</em></p><hr><p>[1] Fungi as source for bio-based materials: A patent review.
