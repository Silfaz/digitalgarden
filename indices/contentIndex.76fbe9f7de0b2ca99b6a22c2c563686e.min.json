We completely missed to inform the styrelse when we agreed with our tenants to extend their rental agreement. They are good friends of ours that we trust, and they have been going through some hard times with finishing up a PhD and suffering a miscarriage. \n\nHowever, we of course understand that we made a mistake not communicating with the BRF to extend or renew the agreement about renting out our apartment. \n\nWe have now notified our tenants that they will have to move out. We will also begin the process of selling the apartment.\n\nIf you have any further questions please get in touch. Otherwise we'll contact you when necessary about the sale. \n\nBest regards,\nSilvia\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://mitt.riksbyggen.se/boende/mina-kontrakt/\n\nhttps://www.riksbyggen.se/bostad/kopa-bostadsratt/lagar-och-regler/andrahandsuthyrning/\n\nWhere's the contract? It's not in my mina sidor.\n\nhttps://bobattre.se/BostadsrattSalja.asp?Page=P02\n\nN√§r du tr√§ffat √∂verenskommelse med k√∂paren av din bostadsr√§tt m√•ste ni skriva ett √∂verl√•telseavtal. Detta avtal √§r bindande.\n\nDu  m√•ste meddela styrelsen att du t√§nker s√§lja din bostadsr√§tt.\nK√∂paren m√•ste ans√∂ka om medlemskap i f√∂reningen omedelbart efter f√∂rv√§rvet.\n\nDet kan vara l√§mpligt att skaffa ett f√∂rhandsbesked fr√•n styrelsen innan f√∂rv√§rvet sker. Styrelsen brukar ta en kreditupplysning p√• den nye medlemmen och eventuellt kontrollera k√∂parens referenser fr√•n tidigare boende m m.\n\nStyrelsen kan neka k√∂paren medlemskap i f√∂reningen. Skulle detta ske √§r √∂verl√•telsen ogiltig och s√§ljaren har kvar sin bostadsr√§tt. K√∂paren kan √∂verklaga styrelsens beslut till hyresn√§mnden.\n\nOm k√∂paren beviljas medlemskap g√•r ni vidare och kommer √∂verens om datum f√∂r skifte av bostadsr√§tten. Du som s√§ljare beh√∂ver inte ha ett formellt besked om att du inte l√§ngre √§r medlem i f√∂reningen. Du anses automatiskt ha l√§mnat f√∂reningen s√• snart du inte har kvar n√•gon bostadsr√§tt.\n\nOnce you have reached an agreement with the buyer of your condominium, you must sign a transfer agreement. This agreement is binding.\n\nYou must notify the board that you intend to sell your apartment.\n\nThe buyer must apply for membership of the association immediately after the purchase.\n\nIt may be advisable to obtain a preliminary decision from the board before the purchase takes place. The board usually carries out a credit check on the new member and may check the buyer's references from previous accommodation, etc.\n\nThe board can deny the buyer membership of the association. If this happens, the transfer is invalid and the seller retains his or her condominium. The buyer can appeal the board's decision to the Rent Board.\n\nIf the buyer is granted membership, you proceed and agree on a date for the transfer of the condominium. As a seller, you do not need a formal notification that you are no longer a member of the association. You are automatically considered to have left the association as soon as you no longer have a condominium.\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.165431558Z","tags":null},"/Bertie-shift-dress-Liberty":{"title":"Bertie shift dress (Liberty)","content":"_Not made yet (as of April 2024)._\n\n## Pattern\nLiberty Fabrics\n\n## Fabric\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.165431558Z","tags":null},"/Canicross":{"title":"","content":"[Facebook group Canicross 2023 Onlinekurs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/590997822424489)\n\n\n## Lektion 1 - Utrustning\n_2023-03-20_\n[Lektion 1](https://propiraya.wordpress.com/2020/05/16/canicross-online-lektion-1-1-utrustning/) PW: CO11\n\n### Sele till hunden\n- Det viktigaste √§r att **draget ligger p√• br√∂stbenet** fram p√• hundens hals och INTE ligger an p√• sj√§lva halsen n√§r hunden ligger i dragl√§get.

Set the start/goal area. Place some treats for your dog and some water for your dog and yourself.\n2. Warm-up round: Walk the round to let the dog pee and poop. (During canicross, they shouldn't stop and pee.) Ideally, use a different harness/collar and leash for this walk. \n3. When you come back to the goal: Lyxstund. Give the dog some treats, play a bit, make it a nice and positive place to be.\n4. First round: Walk the round again without pulling until about 1/4 is left, then start (slowly!) jogging and let the dog pull if she wants to. If the dog pulls, use a reward word (**\"BRA!\"**) that doesn't make her look up to you. Getting closer to the goal area, the dog will probably start pulling a bit more. \n5. In the goal: Lyxstund. \n6. Repeat 1-2 times by first walking, then starting to jog when 1/4 of the round is left. Ideally, the dog will get the concept and start pulling earlier and earlier. If your dog understands it, you can start jogging already at half the round. Some dogs need several repetitions on the same round, other get it immediately and you can proceed to a different round to create a generalisation. \n7. Repeat this every few days. If the dog starts pulling earlier than at half the round, start jogging earlier. Build up endurance together with your dog!\n\nRound 1: Visk√§ngen. Start/goal near outdoor gym. Run on the inside of the round to avoid crossing other walkers and cyclists. \n![](private/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230326165859.png)\n\n- _2023-03-26, First try:_ Worked really well. We did 3 rounds, first walking, the next two jogging from checkpoint 3. Laika was very good and really pulled from checkpoint 3 to the goal, where she got a lot of treats. \n-","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.165431558Z","tags":null},"/Comms-group-meetings-quick-notes":{"title":"","content":"\n\n## 2023-06-25 - Suggestions for summer field trips\n\n### Concept\n- Meet at station/bus stop\n- Go together to a place\n- Walk together around (2ish hours), possibility of picnic, fika\n- Go back together\n- Have a good time, chat, take photos, experience nature, use public transport\n\n### Destination suggestions\n1. **R√•√•ns dalg√•ng** Bus nr. 1 fr√•n Hbg till R√•√• (15 min), vandra l√§ngs med R√•√•n to Gantofta (7 km, so approx. 1.5 h), mycket vacker, fika i \"Dalstugan\" (https://www.facebook.com/people/Dalstugan/100063733681548/) i Gantofta, P√•gat√•get fr√•n Gantofta till Hbg. https://helsingborg.se/uppleva-och-gora/friluftsliv-och-motion/naturomrade/raans-dalgang/.

Southern side of the river is a bit trickier to walk, northern side is suitable for prams and rullstol. Trains back from Gantofta every hour at :17 (takes 11 min).

On its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But together, many trees create an ecosystem that moderates extremes of heat and cold, stores a great deal of water, and generates a great deal of humidity. And in this protected environment, trees can live to be very old. To get to this point, the community must remain intact no matter what. If every tree were looking out only for itself, then quite a few of them would never reach old age. Regular fatalities would result in many large gaps in the tree canopy, which would make it easier for storms to get inside the forest and uproot more trees. The heat of summer would reach the forest floor and dry it out. Every tree would suffer. Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping around for as long as possible.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.373433038Z","tags":null},"/Tilda-blouse-Maison-Fauve":{"title":"Tilda blouse (Maison Fauve)","content":"## Pattern\nMaison Fauve, size 38.\n\n\n## Fabric\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.373433038Z","tags":null},"/Train-journey-through-Europe":{"title":"Train journey through Europe","content":"## Sweden-Denmark-Germany-Netherlands-Belgium-Luxemburg-Austria-Germany-Sweden\nIn June 2023 we went on a three-week trip (with our dog) from Sweden, via Germany to Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, Austria, and back through Germany.

It was a surprisingly interesting book that weaves (üòè) history and culture and inventions and chemistry together. I had no idea that there was a lot of silk making in Europe, that during the 1300s and 1400s many European cities had very strict clothing laws that determined what fabric or colour people could wear (and how the people then circumvented those laws), and that fabric dying was the foundation of chemistry and many pharma companies of today. \n- Went to **Karlshamn** for a project meeting. Sleepy town, but nicely located by the sea with a an extensive archipelago and hiking routes, and a smooth 2h trainride from Malm√∂. Will definitely go there again and explore a bit more. \n- My parents picked 16 (!) ticks off their dog after a stroll through the forest. YUCK! It's truly summer now.\n- My company is a sponsor of the **Malm√∂ football club Malm√∂ FF** and raffles away tickets to the box among employees. On Tuesday it was my turn. Being in the box was a cool experience, felt very VIP and fancy. We got (plant-based) dinner, drinks and soft-serve ice cream and had a great view of the pitch. But the game itself... mh, let's just say it didn't convert me to becoming a football fan. After watching, and really enjoying, **Welcome to Wrexham**, I thought that I might want to be a football fan, but sitting through 2h of a game that consists mostly of passing the ball back and forth brought me back to reality.\n- Had a cosy little crochet evening with my friend Tessa. She showed me the gigantic knitting and crocheting resource https://www.ravelry.com/. Drops also has loads of free patterns, and I wanted to make [this top](https://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=9133\u0026cid=19). But I didn't get very far this time, my needle was too small. \n- Fascinating article from The New Yorker about solar storms: [What a Major Solar Storm Could do to Our Planet](https://web.archive.org/web/20240528201920/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/04/what-a-major-solar-storm-could-do-to-our-planet).\n- Prejudices about capabilities shape what we are actually capable of. \"Stupid\" and \"clever\" rats both have the same ability to run through a maze, but our perception of one makes us treat them differently and influence the outcome. Blind people can echolocate and navigate their world amazingly well if they are not overly coddled. [How to Become Batman](https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/378577902/how-to-become-batman) from the NPR podcast series **Invisibilia**.\n- After a bit of a break from my guitar practice, I've picked it up again. Currently working on playing the chords to Losing my Religion and the melody of O sole mio. üé∂\n- Wou Creative organised the **Communitive Festival** on Saturday at STPLN, and I helped as a volunteer. It was fun and I chatted to a lot of super nice people. Finding nice communities in Malm√∂ is one of my main goals currently, and there is a lot going on. Alanna and S√°ri did a great job putting together a little guide to 35 clubs and communities in Malm√∂ - mediation circle, choir, urban art, analog photography, dancing, repair cafe, etc. I might join a **communal forest garden** group.\n\n\n## w21 2024\n- The **weather** has been loooovely for 2 weeks now - 22C and sunny. Quite breezy/windy though, because it's Malm√∂, but that's ok. Though North India is getting up to 50C this weekend, parts of Mexico hotter than ever at 40-50C ‚òπÔ∏è\n- We played our new boardgame **Earth**. The goal is to fill your ecosystem with plants, grow them, compost them, and fulfil some objectives. It's nice. I especially like all the cards with different trees, flowers and mushrooms, and the range of ecosystems and terrains that you can pick. It's not very collaborative, and only in the very end competitive. You play more along each other than really _with_ each other, but it's still a nice activity.\n- I started the well-known and -loved **Yoga with Adriene** on Youtube. Let's see if I keep up the whole 30 day program. My plan is not to do 30 consecutive days, but rather do yoga at least on the days when I work from home. \n- We finally sold the **Gothenburg apartment**! Relieved, but a bit sad. Also because we got less than what we paid for in 2017; the market was hot at that time, the interest rate low, and we bid with 6 other people to quite a high price. So we knew we couldn't expect _too_ much now, but for that we got a decent price. Eight people at the viewing, two eventually bid, starting 100 k lower than the starting price, but reaching almost the starting price again. \n- The **Southern Sweden Design Days** were happening this week. We went to Lokstallarna, a cool former train yard with spacious old brick buildings and industrial flair. There were some cool things, especially the student's projects were very interesting. Some stuff was a bit annoying though - either too arrogant-artsy, or too greenwashing. I did love a model of the Turning Torso made from tempeh, as well as rugs that look like petri dishes or aerial photography.\n\n![|400](Pasted%20image%2020240601171333.png)\n\n![|400](Pasted%20image%2020240601171407.png)\n- **Malm√∂ Garden show** also took place on the weekend, and Slottsparken was full of stands selling plants, garden stuff or locally made chili sauce, kimchi, or kombucha. We had Jamaican food from a food truck, and I bought a little black raspberry bush that will likely only get fruits next year. \n- **Lime Garden** played a free concert at Plan B. Short setlist, but quite good. I love [I want to be you](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=jFYemNmWI4M\u0026si=mf5XScj6vcO4dDmk).\n- Malm√∂ Garden show\n- Interesting podcast episode with the director of the World Food Program: [Wir k√∂nnten den Hunger bis 2030 besiegen](https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000216337/world-food-programme-martin-frick-koennten-hunger-bist-2030-besiegen). \n- \"Climate (change) is by now one of the most certain things. Whether or not there'll still be a war in Ukraine this time next year no one can tell, but that it's getting warmer is for sure.\"\n- [Heat Death of the Internet](https://www.takahe.org.nz/heat-death-of-the-internet/). Yay for Wikipedia and local libraries. \n\n\n## w20 2024\n- Went to the **dentist** for yearly check-up. She just said that I have very clean teeth and that I should keep doing what I'm doing. \n- **Workshop about community circles** at STPLN, organised by wou creative. It was a small group of people talking about different aspects of communities, and it was the first time I participated in a discussion round with a \"talking stone\" that goes around and only the person holding it is allowed to talk. It took me some time to get used to that, or mentally let go of the \"normal\" style of discussion and conversation. But once I had landed in that, it was very calming. It removes the need to have to respond to what is being said, instead of listening and reflecting quietly. And it allows you to collect your thoughts without feeling pressed for time or being talked over by someone faster or louder. So it was a really interesting and nice experience.\n- Loud Numbers had a **vernissage** at Kulturhotellet Helsingborg on Friday evening. Their work was a  sonification and visualisation of Sk√•ne's forest fires in 2018, a particularly dry and hot summer. The whole exhibition was really nice, called Nature's Harmony. It featured Paul Khedra making music with plants, a tulip-shaped rug mural, a moss-covered heap, a life-sized sculpture of a kneeling person, a big photo of a Swedish forest, wax cloth drapings in the shape of beehives, and decorative pieces by Gothenburg's own sprayer artist Ollio. \n- For the first time in more than 10 years, I am without a **Spotify** premium account. We decided to jump ship after the most recent 20% price increase and declining quality of playlists, worse payment for artists and lots of ads (in podcasts) despite paid subscription. Since we pay for Youtube (to not be tormented by ads), we thought we'd give Youtube Music a go. So far it's been fine. There's a lot of stuff on it, including things that Spotify doesn't have. Bit tricky is to find the right version of songs, e.g. the \"official\" version instead of a video uploaded by some random person. Then of course Youtube Music also doesn't really know my recent music taste very well, so it needs more curating and finding things myself, but that's part of the fun. It got a bit boring with Spotify suggesting the same things over and over again. So we'll see how it goes. For podcasts I downloaded the free app Podbean, which does the job. \n- It was **Mat \u0026 Dryckfestivalen at Folkets Park** this weekend. We went for an early lunch, had West African food and enjoyed the sun. The weather right now is **PERFECT** - 22c and sunshine. \n- **Plant update**: I finally got all the soil I need (actually, I could use a bit more, but let's leave it for now). I placed all plants on the balcony and the tomatoes and peppers are thriving. Sunflowers are also coming up, and I've finally seeded corn flowers, poppies, nasturtiums and marigolds. \n![](plants.jpg)\n## w19 2024\n- **Eurovision**. OMG. It's right now (Saturday afternoon, hours before the finale) a clusterfuck burning brightly and it's still to be seen how much worse it will get. First there were \"just\" the expected constant pro-Palestinian protests and \"genocide!\" posters, criticising Israel's participation in the contest while slaughtering thousands of people. That all came with the biggest police presence anyone had ever seen in Malm√∂ (a journalist mentioned he had only seen anything like it maybe during the G8 summit) - heavy rifles, hovering helicopters, snipers on roofs, constant patrolling, drones. One act in the first semifinals wore a Palestinian scarf. SVT started muting the booing in the arena when Israel performed. For some reason the Italian RAI leaked the numbers of the voting for the second semifinal, and it showed a landslide win for Israel with 40% of all votes (apparently Ukraine in 2022 right after Russia's invasion had \"only\" 25%), which in turn suddently caused Israel to shoot up in the chances for winning the contest. On Friday the Dutch contestant was excluded from the finals because of some undisclosed mysterious \"incident\" with a staff member. Irelands contestant accused the Israeli broadcasting agency of inappropriate comments and called for their disqualification as well. The European Broadcasting Union EBU is still very sparse on any comments about anything, keeping to their stance that \"Eurovision is non-political\", LOL. The French contestant stopped halfway through the rehearsal, just leaving the stage. Etc. etc. I love the colourful, crazy, tacky, tongue-in-cheek and uniting Eurovision, and I'm very worried that this will be the end of it. \n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020240511171204.png)\n\n- I got a lovely book from Duncan's parents called \"**Tr√§d i Malm√∂**\", detailing all the different trees that grow here. I've much more consciously looked at trees when dog-walking (and right now is also the best time to see differences, with most of them bursting with flowers). \n- Fell into a rabbit hole about **[Schneitelung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneitelung?useskin=vector)/[Pollarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollarding?useskin=vector)/[Hamling](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamling?useskin=vector)**, since we have some many [Kopfweiden](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopfweide?useskin=vector)/[Pilevall](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilevall?useskin=vector) in the nearby park. The drastic cutting of treetops creates a thick and often hollow trunk that becomes its whole ecosystem for loads of insects and other animals, and has many benefits for surrounding wildlife and even soil and landscape. There's a nice Arte documentary I found on Youtube: [Lebensraum Kopfbaum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9az9fTMDvSo\u0026t=44). \n- [Interesting Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/1cj3ds6/relationship_with_an_austrian_apologising/) about the differences between Austrians and Brits when it comes to **apologising**. I have to say that I can see myself in some of these comments, and it explains some discussions (miscommunications?) I've had with Duncan. \n- Malm√∂ city has so far impressed me a lot with their shared public space policies. It feels that much more in other cities I've lived so far, drivers, cyclist, pedestrians and public transport feel like equal participants rather than being mostly car-focussed. The bike infrastructure is great, and while there are big roads for cars, they have very frequent zebra crossings and cars stop for pedestrians. And because the big roads are just a few arteries, within city blocks it generally feels calm. Additionally, during the summer months (generous - from April to October) several streets are blocked off for through-traffic, called \"**sommargata**\" (summer street) and all along those streets seatings and plants pop up for people to enjoy. It's sooo nice! This year, they've even turned a usually bleak carpark right in the middle of a nice neighbourhood with lots of small restaurants and bars into a \"**sommartorg**\" (summer square), creating a lovely space for people to hang out, children to play, and the surrounding restaurants to expand their outside seating. üòç\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020240511165309.png)\n## w18 2024\n- Visited the **Kejsaretr√§d** at Lilla Torget which is right now in full bloom, with light purple trumpets. \n- Met Beatrice, a potential **dogtrainer** for Laika. She was generally very impressed with Laika, calming us that her occasional snappiness with other dogs that she meets on the street is normal and that we don't need to feel like we need to meet every dog we see. We'll probably arrange a doggy date with her and her dogs to see how compatible they are. It would be nice to have a solid option for dog boarding in case we want to go somewhere without Laika. \n- Went to the 1st of May demonstrations organised by the left party (V√§nsterpartiet) with Anna. \n- **Mitt M√∂llan** organised a spring market and we got some nice earrings, a lino print, a poster, vegan pralines and a pretty mug. I don't buy many things these days, but it's always nice to support small local artists. \n- **Grandaddy** (i.e. Jason Lytle) had a little live living room concert for their fan club (which I am part of). It was lovely üíï\n- We went on a guided excursion through **Limhamns kalkbrott**, organised by [Vilda Malm√∂](https://malmo.se/Uppleva-och-gora/Natur-och-parker/Vilda-Malmo.html). Usually it's not allowed to go into the area of the former quarry. It was really impressive - it's this massive hole in the middle of Malm√∂'s outskirts that has developed into its own ecosystem. \n![](DSCF9502.jpg)\n- [This Nature podcast episode](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01158-6) was both educational and entertaining: **_Living on Mars would suck - here's why._** It lays out the realistic scenarios of colonising Mars and Moon. Including incredibly sharp moon dust that clings to everything, ionising radiation that would probably require us to live underground rather than in fancy glass domes with a view, and the fact that a stable outer Earth colony would be a large scale, multi-generational genetic experiment. I'm still a huge sci-fi fan, but over the last decade or so I've completely lost my excitement for colonising other planets, since we're doing such a good job destroying our own. If we can't take care of literally the only known place in the universe that doesn't kill us immediately, what's the use in venturing out and trying to \"re-green\" Mars?\n- I finished sewing two more **[Donny shirts](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt.md)**, one for my mum and one for my sister. I still struggle with the pattern a bit at different stages, but it also massively depends on the \n## w17 2024\n- **Plant update**! The tomatoes are thriving, the peppers are doing well, the smultron I grew from seeds are still tiny, so is the lemon basil. Nasturtiums germinated a bit erratic, some didn't do anything and others suddenly shot up. Of the smultron I got as plants from my parents a few survived and look good, and a few dried out. \n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020240425073939.png)\n\n- Duncan's parents were here for a week, and we did a lot of nice **touristy Malm√∂ things**. Malm√∂ is not such a \"flashy\" city as Stockholm, Copenhagen, or even Gothenburg. It's a bit harder to find places that make tourists go \"oh, let's take a picture\". Partly because it's so flat, it rarely offers a view. Partly because it doesn't really have many important buildings. There's Malm√∂hus slott, which stretches the definition of a castle quite a lot. But inside it's very interesting, explaining mostly about the times when Denmark and Sweden fought about the Southern part of (what is now) Sweden. There's the technical museum (which has a U-boat!), the art galleries Konsthall and Moderna Museet, the nice long beach to walk along, the inner city with old buildings and pedestrianised shopping streets, the indie mall Mitt M√∂llan around where we live, nice parks, amazing restaurants and bakeries, etc. They didn't run out of things to do. And when they did, they went to Lund. \n- I went to **Gothenburg** for 24h to paint some walls in our old apartment before selling. Not sure if it will make any difference tough. But also took the chance to catch up with some old friends and their kids.\n\n## w16 2024\n- End of April, and it's still not really above 10C here. I don't mind, I love being able to wear my puffy, light purple jacket. Though right now Duncan's parents are visiting and it would be nice to be able to be outside for a bit without having to briskly walk to stay warm. \n- **Yard Act** concert in CPH was amazing, such a good band! (\"We make hits!!!\") I was slightly terrified of the venue though, Loppen, an old seemingly completely wooden building in Christiania with quite a low ceiling. The old stock exchange in Copenhagen burnt down just a week ago, so I got a bit paranoid, and during the concert I only felt comfortable near the emergency exits.- \n- Another concert the same weekend was Duncan's performance of **The Carrington Event**, a data sonification/post-rocky piece about the biggest recorded solar storm in history. 15 min of guitar distorted and modified through modular synth, it was a really great performance.\n\n![|500](photo_2024-04-21%2010.06.54.jpeg)\n\n- And yet another concert, the same day as Duncan's performance, was our friend's band **Baula**'s album release gig at Grand in Malm√∂. I love Baula's music, especially mercury in retrograde is my current favourite. \n- For some reason I can tolerate things in other languages that I couldn't in my mother tongue. Trash TV is one of them. I really enjoyed watching Love is blind Sweden. Now Aurora and I discovered that we both want to practice our Swedish and enjoy watching Trash TV, so we met up virtually to start watching the newest season of **Gift vid f√∂rsta √∂gonkastet** together. It was really fun! \n- Speaking of reality TV: a new season of **Race across the world** just started, and at least that's something that Duncan can also tolerate. They are travelling from Hokkaido to Indonesia. Thank god for public transport, I really didn't want a repetition of last year's stressful constant hitchhiking through Canada. \n- Useful video about [How to style a midi skirt video](https://youtu.be/4hnd_MboUqQ?si=nFQIvLeDaXHGiNif). \n- All my **plants** are growing nicely, so far still all inside. I got some forest strawberry plants from my parent's garden that should give fruit basically from spring to autumn. I potted the morning after I returned from Austria, and a few looked immediately quite good, but others seemed dead. But now even the dead-looking ones have new growth in the middle, so maybe all of them survived! üôå\n- I joined **Grandaddy's GooDs fanclub** for 100 USD a year. I love this band so much, so happy to support them in this way. Maybe they'll have another living room concert stream soon, they had one a few years ago during Covid and it was sooo nice. \n\n\n## w15 2024\n- Went to **Austria** for a long weekend for Onkel Christian's 70th birthday celebrations. I did the travel down all in one day by train, leaving Malm√∂ at 6:30 in the morning. I was supposed to arrive in Wels at 20:30, but my connection in N√ºrnberg was an hour delayed and that caused later connections to not work, etc. In the end my parents picked me up from Attnang-Puchheim and we arrived home just before 12. Long day, but I got a ton of work done on the train, because at least I always had a good seat and an electricity connection. \n- Austria had a strange spring **heat wave** over Easter and the week after, and it was up to 26C when I was there. On the weekend we sat outside in short sleeves, then on Monday it rained and cooled down massively again. Two days later, the weather forecast predicted rain. \n- The difference in **flora** was quite stark when travelling out of Sweden through Germany and Austria. While in the South of Sweden (let's not talk about the North, they still have snow) the buds on trees juuust now start to open, Germany and Austria are already green and lush. \n- **Fauna** was also interesting in Austria. It seemed like every single Gasthaus we went to had some sort of animals nearby. One had tiny horses, another alpacas and goats. We even did an alpaca walk one day, which was fun. Very gentle and stubborn creatures. Obviously, there were also more insects than at this time in Sweden, cats running around near by parent's house, and various dogs in various places. \n\n![|500](Pasted%20image%2020240421095137.png)\n## w14 2024\n- Just came home from a swift 24h in Gothenburg. We had to go there to pick up a few last pieces from the apartment and meet the real estate agent. On the way to GBG the train was _completely_ overcrowded and no seat reservations were possible, so we were standing for 3.5h. I listened to 3 episodes of the great **Empire** podcase. Currently I'm on the Ottoman Empire. On the way back to Malm√∂ I watched a lot of sewing Youtube videos. I really like [Sew Anastasia](https://youtu.be/Giq-uaxMKiM?si=qN4fjmMTTc3zBQ2T)'s channel, e.g. how to **make a cute blouse** out of a large button-down shirt. Also, [this](https://youtu.be/7D-gxaie6UI?si=dfhDuAt-bV6ikjxm) in-depth lecture about **Tuberculosis** is very interesting. And this video about **NY's billionaires' row** of skyscrapes by The B1M not only goes into the structural details of ultra-thin buildings, but also into the socioeconomic details of inflated real estate prices and tax loopholes of the super-rich. And finally, embarrassingly, I only recently learned that the **spine** is actually completely fused to the pelvic bones! Here's a little [video](https://youtu.be/yK-8ZwLFarc?si=8uO-IQRZdYKap9ls) showing how. \n- Easter Monday was chilly and overcast, but I still wanted to go for a longer walk (but maybe not quite a hike). We ended up walking from M√∂llev√•ngstorget to [Bulltofta rekreationsomr√•de](https://malmo.se/Uppleva-och-gora/Natur-och-parker/Bulltofta-rekreationsomrade.html) and back (15 km in total). No leaves on the trees yet, so everything was still a bit barren, but it will be lovely in a few weeks.\n- I finished reading **De som inte syns** by Micha Foss-Ghazarian. I bought it back when we lived in Gothenburg, because it is a crime novel set in Gothenburg. It's the author's first book, and it would need some more editing to make the story more gripping, but for practising my Swedish it was pretty good. \n- Went to Naturkompaniet and spent about half an hour flipping through Hiking in Sweden guide books. [**Blekingeleden**](trips/Blekingeleden.md) looks really nice, it's been on my radar for a while. Also, a friend wants to hike St. Olof's leden, but 30 days is a bit of a major commitment. \n- We celebrated our 11 year anniversary by eating at **Manto**, a plant-based Afghan-ish restaurant in Malm√∂. It was _pouring_ outside, but inside it was super cosy and the food was delicious, especially the dessert: Rose-saffron-coconut ice cream with cardamom soan papdi. OMG so good.\n\n![|500](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240408194947.png)\n\n## w13 2024\n- Easter holidays! I took the whole week off. Did loads of stuff. Too much? Perhaps.\n- Lots of sewing, mostly finishing some pieces on my \"to fix\" pile. I repaired _three_ of Duncan's trousers that had ripped pockets and/or ripped knees. The knees I embroidered with **visible mending**. I also made a wearable toile of the [**Helmi trench blouse and tunic dress**](projects/sewing/Helmi%20trench%20blouse%20and%20tunic%20dress.md) from an old bedsheet that was starting to disintegrate on one end. It has a hidden button placket! That's a first.\n- I also **dyed** my corduroy [Stacker Jacket](projects/sewing/Stacker%20Jacket.md) a darker shade of blue. Originally it was very light blue, then it got some stains that didn't come out, so I dyed it light turquoise about a year ago, but it got blotchy and the colour didn't really fit me. Now it's more of a denim blue and I've already worn it more in the past week then in the previous year. So that's a win.\n- We walked part of [**Sk√•neleden**](trips/Sk√•neleden.md) North to South, continuing where we left off last Easter in H√∂rby. We only did one leg (Duncan had to work during the rest of the week), so we only managed to get to L√∂ber√∂d (23 km) before taking the bus back home. But it was super nice, especially the part along the old train line on the shore of Finsj√∂n, and R√∂varekulan. So much wild garlic!\n\n![|500](2024-04-08%2019.59.07.jpg)\n\n![|500](2024-04-08%2019.58.45.jpg)\n\n- I watched Netflix's new series **3 Body Problem**. Some years ago I tried to read Liu Cixin's novel, but couldn't focus and stopped again after a few dozen pages. The Netflix series has a slightly different setting, but I did really enjoy it. Bit anticlimactic ending though (for now). Maybe I'll watch the 30-episode Chinese Tencent version, because I am a bit annoyed at waiting 1-2 years for the sequel. \n- I also watched **Trainwreck Woodstock '99**. Similar to the Fyre festival documentary, it's a rolls in excruciating detail to the culmination of the disaster. It's very entertaining, shocking, at parts horrifying, and of course there's a whole lot of guilty Schadenfreude. \n- In preparation of the balcony extravaganza (see [Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md)) I cut down the Christmas tree that was parked there. Chopped off the branches, but kept them for now (for overwintering plants??). \n- Ate spinach on Gr√ºndonnerstag, as you do. Talked to three different real estate agents who all were different degrees of slimey. Picked the least slimey. Ate Juicy Marbles surprisingly realistic \"meat\" chunks (but what do I know, it's been over a decade since I last ate meat). Was good, but overpriced (150 SEK for two small pieces). \n- I finished reading **Der beste Platz zum Leben** (by Anne Weiss), a book I had gifted my mum for Christmas, and she gave it back to me to read myself. The author tests different ways and places to live - countryside, eco-commune, yurts, Berlin flat, etc. - and also writes a lot about the current housing situation in (mostly) Germany. It was interesting, but went far too much into detail about the German housing market, and was too little in my opinion about the real living experiments. Her conclusion was that it's important to start early on thinking about what and how you want to live when you're older. And that it's crucial to identify what is really important for yourself (e.g. not having to be dependent on a car). \n- Change to summer time. Ugh. Everyone hates it, everyone agrees that it should be abolished, but still we can't decide what the \"forever time\" should be. Given that not even this simple problem can be solved, I'm somewhat pessimistic about the infinitely more complex questions like climate change and biodiversity collapse.  \n\n## w12 2024\n- I started planting some **seedlings** indoors (cherry tomato, snack pepper, peppermint, tagetes, wild strawberries) for my big balcony [Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md) a few weeks ago. So far only the tomatoes and the peppers have germinated. \n- Today is Palm Sunday and I took the whole of next week off work! At least a few of these days we want to walk the second half of [**Sk√•neleden**](trips/Sk√•neleden.md) North-South. We walked the first half last year at Easter. Then we did 5 days in a row with overnight stays, but this time we want to do it spread out over some single day hikes, because we live much closer to the trail. \n- Last week, I finished the second **woodworking course** module at ReFab Lab, where I learned all about joining two pieces of wood together: box joings, mitre joints, half laps, full laps, etc. We got to use the router, which is super fun. When using the machinery with rotating, sharp parts I have all these intrusive thoughts about touching the blade, etc. But it gets better the more I use the equipment. \n- I also went to a **pottery afternoon** to Artibus, part of Duncan's Christmas present. I made six different things in two hours. Should be able to pick them up any day now. \n![|500](projects/attachments/IMG_20240225_115635.jpg)\n- Last season of **The Expanse**. I still love it, though the constant fighting between factions and Earthers, Martians, Inners, Belters, etc. gets a bit tiring. The world right now is in a grim state (Palestine, Ukraine, ...), so I could use some peacemaking and getting along with each other, even if it's only fictional. What I particularly like about The Expanse compared to many other sci-fi shows is that the space travel actually seems believable. Having said that, I also starting watching the **Dune** movie, because part 2 was just released in the cinema and I want to see it, but need to catch up first. It's bombastic, slow, theatrical opera. Quite enjoyable, but I need to be in the right mood to be able to sit through it.\n- We are starting our **apartment selling** process. Last week we went to Gothenburg to receive the keys from our tenants and now we're looking for a m√§klare. Hemnet is of course _the_ Swedish real estate site, and all apartments look idential: white, minimalistic, styled, unpersonal. So ours needs to look like that as well. Currently it's completely empty and perhaps needs a paint job. But I don't want to paint over our nice Tapetorama wall papers: one graphic, one slightly childish one with thunderstorm clouds. \n- **IDLES** concert in Copenhagen was fun, but we left halfway through because I didn't feel well and standing in a crowd of drunk, smelly people, not seeing a thing on stage didn't help. Another concert that was a lot more chill was **Elin Piel **in Inkonst - ambient modular synth music.\n- Had a consultancy call about **mycoprotein**. It's nice to still be a little connected to the alternative protein and fungal cultivation field. If anything, it gives me a reason to keep myself updated. \n- My cousin Carina and her boyfriend visited Malm√∂, which was very nice. We went to some fantastic restaurants - one of which (Rue Hamra Meza Beirut) literally filled the whole table with platters of (vegetarian) mezze. \n- The oatgurt that I helped develop finally launched. Currently only in the DACH market and Netherlands, but I hope that we can also get it in Sweden soon. I love it, it's the best vegan yogurt I've ever had (totally unbiased, obvs). \n![|500](projects/attachments/IMG_20240209_145557.jpg)\n\n\n## w7 2024\n- Happy Chinese New Year! Baohong at work brought some Chinese sweets to celebrate. \n- Tuesday was Fettisdagen/Faschingsdienstag/Shrove Tuesday, which in Sweden of course means semla. I had pre-ordered a semla at our local bakery Farina, but just when I wanted to pick it up I got a text that their booking system had messed up and I wouldn't get my semla today (but could pick up a free one any other day in the next 2 weeks). To be honest, I wasn't too sad about it because semlor are quite rich and creamy and I wasn't in the mood for that on Tuesday evening. So I'm still looking forward to my yearly semla. I'll report back next week. \n- Yesterday was the first sunny day in a weeks filled with dreary grey sky, rain and wind. What a difference! We had \"maintenance day\" planned, a quarterly day where we fix things in the apartment. I repotted some plants, we put non-slippy things on the carpets and felt-things on the scratchy chair legs, Duncan sharpened the knives, and I cleaned all the windows. We also semi-successfully tried to beat the carpets and mattress on the balcony. \n- **Grandaddy's Blue Wav** album was released this week, and it's of course lovely üíï Quite heart-breaky and melancholic, but very sweet.\n- We went to see **Alessandro Cortini** in Inkonst on Friday - synth music in a dark room with cool visuals. The bass was _insane_, I've never felt music that much. At times I was wondering if it was still healthy. Not the volume, but the amount of vibration that I felt in my whole body. Quite an experience. \n- I ordered 120 L of gardening soil for my upcoming balcony project. I've been collecting inspiration and information about what to grow and how, e.g. here: [General balcony gardening tips](projects/plants/General%20balcony%20gardening%20tips.md), [Inspiration pictures](projects/plants/Inspiration%20pictures.md), and [Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md). I got the soil delivered from Bauhaus, because I didn't want to drag it halfway across the city on a bus. \n- Today it's [Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)-making day with Anna.\n## w6 2024\n- I went to the cinema again for the first time since before the pandemic! It was very nice. Went with my friend Anna to see **Perfect Days**, a Wim Wenders movie about a public toilet cleaner in Tokyo. Calm and slow, almost meditative. \n- We saw a music and light show in St. Pauli church in Malm√∂. The music was described as \"deep house techno ambient undervattenk√§nsla\". It lasted 50 min and I got into a nice state of calmness and reflection. I thought about the benefit of being \"forced\" to sit with yourself and your thoughts for an hour, and that religion and church services - if I have *anything* good to say about them - can provide that. \n- My woodcraft course started, after it had to be postpones by a week because of a \"blizzard\". I learned how to use table saw, mitre saws and drill press, how to join corners and insert splines, how to measure things well, how to rip and cut wood, etc. It's fun and we are a very nice small group of people. \n- For Stefan and Stephan Stefan's 40th birthday party I went to Austria. I booked a capsule in the √ñBB Nightjet capsule wagons and really enjoyed it. The only downside really was the cold air ventilation that robbed me of my sleep on the way to Vienna. On the way back I wore my jacket the whole night and was very cosy. Vienna was spring-like with up to 14 c and sunshine. Was nice to see old friends - Martina, Stephan, Stefan, Michi, Teresa, Berntsch, Lebi - even though it felt a bit stiff and school reunion-like at times. Mama, Papa and Luna came also, and we had lunch and coffee with Tante Irmi and Onkel Bertram (who had just fallen down the stairs a few days earlier and had his head wrapped in gauze). \n- With Angie I went to Gartenbaukino and saw **Poor Things**. Crazy, lots of explicit sex scenes, and surprisingly fun. \n- Finished reading **Craig Mod's [Things Become Other Things](projects/books/Things%20Become%20Other%20Things.md)**. Loved the mix of autobiography, descriptions of Japan and the beautiful photos. Really a work of art this book. I read it slowly over a few weeks to really enjoy it and not race through (though you _could_ read it in 2h). It made me REALLY want to go on a multi-day walk again this spring, but not sure if we can fit it into our schedule with work and family visits and the Gothenburg apartment sale.\n\n![|400](private/attachments/capsule%2003.jpg)\n\n## w3 2024\n- I got a haircut! I have a **fringe** now, and a mid-parting. My millenial self has to be strong not to swipe the hair to the side again. Slowly getting used to the look and the feeling of hair constantly hanging just above my eyes. But I thought it's nice with a change sometimes.\n- Moving to Sk√•ne, and especially Southern Sk√•ne, I really expected to not see snow in the winter at all. But this year so far has been kind to me. When we moved to Malm√∂ in November, I made a bet with Duncan walking past the lake in Pildammsparken that it will never completely freeze over. Already a few weeks later I was proven wrong because we had a period with snow and freezing temperatures. Then over Christmas it was warm and wet again, but almost the whole of January now has been below 0 and on-and-off snow. There were even a few dramatic scenes on motorways nearby where people were stuck in a blizzard for a day, and my first woodworking class was cancelled because of too much snowfall.\n- Speaking of **woodworking**. I signed up for the beginner's class at [https://www.refablab.com/](RefabLab). Partly because I just want to meet people here, and partly because I miss pottering around in a workshop. I also got an afternoon of pottery class for Christmas from Duncan. He's already very well integrated into some things here in Malm√∂ due to the modular synthesizer community here, but I still need to find some connections. Sports clubs are not so my thing, even though playing in a team is probably the quickest way to make some close connections. I'll see if there is anything around crafting, fermentation, walking/hiking, gardening, refurbishing, etc. out there. Malm√∂ seems to be a city with a lot of different initatives - people that just try and start something; that feels nice. \n- Angie was here for a long weekend and it was fun to show her around. We ate Bento boxes at Mitt M√∂llan, had nice coffee at Caf√© Jesusbaren, walked along the snowy beach, went shopping (incl. in the dozens of second hand shops here), looked at Konsthall, etc. \n![](private/attachments/DSCF9407.jpeg)\n\n![|400](private/attachments/photo_2024-01-21%2009.59.11.jpeg)\n- I really enjoy playing/learning to play the **guitar** right now. In summer we bought a bright red electric guitar (Stratocaster-like?) on Tradera and first I tried JustinGuitar's app for learning. It was good and his teaching style is great, but somehow I didn't get hooked. Then I tried Yousician, and I LOVE it! It's much more gamified, bascially GuitarHero with some exercises in between. But it's so much fun to play along songs and get an immediate feedback how good you were, etc. Unfortunately I hurt my finger somehow a few weeks ago, probably Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and it's been burning and unpleasant ever since. Resting the hand over Christmas didn't do much, so I just started gently playing again. I warm up my hand now before every session with a squeezy ball, and that seems to help. Or it's just that the healing process takes longer than expected. I want to play some Interpol and Strokes and Muse, and maybe also post-rock kind of stuff like Radio Dept. \n- New Year feels already like so long ago... We spent a week in **Skillingaryd** in Sm√•land, far away from the fireworks craziness of M√∂llev√•ngstorget. Two days were very soggy, the other days were nice and snowy. Laika had a bad belly on the 29th, Duncan had a MASSIVE migraine on the 30th (likely partially caused by getting up several times in the night because of Laika), but on the 31st everyone was well again. We cooked noodle soup and watched The Big Fat Quiz of the Year on Youtube, an episode of Scavenger's Reign, and played a few Nanograms. Extremely chill New Year's eve. The train ride back home was calm and pleasant, very different from the train ride to Skillingaryd where I was trying to contain a Laika shaking with adrenalin for 2 hours because we shared the seats with two cats in carriers. \n![|400](private/attachments/IMG_20240101_094139.jpg)\n- I tried some lino cut. \n- Started listening to **Flashback Forever** podcast. Mostly to train my Swedish, and I also like the Gothenburg accent of the hosts. Lots of LOLs. I've also watched **Love is Blind Sverige**, which was pretty awful and cringy. **The Expanse** continues to be excellent, I'm on season 3 now. I also started reading **Jag √Ñr Zlatan** to both practice Swedish and learn more about Malm√∂'s famous son. I'm one chapter in, where he basically only rants about how he is so awesome and his Spanish coach doesn't see that. \n## w50 2023\n- It's been a while! We've mostly been busy with moving and settling in our new home in Malm√∂. We love it here so far: very nice area (M√∂llev√•ngen), cool stuff to do, great restaurants, nice parks nearby (Pildammsparken, Folkets Park). We already know some nice people here, hang out with our neighbours who have a small Samoyed puppy, I signed up for Friskis gym and woodworking classes, we already went to several music gigs, etc. \n- I just tested positive for the big C :(  I managed to avoid it for 3 years, and now caught it probably at the Christmas party a few days ago. Don't feel toooo bad. During the night I felt quite feverish, but now I'm just a bit drowsy and have a sore throat. \n- It snowed here properly a few weeks ago! In Malm√∂! Didn't think that would happen, let alone in November. We went out at 11 pm and walked around the park. The snow was SO soft and fluffy and gorgeous, omg. It lasted for about a week, because it was consistently below -5C. But now it's back to Sk√•ne winter of 4C and drizzle.\n- Started watching **The Expanse** after consulting Reddit if I should read the books first or watch the TV show. Reddit was very split, but what convinced me to start watching was a comment that there are many good sci-fi books out there, but not that many really great sci-fi TV shows. And so far I love it! It feels the most realistic sci-fi I've watched (ever?). Starting on Season 2 today, because that's what's being ill is for! There was one thing in particular that I remember from one early episode from the first season, where a guy from the Belt and from Earth have a discussion, and the Belter asks something like \"Why the hell did you ever leave Earth? To have the SKY above you, you breathe fresh AIR, you feel real RAIN instead of being locked up in a habitation hub!\". And it made me think of the Mars colonisation bullshit that dickheads like Musk are trying to make a thing. Years ago I was fascinated by it because I like(d) all things space, but realising how we so incredibly stupidly destroy the Earth, and then as a solution it's suggested to colonise and geoengineer Mars?!?!! What the actual fuck. \n- We also started with **Welcome to Wrexham**, about the Welsh football club that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought. It's surprisingly heartwarming and makes me almost want to be really into football. \n- Books I've read lately: \n\t- **How big things get done*** (Bent Flyvbjerg). Bit repetitive, as most non-fiction books that want to \"get a point across\", but still enjoyable and interesting. In short, more planning and more buffer (both time and money) would make projects succeed better. \n\t- **Masala Lab: The science of Indian cooking** (Krish Ashok). Had to stop a quarter through. The writing was insufferable. The author things he's funny, doesn't get to the point, talks things up to \"uuh, watch out, science!\" etc. Bah.\n\t- **A prayer for the crown-shy** (Becky Chambers). Lovely, very similar to the first Monk \u0026 Robot book. I love her writing and the way she describes things. So evocative without  being poetic or flowery or too much. \n\t- **The Immortalists** (Chloe Benjamin). Got that one from the library on a whim. Ok story about some kids getting told their time of death and how their lives unfold thereafter. Some things are a bit ham-handed, and there's not really a tense story arc going on, but I still finished it. Somewhat forgettable though.\n\t- **All systems red** (Martha Wells). First one of the Murderbot diaries. I started the second one and then realised that I should probably read the first one first. Nice original take on the whole human-androids-augments-robots thing, self-determinance, etc. Dry humour and still quite good sci-fi elements. Liked it. I just read that they're going to make an Apple TV show out of it starring Alexander Skarsg√•rd, but in my mind the murderbot was always female...?\n## w38 2023\n- Duncan got **Covid** after going to England and was pretty ill for a while. We (successfully?) quarantined and isolated at home, and I spent the last two weeks sleeping in the living room while he didn't really leave the bedroom. Now the trees outside are turning yellow, the air is getting crisp and his Covid tests are finally coming back negative again. \n- I fancied reading a book in German again, so I went to the library with my dad who visited a few weeks ago. I got **\"F\" by Daniel Kehlmann**, and I really enjoyed it. Particularly the hilariously accurate descriptions of the catholic church service - it really reminded me of my childhood. \n- I miss **winter** ‚ùÑÔ∏è. Moving to Southern Sweden, close to the coast, as well as climate change makes the winters I experience more and more snow-less. Here in Sk√•ne winter is just dark, windy and wet, around 3C and perpetually overcast. Sometimes I lie in bed in the morning, when it's dark and my eyes are still closed, and I imagine being at home in Austria, 30 years ago, early morning, and just hear the \"kkschrrr, kksschrrr\" of someone shovelling snow in front of their house. And then I get incredibly nostalgic. I need to see and experience snow again this winter. Last winter we didn't go anywhere snowy and we had literally two mornings in Helsingborg where it was white on the ground (and gone by midday). \n- In preparation of a nice winter holiday, Duncan made something that I've been meaning to make for ages: [a map of Sweden that shows train lines and supermarkets](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/radioedit/clmw71b9g02ni01nz5nut01yv.html?title=view\u0026access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoicmFkaW9lZGl0IiwiYSI6ImNpZ2F4NGw1MzFhaDd0Zmx5NGtoaXBnZTgifQ.LKXJIMW7qqWDRD8QCnMqaw\u0026zoomwheel=true\u0026fresh=true#6.69/62.379/13.295). This makes it **so** much easier to plan trips where we want to go by public transport, but also not be too far away from the nearest place to buy food. \n\n## w35 2023\n- I learned the other days something fascinating about **raspberry pollination**. The reason why you sometimes see wonky little raspberries that just consist of a few segments (druplet) is insufficient pollination. Basically every single druplet of a raspberry (or blackberry, etc.) is a fruit and had its own pistil that needed to be pollinated. A nice, full, mature raspberry has 100-200 druplets. \n## w33 2023\n- We've had a **Thermomix TM5** now for a bit more than a month, thanks to my work having one old one \"left over\" that I could borrow. At first we only used it for a few things and it felt more like a hassle to try to integrate it into our cooking routines. But the past two weeks we've been cooking almost exclusively Thermomix-specific recipes from the [Cookidoo](https://cookidoo.international/foundation/en) website, and I'm starting to see the benefit of having this gadget in the kitchen. I particularly like it for starting a cooking process by just throwing in a whole onion, some garlic cloves and some spices and oil, and then letting it chop and simmer while you prepare other stuff. It definitely shines when you make things like stews and soups, or also risottos, where frequent stirring on a medium heat over longer time is desired. It's not the easiest thing to clean, so recipes with multiple \"chop, take out, clean, put in another ingredient\" cycles are a bit annoying. In [Thermomix recipes](projects/cooking/Thermomix%20recipes.md) I have collected some of my favourite recipes so far and some that we are about to try. \n## w32 2023\n- So it looks like we have found an **apartment in Malm√∂**! The Swedish rental market amazes/confuses me once again... So I have about 2 years of queueing points on different sites. Very occasionally an apartment has come up during the last 3ish months of searching that I kind of liked. I visited three (four, if you count the one where we were stuck on a train somewhere near K√§vlinge for an hour and missed the viewing): one was claustrophobic and above a heavy smoker, one was amazing but too expensive (though in hindsight we probably should have taken it) and one was cute, a bit oddly shaped and in a great location. For that last one we were on spot 19 when the viewing was taking place. During the viewing some people dropped out and I moved to spot 12. Over the next few days I first got to 9, then to 6. Still not much hope though. Then I was 3, and the message on Boplats said that they were checking the first one in queue for eligibility. Then I was 2, same message. And then during the end of last week I was on spot 1 and the message said that we might get it and that the housing organisation is checking our eligibility. WHAT? How did that happen? Yes, there is a strange little extra room that is half-attached to the living room. And the kitchen is fairly small. But other than that? What's wrong with the apartment? Or what's wrong with the other people in the queue ahead of me? Yes, there are some standard requirements, like not smoking anywhere in or near the building, earning at least twice the monthly rent, and some stranger ones like having a job that is less than 2h commute away. But still...? Well anyway, we got it! They'll send the contract in a few days! And I'm excited and have been watching home styling videos all weekend. I'm a bit sad to leave the considerably greener Helsingborg behind, but also chuffed about having a bit more lively city life again, meeting more people with similar interests, etc. \n- At work I've been doing more **lactic acid bacteria** stuff. I spread some yogurt on selective plates to be able to determine how many live bacteria are in it at different points during shelf life. Looks pretty good, I counted about 10^9 per g product on day 1 and then there's a steady decline to about 10^7 after 3 months. A billion bacteria PER GRAM! And that's not even that much. It's always mind boggling how much life there is in _everything_. \n- I gave audiobooks another try after watching a compelling video about **[the best books of 2023 so far](https://youtu.be/yu-o0uOylDA)**. I've had a lot of 60ies sci-fi lately and fancied a bit more contemporary stuff. Instead of the dreaded Audible I tried Xig Xag, which has a different payment system (you pay per book) and is not tied to a subscription. They had **Pod** by Laline Paull, which had high marks. But after listening to it now for 3+ hours, I'm not sure I want to continue. It's a bit boring and scattered. Lots of fish being nasty to each other. \n- In parallel I'm also listening to **Sommaren 1985** by John Ajvide Linqvist, whose other books L√•t den r√§tte komma in and M√§nniskohamn I absolutely loved. So far it's nice, but also more coming-of-age and less tense thriller than I'd like. They found a creepy mermaid, so hopefully something develops there. I don't get _everything_ of the Swedish, but enough to follow along. And it's very good practice. \n- The weather continues to be a bit dismal here in Sk√•ne. While everywhere else is breaking records with either temperature (Hottest July ever! Hottest sea surface temperature ever!) or floodings or forest fires, Sk√•ne continues to be windy and rainy at a more or less constant 13-16C. So it feels wrong to complain, but it would also be nice to have a few summery days. After the dreadful winter (windy, rainy) I'm longing for some more distinct seasons.\n- I got my passport back! And I've had the most Austrian interactions in a while with the people from the embassies (both in Stockholm and Copenhagen) - chill, jovial, slightly incompetent but well-meaning. A bit like [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/15ob4bd/trafik√ºberfall_in_graz_mariatrost/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=web2x\u0026context=3) of a recent armed robbery in Graz. \n - There was some buzz about an apparent room-temperature superconductor from a Korean lab. Besides the fact that it was only published on arXiv and no one has managed to replicate it yet... Why are people SO excited about it? Woah, we can build maglev trains now! Well, we can already build _normal_ trains now that are fast and efficient (if maintained properly). But still many countries and governments don't. This is a solved problem (on the technical side).\n\n\n## w30 2023\n- In week 29 I went to a Finnish town called **Kouvola** for a work trip, a 1.5 h drive from Helsinki. Lost my passport somewhere on the way there. Otherwise the trip was good, even though on the first day it looked like we had come for nothing because one pump in the factory didn't work. But the pump was fixed the next day and my colleague and I rebooked out flights to late on Wednesday, so we could finish the trial. It was an interesting experience going from a lab-made product to a factory scale - there are so many new challenges that I didn't anticipate. Mostly that there is water in all the pipes that needs to be pushed out before product can travel in them, thereby potentially diluting your recipe. And the all the loss at different stages, because the ends and starts of pumping product from tank A to tank B are usually discarded. Definitely some optimisation that could be done there. \n- Finished reading **Story of Your Life and Others** by Ted Chiang. Over the last year he's become one of my favourite writers. He just combined sci-fi and maths and history and philosophy in such a unique way. And I love the unusual settings, like a construction site of the tower of Babel or a industrial age factory with clay golems. I preferred his other short story collection [Exhalation](projects/books/Exhalation.md), just because the stories seemed a bit more finished and self-contained there, but I really enjoyed it. My favourites were The Tower of Babel and Story of Your Life, which was the basis for the film Arrival. \n- Started learning **bass**, because Duncan is doing an online tutorial (and recently bought a bass second hand) and asked if I wanted to try a few lessons. It's fun to play an instrument again. Not sure if the bass is my thing though. I am not very good in even picking out the bassline in a song. I somehow feels like it's almost dispensable. And it's usually very repetitive to play. It doesn't have the same impact as the guitar it seems. But maybe that's just my newbie ignorance. \n- Apparently **chicken-of-the-woods** tastes more chicken than chicken itself (according to some dude on Reddit). That was enough to get me very intrigued. Now looking into if I can find it somewhere here in Sweden, or grow it. Is it possible to grow it in larger scale, like on sawdust? Or even submerged? \n- It was my **birthday**! I got a personalised Heinz ketchup bottle, a mini whisk and mini spatula to scrape out jam jars, the book \"How big things get done\", a very nice green pair of Fairphone headphones, some golden iron-on patches to cover stains, and Korean BB cream. Duncan and I went to Chay, the amazing vegan Vietnamese place in town, bought some cakey treats at Bruket Kaffebar, then I cycled to the beach with Luciane and even went into the water twice (a refreshing 16C!), played some Zelda, read a bit, chatted with family, had meze for dinner and watched an episode of Strange New Worlds. Pretty much a perfect day. \n- The summer in Sweden has been a somewhat underwhelming so far (usually 12-28C and showers, windy, drizzly, overcast), but I can't really complain because other parts of the world are literally on fire and July was the hottest month _ever_ in human history. \n\n## w28 2023\n- SO MUCH **Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**. I'm trying to not rush it because I want to explore every corner of the map first. \n- I finished reading **[New York 2140](projects/books/New%20York%202140.md)**. I'm glad I read it, because I like to read more somewhat realistic (and ideally utopian/solar punk) climate fiction. But I have to be honest and admit that I didn't really like it and wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Towards the end I skimmed entire pages because I got tired of characters just talking to each other while some of the (imo) more exciting plot lines were hung out to dry. [The Ministry for the Future](projects/books/The%20Ministry%20for%20the%20Future.md) is better, even though I would probably also criticise that there is too much filler conversation going on. My preference for writing styles is concise and saying a lot in a few sentences. Carefully crafted sentences, without sounding overly lyrical. Some examples that I read are anything Ursula K. LeGuin, [The Mountain in the Sea](projects/books/The%20Mountain%20in%20the%20Sea.md), or some Japanese writers like Banana Yoshimoto.  \n- Bought some **chayote** and some **green papaya**, because they had it in my local Asian shop. I had never used green papaya myself, and never even heard of chayote. I fermented them ([Chayote - plain and Jamaican-style](projects/fermentation/Chayote%20-%20plain%20and%20Jamaican-style.md), [Green papaya Thai-style](projects/fermentation/Green%20papaya%20Thai-style.md)): The chayote kept its crunch nicely but doesn't really have any own flavour (both good and bad). The papaya is also crunchy while also having a slightly fruity note. Next up is a big green squash that I found in the Middle Eastern shop. \n- I made another **[Stacker Jacket](projects/sewing/Stacker%20Jacket.md)**. It's so crazy to construct a lined jacket, especially at the stage where everything is inside out and sewn together with four sleeves sticking out in different directions. Then you just pull it all through a tiny hole in the lining and out comes a fancy jacket. I just have the buttons left to attach, and I'm dreading it. The jacket looks perfect right now, I might mess it all up with the buttons and those damned buttonholes. \n- While having all the sewing stuff out, I also made a **[Donny shirt](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt.md)** from leftover linen fabric from my [Tula pants \u0026 shorts (Papercut Patterns)](projects/sewing/Tula%20pants%20\u0026%20shorts%20(Papercut%20Patterns).md). Everyone online said it's \"such a quick sew!\" but it took me probably like 8-10 hours altogether. I re-watched **Foundation season 1** while sewing. Such a good show! And season 2 is coming out soon, which is why I wanted to refresh my memory. \n- Speaking of TV shows: **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds** season 2 is also out now. We tried to watch the first episode the other day and realised we had no clue what actually happened in the last season. So we watched a recap video on Youtube. Now I feel better prepared and I'm really excited to start watching because the first season was SO GOOD!\n\n\n## w22 2023\n- Some learnings from planning, booking and now being in the middle of a 3 week train travel through Europe (Sweden-Denmark-Germany-Netherlands-Belgium-Luxembourg-Germany-Austria-Germany-Sweden). With our dog üê∂.\n\t- _Don't chain trains._ Delays **will** occur. It's so much nicer, and less stressful to stop more frequently, only have a few hours of train travel each day, arrive in the next destination earlier in the day and have a chance to explore it a bit. Also, delays won't bother you if you don't have to catch another train. More time to read! \n\t- _Don't be overly ambitious_. We usually left a place at around 10, that leaves time for a nice breakfast and morning walk. Then buy a snack, get on the train for a few hours. Dog sleeps, we read, listen, watch, chat, snooze, eat. Early afternoon, we arrive, walk to the hotel, drop off our stuff, rest a bit and then head out for exploring the city and look for a nice caf√© or restaurant for early dinner. \n\t- _Pick **one** thing to see in each place_. Even in the most boring seeming places, there is _something_ to explore. It's good to look that thing up before you arrive, so the visits in the various places are not all just aimless wandering. It can be nice to aimlessly wander, but it also gets a bit tiring. For example in Kolding, we visited the model village [Miniby](https://koldingminiby.dk/da_dk/) and the botanical garden around it. In Hamburg, we went to the [Speicherstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherstadt). In Utrecht, we walked along the Oude and Nieuwe Gracht. \n\t- _Bring snacks/food and water._ See above: train delays **will** occur. Therefore, always have water and some snacks on you. M√ºsli bars, some nice bread rolls, nuts, whatever. Don't bring chocolate, it might melt. \n\t- _Print out all the tickets_. I did get all the 15 different apps for the 10 different inter-European train agencies, but to be honest, I still felt safer printing out all the tickets and bringing them with me. The evening before I take out the tickets for tomorrow's train, check the time again, and put the print-out in the front pocket of my bagpack. Then during the train ride, I can use it as a bookmark, note down interesting things to see or restaurants to go to in the next destination, and have it handy when/if the train conductor comes (Which so far has not happened! No one has checked any of our tickets so far!). \n\t- _One luggage person, one dog person._ I took a small wheely suitcase and a bagpack, and Duncan took a duffle bag and a bagpack. And then there's Laika. In hindsight it would've been much smarter to put all our stuff into **one** (larger?) wheely suitcase. One person takes the suitcase, gets it on the train and stows it away. The other person takes the dog. Sometimes doggo needs to be carried into the train (many people, large gaps/steps) and having additional luggage is really annoying. Duncan ended up taking the duffle AND the suitcase, which is fine for a bit, but next time we'll pool. \n\t- _The biggest cities are not always the best to stop_. We already learned this during planning when the hotel prices in Copenhagen were SO much higher than in 2-hours-further-South Kolding. But also Hamburg was a bit too stressful for my liking. The station is disgusting and a mess, and the way to the hostel was quite unpleasant as well. In contrast, Osnabr√ºck was a chill little town with a nice, walkable centre. The other advantage of getting on the train a bit away from the transport hubs is that the train stations are calmer. \n\t- _RESERVE SEATS!!!_ Can't stress this enough. I would **never** attempt a trans-European train travel without seat reservations. An exception are maybe commuter trains that run every 15-30 min. \n\n\n## w17 2023\n- The Netherlands produces an astonishing amount of food, both vegetables and meat. Here's an article that portrays the scale of it, and describes how it runs actually very energy- and resource-efficiently (or as good as possible): https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/netherlands-agriculture-technology/\n\n\n## w16 2023\n- This week I refreshed my Phython pandas knowledge to analyse and plot some fermentation data. From work I have a lot of recordings of fermentation pH and temperature values over time, and most of them are in huge Excel sheets and it's a pain to analyse by hand. But I'm always in this dilemma that my datasets are still small enough to be able to do it by hand, and it's usually faster than sitting down and trying to figure out how to program a pipeline for analysis, that would make things quicker in the long run. Anyway, I finally had some time and watched a few Youtube videos about pandas, and followed some tutorials about [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/. And - tataaa - I have now sucessfully created a Jupyter notebook with a pipeline that cleanes up my data, calculates some essential things, and then creates a nice graph. It still needs some improvements, like some loops over iterative file names, but in general I'm pretty happy that I managed to produce something useful. \n![|500](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230416160548.png)\n\n- I finished reading the **thick** novel **Jade City**. It was recommended somewhere, and I saw it in the library a few weeks ago and just took it. I expected more fantasy elements; it's essentially a family and clan saga about mafia structures in a tropical, Shanghai-y/Hongkong-y island nation. Yes, they get certain powers by being in contact with jade, but that's basically all that is different from the real world. If you substitute *jade* with *drugs* it would just be a gangster/mafia stroy. There's lots of underground trading logistics, street fighting, fulfilling family traditions, rivalry, etc. I did enjoy reading it, because the characters and the story were described in a very vivid way, but I won't read the rest of the trilogy. Too much other stuff to read. \n- While reading Jade City, I got a bit annoyed - as I do ocassionally with other stories about \"alternative realities\" - that the power structures in the fictional nation were quite similar to existing power structures in the real world. Like, why don't authors paint more diverse visions of fictional societies, but instead always fall back to the common \"men are in power, women are not as well regarded, foreigners are suspicious\" bla bla bla. It's so tiring. Same in Jade City, where one of the few main female characters is an incredibly talented jade fighter, but there is constantly this undercurrent of her not being taken seriously, having to convince people much more than her brothers, not being considered for certain roles because she's a woman, etc. However, at the end of the book there was actually an interview with the author, explaining that this setting was deliberate to make it seem more realistic and relatable, instead of creating a _complete_ fantasy-world. I can understand that, though I would generally really appreciate more escapism in novels and descriptions of worlds that are a bit more diverse - in whatever way - than our current one. Isn't the whole point of making up fictional worlds that you can think up different ways of how things are run?\n- A good summary of [what to do with preserved lemons](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/11/what-else-are-preserved-lemons-good-for-kitchen-aide)\n\n\n## w15 2023\n- This Easter weekend, we walked a half of **Sk√•neleden North to South:** [SL2 Nord till syd](trips/SL2%20Nord%20till%20syd.md). It was not only a nice walk, but I also learned a lot about the history of Sk√•ne and the areas we walked through, observed trees, birds and insects, visited the geographical centre of Sk√•ne and the location of Sweden's oldest settlement, and got to know several new mid-sized towns (H√§ssleholm, H√∂√∂r, H√∂rby). \n\n![|400](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2060%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n\n## w12 2023\n- Finished watching **The Last of Us**. I thought it was excellently made. The way it keeps you on your toes, without being _too_ graphic or scary most of the time. And the way it has calm epidoses in between the faster ones. It was actually much more slow-paced than I had expected, but that makes the fast scenes even more exciting and important. Something I have problems with in newer Star Trek series, like Discovery: there's no time to take a breath, every single incident is threatening the whole of the universe, etc. You just get tired of the high stakes and everything becomes a bit meaningless. Thankfully, they manage to get to a better balance (and better storytelling) again in the newest (third) **Picard** season - it's really good! I'm halfway through the season.\n- Also started watching the BBC show **Race Across the World**. I LOVED season 1. During the midst of the pandemic in 2020, I was really craving pictures and impressions from other countries and cultures, and it was so nice to follow 5 teams as they make their way over land (and sea) from London, via Greece and Central Asia, to China, Vietnam and finally Singapore. It was varied, both in terms of transport, nature and culture. Season 2 was North to South from Mexico City to Ushuaia, and it was also good but a looot of bus travel, since that's the only mode of public transport available in a lot of places in Central and South America. So we'll see how season 3 plays out now, where the teams travel from Vancouver to St. John's on Newfoundland, via Yukon and Northern Manitoba. So far, car sharing seems to be *the* way to go in Canda, at least in the part where they're starting from. The nature is amazing, of course. It somewhat scratches my travel itch, but it also makes me long to go to all of these places. \n- Inspired by Race Across the World, I read about **Haida Gwaii** and found several interesting documentaries I want to watch: [Haida Gwaii: On the Edge of the World](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/haidagwaii), [Hadwin's Judgement](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/hadwinsjudgement) and [Canda Over the Edge: Haida Gwaii South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBNlrk59bZ8). \n\n\n## w11 2023\n- We visited [Dalby S√∂derskog](trips/Dalby%20S√∂derskog.md) on a half-rainy Saturday. It's Europe's smallest National Park, and it is indeed tiny. But still interesting to walk through, and especially to observe and discover all the things that grow and thrieve on and around dead wood. \n- [Crown shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness): \n \u003e Crown shyness is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavrious, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.\n \n Crown shyness observed in Dalby S√∂derskog:\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8333.jpeg)\n\n- \n\n\n\n## w10 2023\n- The discovery of vast - and somewhat renewable - **hydrogen reservoirs** ([article in Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)) all over the world might mean a possible greener future, sooner than with electric conversion alone. This sounds very exciting! I'm already dreaming of travelling without a bad conscience in planes that sprinkle water droplets out of their engines.\n- I've been reading (and really enjoying) **[The Mountain in the Sea](projects/books/The%20Mountain%20in%20the%20Sea.md)** lately, and **connectomes** and brain mappings are a central part of the plot. Interesting (and somewhat scary?) that the real world is catching up: The brain of a 6 hour old Drosphila fly has been mapped and a connectome created ([article in Nature](https://www.science.org/content/article/hidden-hydrogen-earth-may-hold-vast-stores-renewable-carbon-free-fuel)). The researchers found some resemblance with how neural networks work: \n\u003e _\"The team also found that 41% of the brain neurons form ‚Äòrecurrent loops‚Äô, providing feedback to their upstream partners. These shortcuts and loops resemble state-of-the-art artificial neural networks that are being used in artificial-intelligence research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting that the computer-science field is converging onto what evolution has discovered,‚Äù says Cardona.\". _\n\n\n\n## w9 2023\n- I've been reading a LOT about [Lactic acid bacteria](projects/science/Lactic%20acid%20bacteria.md) lately. Partly to reactivate a little dataviz project that I'm working on, partly because I also need it for work, and partly because I am of course interested in all things fermentation. The Lactobacillus genus recently went through a reorganization of the taxonomy, and there's a great [video/seminar](https://youtu.be/ErQbie690po) (by The Fermentation Association) with one of the authors about why it was done and what the new genera are. \n- For a while, **One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez has been on my to-read list. So I got the audiobook (in German) and started, but after about 6 hours of listening I have to say that it's just not for me (and I decided to skip the remaining 12 hours). It's a nice evocative language and I do like the [magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism) style. But every other person is called Jos√© or Arcadio Buendia (which just makes everything unnecessarily tedious to follow), and the story just trickles along without any build-up to anything, and there's some yucky marrying children stuff going on, and in general I just got incredibly bored by the whole thing. Not how I want to spend my time, when there's so many other great books to read. The historical background of South America in the 19th and early 20th century would have been interesting, but it was impossible to know what was actual and what was fictional. \n- One book that I did enjoy a lot was **A Psalm for the Wild-Built** (great title!). I saw it being described as \"cosy core\", and I like that. It's futuristic, utopian, solar punk, but very gentle and connected to nature. The main character is a tea monk, travelling around to find a purpose, and meeting a robot on the way. Best to read with a steaming cup of tea on the side. üçµ\n\n## w7 2023\n- Started watching **The Last of Us** about escaping the zombie pandemic caused by a filamentous fungi (the creepy [Cordyceps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps?useskin=vector) that replaces host tissue with mycelium). I really enjoy it, especially the video-gamey scenes, like when one of the protagonists snipes at hordes of zombies from a high-rise so that his friends can reach a safe zone.\n- We finally decided on where to walk for this year's Easter Hike (this is becoming a tradition after [[Gotaleden]] in 2021 and [Kullaleden](trips/Kullaleden.md) in 2022). It's going to be part of [Sk√•neleden](trips/Sk√•neleden.md), the Northern half of the North-to-South route, 133 km from Vittsj√∂ to H√∂rby.\n- I finished my [Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md)!! They look great and it was a very satisfying project, as the pattern is very precise and has some nice sharp corners, and the Youtube tutorial is top notch. I'm already living in these trousers. üëñ The only annoying thing was - as usual - the buttonhole. It's just _impossible_ to get anything bulkier than 2 layers under the buttonhole presserfoot. In the end I did the buttonhole \"manually\" by sewing two narrow rows of zig-zag stitching and connected them with a wider stitch. \n\n## w5 2023\n- **Mycoremediation** - cleaning the environment with fungi - seems very appealing. And a lot of people are hoping that fungi can be found that can \"eat up\" plastic on land and in the ocean. Prompted by the question in the Future Ecologies Discord channel if there are any large-scale projects going on in that area, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole: [Bioremediation with fungi](fungi/Bioremediation%20with%20fungi.md). In short, there are loads of studies that show that some fungal strain can degrade a particular, isolated plastic in a specific form (often soluble), at a specific concentration under specific conditions (often with the pH and temperature adjusted and necessary trace elements added). The problem with a real life application is that plastics are very resistant to chemical (and therefore also enzymatic) attack, usually come mixed together with other polymers, are found in difficult environments (ocean, landfills) with or without oxygen, etc. Preparing the substrate in a way that the fungi will just gobble it up, is tricky and costly. Another (in most papers unanswered) question is if the breakdown products are actually less harmful in the environment than the plastic polymer. Will fungal degradation release e.g. plasticizers that then leak into waterways? Will the fungi themselves become toxic? (There is this idea that oyster mushroom could grow on trash and then be eaten - is that healthy?) Fungi also release CO2 and throught he plastic degradation also potentially methane and other substances - is that better or worse for the environment than leaving the carbon more sequestered as a polymer?\n- On the weekend we went with Laika to a **dog bakery** in Gothenburg. It was ridiculous and wonderful. I had red velvet cake for the first time and was a bit disappointed. It looks more impressive than it tastes. Or maybe a dog bakery is not the best place to evaluate cakes for humans?\n\n## w4 2023\n- Really enjoying the [Scales of Change](https://www.futureecologies.net/dragons) series of the [Future Ecologies](https://www.futureecologies.net/#home-section) podcast. Signed up for their Patreon, since it includes a Discord membership that seems pretty nice. \n- A job fair for plant-centric food producers https://terra.do/climate-jobs/climate-job-fair/terra-do-plant-futures-initiative-job-fair-2023-02-17/\n- I attended my first hackathon this week! (I know, so 2011...) It was organised by [Foo Caf√©](https://foocafe.org/) in Malm√∂ and was about protein folding and the new algorithms that have popped up and become publicly available over the last two years: [AlphaFold](projects/coding/AlphaFold.md), [ESMfold](https://esmatlas.com/), Rosettafold, etc. The workshop leader was Amijai Saragovi, a Postdoc in the Baker lab in Seattle. (Here are the [seminar notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12SgqOSQw7aRS5qEVr360O8BdChmJv0Ng)) I've been meaning to look into this stuff a bit more for a while anyway, so it was a good opportunity to be \"forced\" to do that. We were a nice little crowd of about 10 people, working from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, with some of us (including me) going home to sleep, and some actually doing the whole 24h. My team tried to improve the sweetness of the protein brazzein by using a combination of MPNN, Alphafold, EMSfold, Inpainting and Pymol. \n\n## w3 2023\n- Tried to make vegan [tamagoyaki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/tamagoyaki/) with silken tofu, mung bean flour and rice flour. Though I couldn't find mung bean flour in the Indian shop, so I bought the closest I could find - which was urid/urad flour (i.e. black gram lentil flour). The tamagoyaki turned out too fluffy/sticky for a real egg experience, BUT it reminded me of [uttapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam)). So I looked up how to make uttapam, and it is in fact a mix of rice and urid flour (actually, most recipe I found start with soaking the whole kernels and wet grind it later, but [this one here](https://www.ruchiskitchen.com/homemade-instant-uttapam-mix/)uses flour). Uttapam, dosa and idli are actually all with the same or a very similar dough. Incidentally, I tried to make idli yesterday for the first time. That was from a ready-mix package, and - again - didn't turn out exactly as I wanted but good enough for a first try. So now with the large bag of urid flour I have, I really want to try out uttapam. I love uttapam, especially with onion and tomato on top, and some sour chutney for dipping. I've only been able to get it form a single restaurant here in Helsingborg (called The South Indian). \n- Finally managed to get all my self-made clothes from the last 3 (?) years out on the bed, try them on and take pictures of myself. Started to catalogue them [here](projects/sewing/Made%20from%20scratch.md). \n- A good way to scope out which hiking routes offer sufficient accomodation and food opportunities along the way is to download the .gpx file of a route (often from alltrails, e.g. https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/orebro--2/bergslagsleden), then going to https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ and importing that file. Then in different layers and with different colours, things can be added. I made two separate maps so far, one for Bergslagsleden and one for √Öhus-Karlskrona, with all the restaurants, supermarkets and hostels along the way in different colours. \n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230122140136.png)\n- Made vegan [hottokeiki](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/vegan-fluffy-japanese-pancakes/), tasted very good! \n- For nice ambient music, Duncan's [Jamuary](https://duncangeere.bandcamp.com/album/jamuary-2023) on Bandcamp is a good listen. \n- Apparently, De Cecco is a much better pasta brand than Barilla (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XMTvAgpEw). I will test and report back. I do love Barilla's tagliatelle, but maybe there is better stuff out there?\n- The origin of the single-letter code for amino acids: http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/Dayhoff.html\n\n\n## w2 2023\n- https://github.com/jasonwebb/morphogenesis-resources\n- https://brilliant.org/welcome/where-to-start/?tour=true\u0026signup=1\n- Made [Keckek el Fouqara (Poor man's cheese)](projects/fermentation/Keckek%20el%20Fouqara%20(Poor%20man's%20cheese).md), fermented bulgur that apparantly will taste (at some point) like cheese.

I never understand how these two are mutually exclusive, and why people argue about what is more important. **They are both equally important and don't work without the other!** \n\nPersonal action is often regarded as having too little or even no impact. But that argument seems to be a way for people to absolving themselves from responsibility and power. Often grounded in envy, greed and self-defence - _Why should __I__ stop flying when there are billionaires flying to space? Why should __I__ feel bad about eating meat when this guy over there is eating double my portion?_  - things that are (unfortunatley) deeply human. And I can totally understand it, because I'm not immune to these thoughts either. It's not nice to on one hand become aware of your bad impact on the environment, feel like you want to change it, feel guilty about things that you can't or don't want to change, and then see others not care while you try to make an effort. \n\nThe way out of this (at least for me) is to reframe these personal actions as something positive. Not consuming so much has had a very calming effect on life in general (is shopping really fun??). It's cheaper, and not accumulating so many things is quite relieving. Eating vegan and vegetarian has improved my cooking, made me more curious about ingredients and other cuisines, and it's (usually) healthier. Not owning a car is another huge reliever of the stress that road rage, parking problems, traffic jams, accidents, repairs etc. would cause, and saves me quite a lot of money. I LOVE my calm train commute where I can read a book or look out the window.  \n\nAnd as an argument for people still insisting that personal action won't change a thing: Industries have forever figured out that tiny actions have a HUGE impact! The famous example of airlines reducing the number or even the [weight of paper](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-travel-briefcase-united-inflight-magazine-20180120-story.html) of in-flight magazines cuts litterally _millions_ of liters of fuel every year. I work in a big food company - just reducing some heating process by _one degree_ in the factory has an enormous impact on total energy consumption (and costs) as well as some knock-on effects like less wear on heat exchangers (i.e. cost savings), less need for harsh cleaning materials (i.e. positive for the environment), etc. It's so short-sighted to think that none of us individuals has an impact. \n\n----\n\nHere's another article that argues that personal action doesn't have much impact and that people shouldn't be too preachy about it: https://medianism.org/2022/08/15/you-cant-get-no-satisfaction-from-reducing-your-own-personal-carbon-footprint/\n\nI do agree with the premise: \n\u003eBeing self-righteous about your own personal actions against climate change can make other people feel inferior and cause them to reject the entire idea. \n\n\u003eOur most important job as environmentalists is to convince the people who haven't yet been convinced that we should do anything at all.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that working on reducing your own personal footprint is pointless. Sure, it's much more important to work on collective reduction in carbon emissions than to fret about a piece of cheese you ate or a pair of trousers you bought, but who if not WE AS CONSUMERS should stop consuming? Fewer things being needlessly produced, fewer things being shipped around the planet, fewer things ending up in landfills and oceans. \nIt's always presented as such a sacrifice, but I think many people (in rich countries) could live an equally happy, if not happier, life if their focus wasn't so much on accumulating things and spending money on status symbols. \n\nThe more interesting point in this article is:\n\u003e There is an asymmetry between the efforts of climate-change environmentalists versus big carbon. Environmentalists spend a lot of our moral resources to increase our personal moral purity and reduce our individual carbon footprint. On the other side of the political divide, big carbon doesn‚Äôt waste any resources on personal moral purity and so they can devote all their resources to influence the public sphere to stop policies that would actually make a difference.\n\nNot so much the thing about personal moral purity etc. (the article spends far too much space painting environmentalists as these ultra-preachy people who feel superior). But the idea that industries (oil, plastic, sugar, cigarettes, cars, etc.) encourage putting the onus on individual people as a distraction, while spending their time and power on influencing policies and politics.\n\nIt's not a strategy that environmentalists should or could adopt - Big Oil makes a LOT of money and has interest in making even more, on the other hand environmentalists are not driven by profit and can't (and shouldn't) offer the same incentives to (corrupt) politicians as oil lobbyists do. But it's important to identify these strategies and **call companies out** on them. Investigate, reveal, explain, publicize. \n\nOverall, I agree that if you want to have maximum positive effect on the climate, it's much better to **look for actions with the most impact**, participate in organisations and events, be vocal about climate change and be inclusive and not alienating about it, than to _just_ reduce your own personal carbon footprint. \nBut again, how is anything supposed to change if no one is making ANY change? Many drops make an ocean. We need both - personal action and collective action. One doesn't work without the other, it's a chicken and egg problem. \n\n---\n\n## Actions\n- Find impactful and public climate actions (including: donate to and support the actions that have the most impact). \n- Be vocal about participating in (fun) climate actions.\n- Show the upsides of leading a low-carbon life style. It's not a sacrifice: not owning a car is freedom; train travel is fun, cheap and fast; repairing clothes is often more rewarding than buying  new ones; vegan food is delicious and healthy; hobbies don't have to cost money or be based on consumption.\n- Expose industries for their distracting actions as well as their damaging actions (car companies producing ever bigger cars and marketing them as FREEDOM; companies implementing distracting \"skip the straw\" initatives [while collaborating with oil industry](https://logicmag.io/nature/oil-is-the-new-data/), etc.).\n\n---\n## What makes people care\n(from [The Science of What Makes People Care](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_science_of_what_makes_people_care#))\n\u003eResearch from multiple disciplines tells us that people engage and consume information that affirms their identities and aligns with their deeply held values and worldview, and avoid or reject information that challenges or threatens them.\n\nAnd very importantly: \n\u003e People seek information that **makes them feel good about themselves and allows them to be a better version of themselves**. If you start with this understanding of the human mind and behavior, you can design campaigns that help people see where your values intersect and how the issues you are working on matter to them.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221022204336.png)\n\n\n\u003ePeople tend to avoid or remain unmoved by stories and situations that attempt to make them feel bad. They avoid information that makes them feel sad, fearful, or guilty when there isn‚Äôt a way to resolve those feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, very powerful emotions are **awe** (e.g. at the beauty of nature) and **pride** (e.g. about helping the environment). \n\n\nEffective calls to action follow three rules: \n- They are specific\n- The target community sees how the solution will help solve the problem\n- And they are something the community knows how to do.\n\n\n\u003eCalls to action that leave people feeling that they will not make a difference on the issue will likely result in inaction.\n\n\n\u003ePeople fail to act not because they do not have enough information, but because they don‚Äôt care or they don‚Äôt know what to do. If you start with this perspective as the foundation for your work, you can craft a strategy that helps people care and tells them exactly what you want them to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.381433092Z","tags":null},"/climate/Scales-of-Change":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.381433092Z","tags":null},"/climate/Your-money-is-your-carbon":{"title":"Your money is your carbon","content":"\nBy Bill McKibben https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/your-money-is-your-carbon\n\nBanks are driving the climate crisis by supplying easy money to Big Oil.

The LA Times ran a well-intentioned [editorial](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-22/climate-change-concern-marketing) last year about how most Americans don‚Äôt care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A [Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/) in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study [concluding](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32412-y) that most Americans _believe_ that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence.\n\n\u003e All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel.\n\n\u003e We have the solutions we need in [solar and wind](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report); we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual [carbon sequestration](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/01/carbon-capture-is-not-a-solution-to-net-zero-emissions-plans-report-says) and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence.\n\n\u003e A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It‚Äôs been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam [reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/oxfam-report-the-global-wealthy-are-main-drivers-of-climate-change.html) that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly.\n\n\n\u003e Usually if I ask people what they‚Äôre doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they‚Äôre not consuming or doing ‚Äì but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. \n\n**--\u003e We need more people _doing_ something instead of not doing something.

The sun trickles through the dense canopy of tall trees above you. You‚Äôre surrounded by plants and animals - birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking, leaves rustling, insects crawling. But there is another inhabitant in the forest, neither plant nor animal. It permeates the soft and bouncy soil under your feet with long, thin filaments, entangled and growing in all directions, decomposing dead wood into nutrients, nurturing tree roots. Here and there you can see a trace of this inhabitant, in the form of a shiny hat atop a delicate stem, a thick white wedge growing from the side of a tree trunk, or a velvet blanket covering a decaying fruit. Welcome to the world of fungi.\n\n---\n\nFungi are a vital part of our ecosystems, often called the ‚Äúrecyclers of Nature‚Äù. But what exactly are these enigmatic lifeforms? They contribute to our lives in a myriad of ways, synthesizing antibiotics, acids and cholesterol medication, producing food and drinks, growing into furniture, insulation and clothes, cleaning water and decontaminating soil‚Ä¶ Just like they permeate the forest floor, they permeate society, but still many people know very little about them. Most just view the creeping growth of mould as repulsive and disgusting, a sign of spoilage (though if watched closely, [a quite beautiful one](https://vimeo.com/454729694?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-1-fungi)).\n\nIn this newsletter, I want to offer a different perspective. I‚Äôll tell you stories where the fungi are the heroes. Fungi are a true cornerstone of our civilization, they deserve a place in the spotlight. 10 carefully selected topics will highlight the surprising and exciting ways in which fungi and fungal technology have changed, are changing, and will change our world.\n\n![Pleurotus mycelium on coffee grounds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Mycelium_RH_%288%29.jpg)\n\n### So what are fungi?\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúFungi are diverse and often flexible, and they live in many places, ranging from ocean currents to toenails.‚Äù [1]\n\nFungi are neither bacteria, nor plant nor animal. But they share characteristics with all of these kingdoms, stretching conventional classification systems in a lot of ways.\n\nLike bacteria, they can be classed as microorganisms‚Äîand some fungi do exist as microscopic single cells (yeasts). Most, however, exist as multicellular organisms‚Äîassembling into branching structures that cover centimetres or even metres in diameter.\n\nLike plants, fungi can form different tissues and organs, and produce seed-like spores to spread. But unlike trees and flowers and algae, fungi don‚Äôt rely on sunlight to grow, and their cell walls don‚Äôt contain cellulose. Even so, until the middle of the 20th century, fungi were considered to be part of the plant kingdom and it was only after genetic analyses that we were able to determine for certain that they are actually related more closely to animals than to plants.\n\nLike animals, fungi constantly need to find organic material to consume to stay alive. Animals usually do this by digesting food inside their bodies while fungi secrete digestive enzymes outside their bodies, directly onto their food, to break it down and then absorb this soup of nutrients. Animals usually move around, while fungi instead reach and grow in different directions (usually towards a food source).\n\nMost fungi I will write about grow into vast networks (these are called ‚Äúfilamentous fungi‚Äù, or moulds), but I will occasionally mention and even dedicate a whole chapter to fungi that stay as single cells throughout their lives: the yeasts. Similarly, mushrooms will be mentioned at times, but there is a difference between fungi and mushrooms. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of some fungi, but not all fungi form mushrooms.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúA mushroom is not a self-contained organism, like a jellyfish, for example. It is a reproductive organ produced by a colony, or mycelium, which grows in soil or rotting wood. For convenience, we use the term ‚Äòmushroom‚Äô rather than ‚Äòmushroom-forming fungus‚Äô to describe the whole organism, although this is a bit like using a photograph of a large pair of testicles to represent an elephant.‚Äù [2]\n\n![Oyster mushrooms](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/15/18/10/fungi-2069474_1280.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### Growing in networks\n\nThe life of a filamentous fungus starts with a tiny spore, just a few micrometers in size, falling onto humid soil or a juicy fruit lying on the ground. The spore germinates and grows into a network of fine thread-like filaments (hyphae) that spread out and form the mycelium, a network of cells working together for survival, growing through organic matter, soil, wood and decaying leaves. Individual hyphae can only be seen under the microscope, but the mycelium as a whole grows into a large fluffy mass that is visible to the naked eye (like on that orange you forgot in the fruit basket).\n\nNutrients direct this growth, with the filaments acting as fine probing sensors that test the surrounding space and grow in whichever direction the conditions are more favourable. As they grow, the far tips of the filaments secrete enzymes into their environment that break down organic material into simple sugars, which are then taken up by the fungal cells and shared among the whole mycelium network.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIf you could make the soil liquid and transparent and walk into the ground, you would find yourself surrounded by the nets of fungal hyphae.‚Äù [1]\n\n![Mycelium growth simulation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Mycelium_growth_simulation.gif)\n\n---\n\nThat‚Äôs as much fungal biology as you need to know for now, but it is important to set the scene for the three characteristics that are most important for understanding how humans use fungi:\n\n-   the growth into a dense network\n-   the ability to produce enzymes and other substances and release them into their surroundings\n-   and the ability to grow on a wide range of different things, many of which we consider waste.\n\nFungi are found almost everywhere on Earth - in soil, water, air, and on and inside other organisms. Recent estimates suggest that there are up to 3.8 million different species of fungi, of which only 120 000 have been formally recognised, and only 35 000 named [3]. This means 97% of fungi are still waiting to be found, and most of those are in tropical parts of the world where species diversity is higher.\n\nThere are already a dizzying variety of fungi and mushrooms that have proven or supposed medicinal effects, can be eaten or are used for industrial processes. Imagine how many there are yet to be found. So let‚Äôs get to it.\n\n_In the next episode:_ **_Turning starch into protein. Eating mould. The history of Quorn.

Credit: Silvia H√ºttner._\n\nBeer, cheese, bread, soy sauce‚Ä¶ All of the intentional uses of fungi in food production once started as accidental discoveries, with spores delivered by wind, hands, grains and fruits. These discoveries happened centuries, or even millennia, ago. But there is one recent example where the use of a fungus to produce a new food product was actually the result of rational planning and careful screening of suitable strains. This lab-based approach resulted in what was called by its inventor ‚Äúthe first new food since the potato‚Äù.\n\n## Turning starch into protein\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, many scientists as well as UN agencies warned that the world would soon run out of protein. Fears that animal products alone could not feed Earth‚Äôs growing population, and would cause famines and malnourishment, spurred research into alternative sources. It wasn‚Äôt long before food scientists started to turn to microorganisms for nutrition. Fungi and bacteria have the advantage of growing very efficiently under simple conditions. Most of them need just sugar, nitrogen, phosphorus and some minerals to grow and grow and grow and grow, doubling in number in as little as half an hour. Inside their cells they turn the nutrients they‚Äôve taken up into edible protein, much more efficiently than any cow or chicken could ever do. This seemed like a perfect way to produce protein at a large scale.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3osxYeymtCD76SeQjC/giphy.gif)\n\n_Animation of bacteria growing and dividing. Credit: Giphy_\n\nAs a large cereal producer, British food conglomerate Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) had a lot of starch left over and started looking into ways to turn this abundant carbohydrate-rich byproduct into more sought-after protein. They collected over 3000 samples of filamentous fungi from all over the world to identify a strain that was safe to eat, would have a pleasant flavour and texture, and grew well on starch or sugar under laboratory and industrial conditions. The almost-too-good-to-be true story is, that despite combing the entire planet, the researchers eventually struck gold in 1967 in a field just a stone‚Äôs throw away from the RHM Technology Research Centre in Buckinghamshire, UK. The soil fungus they found, _Fusarium venenatum_, subsequently became the now hundred-million-dollar brand Quorn.\n\nTurning a soil fungus into a new food product took Quorn many years of research, feeding trials in 12 animal species, and food safety assessments that included a two million word report on toxicology to get approval from the authorities. It also took time and money to develop and optimise the necessary large-scale production equipment to grow the fungus and turn it into food. But in 1985, this work was finally complete and Quorn launched on British supermarket shelves bearing the name ‚Äúmycoprotein‚Äù (from myco = Greek for fungus) in the form of mince, ‚Äúchicken‚Äù filets, sausages, and more. In the 35 years since, Quorn has gradually expanded into other countries. Occasionally, the brand faced some resistance on introduction, such as in the US where they were accused of [mislabelling](https://www.wired.com/2002/04/a-mushrooming-quorn-controversy/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) the products as ‚Äúmushroom-based‚Äù (they now mention ‚Äúmould‚Äù on their labels, as well as possible cross-reactions from people allergic to mould). Today Quorn is available in 14 countries worldwide.\n\n![](https://images.ctfassets.net/uexfe9h31g3m/38d4Fi2mtGKqsIA28YKGow/a136af0e6910ef10caf82a7d2d931096/Quorn_Thai_Sticky_Fillets.jpg?w=1024\u0026h=576\u0026fm=webp\u0026fit=thumb\u0026q=90)  \n_‚ÄúChicken‚Äù filet from Quorn UK‚Äôs recipe website. Credit: Quorn_\n\n---\n\n## How is mycoprotein made?\n\nMycoprotein, like Quorn, is made in large, up to 40-metre tall, stainless steel tanks (called bioreactors) that keep a mixture of sugar, water and some minerals at a certain temperature. Air is bubbled through the liquid, mixing it and saturating it with oxygen. Into this nutrient jacuzzi, a small volume of fungi starter culture is added, in a sterile way to make sure that nothing else but the specific fungal strain grows inside the tank. The fungal cells, surrounded by the most ideal conditions they could hope for, happily start to grow and divide, soon forming thick, fluffy clumps of mycelium that have a consistency somewhere between applesauce and wet cotton. If no more nutrients are added, the mycelium grows until all available sugar in the liquid is consumed and the whole process is completed in less than 24h.\n\nThe mycelium, aka the mycoprotein, can then be harvested by separating it from the liquid. The doughy mass of beige mycoprotein coming out of the bioreactor is surprisingly meat-like, since the fine, intertwined filaments of the mycelium resemble muscle fibres and give the product a chewy texture. Mycoprotein is high in protein and fibre content, and very low in fat and sugar. And what does it taste like? If you expect an aromatic mushroom-like taste you might be disappointed to learn that it doesn‚Äôt really taste of anything much. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre a food company looking for an easy meat replacement, you‚Äôre probably thrilled by this fact.\n\nQuorn runs a continuous process, where grown mycelium is removed from the tank and fresh sugar-water is added at all times, keeping a steady stream of nutrients and space for new mycelium to grow [1]. In this way, a single process can run for up to six weeks churning out hundreds of kilos of mycoprotein per hour. Compare that to the time it takes for a cow to grow from conception to slaughterhouse, and it‚Äôs clear to see why mycoprotein production is such an incredibly efficient way to produce protein.\n\n_Side note: This way of growing microorganisms is either referred to as cultivation or fermentation. In a biochemistry-strict sense, fermentation only happens in the absence of oxygen, though the term has become somewhat looser in food production._\n\n---\n\n## Finnish mycoprotein\n\nAround the same time that Quorn was created in the UK, and prompted by the same motivations to increase worldwide protein production, a similar process was developed further North, with a very different outcome.\n\nFinland‚Äôs forest cover is more extensive than that of any other European country, about 76% of the land is covered with trees. Naturally, pulp and paper production has been a very important industry for centuries, and the pulp mills dotting the landscape churn out not only paper but also large amounts of waste streams containing water, acids, other chemicals, and cellulose. As you can witness in a forest, many fungi can grow on wood and consume the sugars in the wood cellulose as food. Therefore, researchers in the 1960s looked into the possibility of using the cellulose-containing waste streams in paper mills as a nutrient source for growing fungi. Hundreds of strains were tested and one was identified as suitable to grow on these waste streams and produce high amounts of protein-rich mycelium.\n\nThe process was named Pekilo process, after the fungus they used, _Paecilomyces variotii_, and industrial production at two sites in Finland was established. Thousands of tonnes of mycoprotein were produced to be used initially as pig and chicken feed. Researchers also looked into using Pekilo as an ingredient in sausages, meatballs [2] and bread [3]. However, after only a decade, production of Pekilo protein was stopped and it never made it onto supermarket shelves. Why? New developments in the paper pulping process had led to changes in the waste stream composition, and at the same time interest in Pekilo protein decreased. The last Pekilo plant in M√§ntt√§ closed in 1992.\n\n---\n\n## Quorn‚Äôs competitors\n\nBy the 1980s, fears of the ‚ÄúWorld Protein Gap‚Äù had faded and been [debunked](https://theconversation.com/the-protein-gap-nutritional-sciences-biggest-error-76202?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds). In the 90s, Pekilo research was put into a filing cupboard, and Quorn - though successful - remained a niche product for vegetarians for most of the late 20th and early 21st century. All the while humanity continued to [increase its taste for animal protein](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) and found ever more ways to erode ecosystems and animal welfare through factory farming and feed plantations.\n\nIn recent years, however, due to greater awareness of the negative impact of meat production on the environment and meat consumption on personal health, sales of plant-based alternatives have grown enormously. Virtually every large food producer has soy, pea or gluten protein products on the market today. But when it comes to mycoprotein, Quorn is still the only option on supermarket shelves.\n\nThere are several possible reasons why other companies are still hesitant to make food from mycelium. The first is lack of expertise, as fungi cultivation and mycoprotein production require a very specific set of skills not traditionally found in the food industry. Another is concern that the association with mould could be a turn-off for consumers. There can also be considerable regulatory hurdles when it comes to using new ingredients in food - remember, it took Quorn a long time and a lot of money to get their mycoprotein approved. Finally, there‚Äôs the simple calculation that investing in very expensive and specialised equipment may just not be worth it when new alternative-meat products created with known ingredients (soy etc.) are performing so well.\n\nThings are beginning to change, however. The need for greener food production is more pressing than ever, consumers are starting to crave new products (and are often willing to pay a higher price for them), and the boom in microbreweries has shown that it‚Äôs feasible to start successful fermentation businesses even if you‚Äôre not a multinational corporation. Not unimportantly as well, many of Quorn‚Äôs initial patents recently expired, making it possible to ‚Äúcopy‚Äù their process, and you can even order the Quorn strain [from a culture collection](https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/products/all/20334?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds).\n\nSeveral small companies have popped up in the last couple of years that promise an updated, 21st-century version of how mycoprotein can help feed (and save) the world. They mostly focus on the prospective immense savings of water, land area, time and greenhouse gas emissions that can be achieved when comparing the production of a kilo of mycoprotein to a kilo of meat, as well as the advantages of mycoprotein over plant-based alternatives. Mycoprotein has a better [nutritional profile](https://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Fulltext/2019/01000/Mycoprotein__Nutritional_and_Health_Properties.4.aspx?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) than many plant proteins, offers a better (meaning in this case more meat-like) texture and can be grown faster on less land than most plants.\n\nTo differentiate themselves from Quorn, these companies innovate on different aspects of the production process. Some have developed new ways of growing fungi and cultivate the mycelium not submerged in liquid but instead in [thick](https://www.atlastfood.co/method?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) [fluffy](https://www.naturesfynd.com/fy-protein?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) layers, that already resemble a meat-like structure.

Tanks for mycoprotein production can be made in any size, and with some clever engineering, personal myco-fermenters could soon be a [normal appliance](https://www.kernel.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) in our homes. Or, if not in our homes, then a decentralised food production system could be envisioned, where villages or communities might manufacture their own mycoprotein. Similarly, mycoprotein production could happen at many different sites in connection with other industries that produce suitable side-streams which are then directly fed into the fungi cultivation tanks, as pioneered by the Pekilo process.\n\nSince the fungal growth process happens in a controlled, sealed-off environment, this type of food production is largely independent of weather, climate or soil conditions and can therefore happen in places where normal agriculture is impossible (and increasingly more impossible due to climate change). Of course, the need for clean water and electricity for the fermentation present a challenge, but one that will hopefully be solved in the near future by improved production processes (e.g. water recycling) and [better availability of solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) and wind power. Currently, the carbon footprint of mycoprotein is still slightly worse than that of plant proteins or even chicken [4], mostly because of the high electricity demand of heating, cooling, stirring and aerating the bioreactors. And while chicken farming is certainly not great for chickens, its greenhouse gas emissions are actually relatively low compared to other meats (such as beef). But mycoprotein production is already a clear winner in some aspects, such as water pollution (no manure runoff into waterways!) or land use.\n\nWhat about lab-grown meat? In the last few years it has attracted a lot of attention and investment and has, like mycoprotein, been touted as a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù for more sustainable food production. Unfortunately, the animal cells that are used for lab-grown meat are more delicate and fussy than fungi cells, grow slower and require more complicated bioreactor setups and conditions (e.g. scaffolds, vitamins, growth factors). Lab-grown meat has still not been produced at large scale, while mycoprotein is actually a comparatively [mature technology](http://fafdl.org/blog/2019/08/01/why-cultured-meat-will-not-feed-the-world-but-mycoprotein-just-might/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds). At the time of writing, it‚Äôs [questionable](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03448-1?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) if lab-grown meat will ever live up to its promises of being a more sustainable meat alternative [5].\n\nEither way, for some people, growing our food in temperature-controlled tanks might be a step too futuristic or ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù. But if it means drastically reducing the environmental impact, not slaughtering billions of animals on a daily basis and being able to produce tasty and nutritious food in a reliable manner, it‚Äôs perhaps worth revisiting those reservations.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode: **Fungi as materials.

Also called tinder mushroom, it was also a popular flammable substance and even [√ñtzi the Iceman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) had some of it in his pockets when he was crossing the Alps.\n\nAmadou was for a long time the only fungi-based material in common use, but this is about to change. In the last ten years, materials made with or from fungi have started to pop up in design and art magazines, as chairs, lampshades or wallets or even as whole buildings. So far mostly used as concept pieces or promotional material from design studies, fungi products might finally go mainstream in 2021. The New York Times [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) about fungi being _‚Äúfall‚Äôs hottest fashion trend‚Äù_ and Adidas very recently [announced](https://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2020/adidas-2021-first-time-more-60-percent-all-products-will-be-made/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) the development of ‚Äúa new material, a purely biological leather alternative made from mycelium‚Äù that they will use ‚Äúfor the very first time in the creation of footwear‚Äù. It‚Äôs not that often that people get excited about fungi on their feet.\n\nSo let‚Äôs look into what kind of fungi materials there are, how to make them, and why they‚Äôre exciting. We‚Äôll start with leather.\n\n## Mycelium leather\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúThere are traditionally two ways to make a leather jacket. One involves a cow, and takes years. Another involves synthetic fabric, and requires plastic. But there‚Äôs a third option: thick sheets of woven fungus, grown over a couple of weeks on anything from sawdust to agricultural waste.‚Äù ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/science/fungus-leather.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nRemember how mycoprotein is made in big vats for food, as described in [Episode 2](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)? You can make fungal leather in much the same way - where the fibrous mycelium pulp is pressed into sheets like paper pulp in traditional paper-making.\n\nMore commonly though, fungal leather is obtained by solid state fermentation, meaning that the mycelium grows in mats on a bed of nutritious solid particles, often agricultural waste, such as straw or sawdust. This is less energy-intensive than liquid cultivation, and also allows the mycelium to grow in its naturally self-assembling, three-dimensional structure, which is important for the texture and durability of the resulting material.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0YiVsb.jpg) _Pressed and dried mycelium mats (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\nSome species are more suitable than others [1]. The fungi used for this process are usually of the mushroom-forming variety (basidiomycetes), therefore the growth conditions have to be adjusted carefully to suppress mushroom formation and get only the desired dense mats of mycelium. Indonesia-based Mycotech - who launched [fungi sneakers and wallets](https://www.store.mycl.bio/product-page/bro-do-x-mylea-better-shoes?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in 2019 - experimented first with the common oyster mushroom, before [switching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykWIACD6u8E\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) to Ganoderma (also called Lingzhi or Reishi) because it gave better results. Generally, [polypores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) - which you can often find on the side of tree trunks - are used for creating fungi materials, because they grow in a denser structure than other fungal species.\n\nAfter 5-10 days of growth, the mat of interwoven mycelium is harvested, pressed and dried to obtain a material that is already surprisingly leather-like. It doesn‚Äôt need a full-on tanning process like animal leather, though some chemical treatment is necessary to make it more resilient and improve its properties. Soaking in glycerol increases elasticity and strength [2] and immersing in acid or alcohol removes undesired soluble components and results in crosslinking, which gives the material additional strength and durability. Bleaching or treatment to eliminate odour might also be necessary. After that, the fungal material is pressed and dried, and dyed or imprinted if desired. The result is a material with a nice organic texture, velvety and soft to the touch, a bit like stroking a dry camembert.\n\nDespite not being a completely chemical-free process, production of fungal leather has a much lower environmental impact than animal leather or conventional synthetic leather, which is [made from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_leather?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#Environmental_impact) petroleum-based PVC. A big advantage is also that the mycelium mats can be grown to sizes of several square metres and to many desired shapes or thicknesses.\n\nBeing a biological growth process, no direct energy input is needed (if grown in solid state fermentation and at ambient temperature). And since the species of fungi used are wood degraders, the growth substrates are typically waste or by-products from forestry and agriculture, or even paper and cardboard, which makes the production process in essence an upcycling process.\n\nConsiderable energy input is however necessary not only for the steps after growth (such as pressing and drying), but also for sterilising the raw materials _before_ the fungi can grow on them. This is usually done with heat and steam, but there are less energy-intensive alternatives such as submerging the raw material in peroxide solution for an hour, or in cold water for a few days.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly for a new technology, cost estimates show that mycelium leather is cheaper to produce than comparable animal or synthetic leather varieties [3], since the raw materials cost next to nothing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e1INe92.jpeg) _Mycelium leather samples (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\nSo what are the difficulties in making fungi leather? In an environment where the raw material is literally agricultural waste teeming with thousands of organisms, contamination is one of the biggest issues manufacturers are facing. Even with rigorous sterilisation and cleaning procedures, it‚Äôs tricky to avoid other microbes growing alongside the desired fungus, possibly resulting in a damaged product or no product at all.\n\nAnother issue is inconsistency. Biological processes can be finicky, and fungal growth is no exception. Changes in temperature, humidity, substrate composition, time of day, light, CO2 concentration, etc. lead to variations in growth, resulting in products with inconsistent thickness, texture, colour or structure. And customers tend to like consistency.\n\nFungal leather hasn‚Äôt been on the market very long yet, so longer-term durability is still unknown. And one of the biggest selling points of fungal leather is also up for discussion: its biodegradability. While pure mycelium can be completely biologically degraded within weeks, polymer composites or coated mycelium materials might not be (and take as long to decompose as the least-biodegradable component in the mix). If fungal leather is mixed too much with other materials, we might end up with the same problem that coated paper and bioplastics face, which is that they are hard or impossible to recycle properly once they reach the end of their life or use.\n\nMycowork‚Äôs Reishi (which was presented at [NY fashion week](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/reishi-launch-at-new-york-fashion-week?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in February 2020), for example, incorporates polyester as reinforcement and has a polylactic acid coating, which gives it [higher tear strength and higher flexibility](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/performance-results-q120?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) than even animal leather, but also makes the material hardly biodegradable.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn theory, we can grow Reishi in any shape, whether that‚Äôs something very large and seamless, or smaller custom shapes that eliminate all the waste associated with cutting a hide. With leather, you‚Äôre essentially cutting arbitrary patterns into a cow-shaped hide and so a lot of our brand partners are excited by the fact that Reishi can be grown in any shape‚Äìboth for the design possibilities that creates and the reduction of waste.‚Äù (Matt Scullin, Mycoworks CEO, [Source](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/what-a-fashion-insider-wants-to-know-about-reishi?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nMycoworks was founded in 2013 by Sophia Wang and Philip Ross, an artist that has been working with mycelium since the 1990s. The other prominent player in the field is Ecovative, a mycelium materials pioneer that was founded in New York in 2007. Ecovative partnered with Bolt Threads - a biomaterials company also making artificial spider silk by yeast fermentation - to bring the product Mylo to the market (though [not without legal problems](https://dailygazette.com/2019/03/31/green-island-mushroom-tech-firm-exchanges-legal-salvos-with-california-partner/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) along the way). Mylo [debuted](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boltprojects/the-mylo-driver-bag?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in April 2018, and partnerships with Adidas, Lululemon and Stella McCartney promise fungi-based garments in stores in [2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials).\n\nThere are still only a handful of companies developing fungi leather, and most of them have very similar ideas about naming their product: Mylo (Bolt Threads), Mylea (Mycotech), Mylium ([Mylium](https://www.mylium.nl/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)), [MycoFlex](https://ecovativedesign.com/mycoflex?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) (Ecovative), [Pura Flex](http://pura.mogu.bio/project/pural-materials/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) (MOGU), and Reishi (Mycoworks).\n\nGetting your hands on some fungi lederhosen will still take some time though, as most of these companies don‚Äôt yet have large scale production. Instead they‚Äôre looking for funding (some [through](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boltprojects/the-mylo-driver-bag?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mycotech/the-worlds-first-mushroom-wooden-watch?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)) or have entered exploratory collaborations with designers (as mentioned above).\n\nBut things could change quickly, especially if existing mushroom farms are adapted to become the leather producers of the near future. Already Mylo [is being grown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in European warehouses that used to produce mushrooms for the gourmet market.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VvinLLO.jpg) _Fungal mycelium growing in stacked trays (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\n---\n\n## Mycelium blocks\n\nLeather is the most fashionable, but certainly not the only material that can be made out of mycelium. Fill some sawdust into a container, add the right kind of fungi spores, wait a few days, and you get a compact block of a natural mycelium composite that is dense, light and surprisingly strong. The mycelium acts like a glue binding the particles together (while also partially digesting them). After baking and killing the living fungi, the material is dry and durable.\n\n![](https://indiebio.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mushroom_brick_mycoworks.jpg) _Mycelium bricks stacked on top of each other (Credit: Mycoworks)_\n\nIf ‚Äúblocks of light, dense material‚Äù remind you of polystyrene, you‚Äôre not alone. Several companies have explored the possibilities of making fungi-based packaging to cushion expensive wine bottles or computer parts. Ecovative (with the brand [Mushroom Packaging](https://mushroompackaging.com?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)) licenses its technology of how to grow mycelium in moulds to get the exact right shape and size to snugly hold a product in place. Companies in [New Zealand](https://www.biofab.co.nz/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), the [Netherlands](https://www.grown.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), the [USA](https://www.paradisepackaging.co/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and the [UK](https://www.magicalmushroom.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) use Ecovative‚Äôs technology to offer custom-made packaging solutions, including one made of hemp and mycelium that Lush uses to [ship soap](https://www.magicalmushroom.com/casestudies/lush?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials).\n\nHowever, packaging is literally made to be thrown away once you‚Äôve removed the actual product, and so it needs to be a very low-cost product. It‚Äôs hard to imagine mycelium foam to be more than a gimmick for high-priced products, since there is already a cheap, widely used, environmentally-friendly solution widely available: paper and cardboard.\n\nOn the other hand, however, fungi-based packaging can be directly made at the farms that produce the primary raw materials, and could offer a more local and low-emission packaging solution that doesn‚Äôt require cutting down trees [4]. If that‚Äôs enough to compete with existing materials, or if fungi packaging will remain an ultra-niche product, remains to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, fungi‚Äôs unique ability to fill and grow into any shape can be used to make more than just throw-away packaging. Italian-based MOGU uses agricultural residues to develop fungi [floor tiles](https://mogu.bio/flooring/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and [acoustic panels](https://mogu.bio/acoustic/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), while Ecovative has made [lampshades](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/lamp-made-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and other interior products from mycelium, and has (together with Ford) explored the use of fungi foams in car doors and car seats. Conveniently, mycelium composites have been found to absorb noise very well, especially the range of car noise (1,000 Hz) and are more fire-resistant and release less smoke than plastic alternatives [5].\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iv54NkeBYrrpMy4eB6aCor8JAGw=/0x0:5616x3744/1820x1213/filters:focal(2359x1423:3257x2321):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55655605/GrowLamp_HangingPendants5.0.jpg) _Lampshades made out of mycelium (Credit: Ecovative)_\n\nFungi can even be used to construct buildings. The construction sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and materials that can be regenerated offer a path to reduce those emissions. Dr. Jan Wurm, director of the international architecture and construction firm Arup, [says](https://mashable.com/video/mycelium-construction-biofabrication-mogu-arup/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) that ‚Äúwe need to use materials that are grown, that are biofabricated‚Äù.\n\nFungi to the rescue! Mycelium blocks can be used as cheap and fire-resistant construction and insulation material. Not only are [these materials](https://criticalconcrete.com/building-with-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) biodegradable, but they can also trap more heat than fiberglass insulation, are fireproof, nontoxic, and stronger than concrete relative to its weight [6].\n\nThere are some downsides, of course. Low water resistance can be a problem in construction use, making the material vulnerable to humidity and - ironically - mould. Mycelium material in stable conditions has a lifespan of decades, but when in contact with wet ground it can [start decomposing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q5i9poYc3w\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in a matter of weeks. In that sense, mycelium behaves like untreated softwood. Like wood, the mycelium bricks can be treated with coatings that make them more resilient but might compromise the 100% biodegradability factor. It‚Äôs a thorny problem to solve.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúThe future of materials is going to be grown ‚Äì biofabricated ‚Äì and mycelium and its extraordinary ability to assemble itself into complex structures is what will enable us to take biofabrication to the next level of performance.‚Äù (Eben Bayer, Ecovative CEO, [Source](https://synbiobeta.com/ecovative-announces-mycoflex-tm-the-next-generation-mycelium-biofabrication-platform/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nNonetheless, there are already buildings in the world made of fungi. The first large-scale structure made from mycelium bricks was the MoMA PS1 Young Architect‚Äôs Program‚Äôs [winning entry ‚ÄúHy-Fi‚Äù](https://www.archdaily.com/477912/behind-hy-fi-the-entirely-organic-compostable-tower-that-won-moma-ps1-young-architect-s-program-2014?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in 2014 which was built with material from Ecovative.

(More about that in an upcoming episode!)\n\n---\n\n## Special materials\n\nSome more niche applications of fungal material are found in mortuaries. Many fungi are saprobes - or ‚Äúeaters of the dead‚Äù. Artist Jae Rhim Lee took this literally and designed a [burial suit](https://www.ted.com/talks/jae_rhim_lee_my_mushroom_burial_suit?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#t-145875) that is infused with mushroom spores and mycelium, which can speed up decomposition and help break down the [over 200 toxic chemicals](https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/pdf/FourthReport_UpdatedTables_Feb2015.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) that are found in a human body.

The cells used in tissue engineering and lab-grown meat production need a scaffold to grow on. This can be [provided](https://www.excell.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) by the intricate network of mycelium, which is both compatible with cell growth and [edible](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/61cfd1ef-0247-420b-8357-2e7df4405d2c?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials). Additionally, sheets made from mycelium have been shown to improve wound healing [7] and could find applications in medicine.\n\nAs early as in the 1950s, [patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2811442A/en?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) have been granted for including fungi in the papermaking process to improve fire resistance of paper. Newer studies describe nanopaper containing mycelium compounds with uses as specialised membranes, filters and packaging [8].\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt stop there. Other applications for mycelium materials include [sound absorbers](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-fungus-absorber.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and [ear plugs](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/you-could-soon-be-wearing-earplugs-made-of-fungus?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), biodegradable floating wetland panels for habitat creation and shoreline protection [9], and rigid mycelium films that can become a replacement for the widely-used plastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [2].\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/558ff614e4b0344a8c4a8f8c/1559319978759-ELDJNT8TI334A7FULJME/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHtg_DnDrK_LBDO9Fa4RYlwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcLthF_aOEGVRewCT7qiippn-XpjDz03HNDv6M8zfeJJLnmbprUkN7GH1n-ZhSY7_i/6c7552cc-3fea-4c19-81bb-f53317fda7b2.jpeg?format=2500w) _Acoustic wall panels from MOGU (Credit: [Luca Alessandrini](http://lucaalessandrini.com/mogu?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))_\n\nIn short, there‚Äôs still a lot of room for innovation and research when it comes to growing the products of tomorrow. The input influences the outcome; fungi cultivated on one substrate (such as wheat straw) look and feel different than fungi grown on another substrate (such as sawdust). Even sawdust from different kinds of trees can give varying results.\n\nDifferent fungal species can also have vastly different characteristics when it comes to mechanical properties, looks and material behaviour [9]. Getting consistent products at large-scale will be the biggest challenge for mycelium material producers.\n\nThe technology to manufacture fungal materials, especially at a large scale, is still in development. Ecovative first grew mycelium in open trays, but later invented a system where growth takes place in a solid-state bioreactor which supplies air at the right humidity and temperature to the fungi. Currently though, mycelium cultivation is still done mostly manually, without much automation [6]. And, ironically, a lot of plastic is used to make the fungal material, since mycelium bricks are often grown in single-use plastic bags and moulds.\n\nFinding the right customers is another challenge. A lot of the applications of fungal material are in low-price segments, such as packaging or insulation. That‚Äôs why at least initially most companies in the area target art galleries, design studios or organisations that want a few expensive statement pieces. To make fungi-based materials affordable for the mass market, economies of scale are needed.\n\nHaving said that, we will certainly also see more fungi furniture, design products and clothes in the future, made by small studios and artisans. The manufacturing process of, for example, mycelium leather is much more accessible than traditional leather making. Growing products our of fungi could become a new craft where artists, small businesses but also commercial mushroom cultivators experiment and develop new ways of using mycelium.\n\n------\n\n_Thanks to Antoni Gandia, R\u0026D Specialist at MOGU and former Research Scientist at Ecovative, for interesting conversations that helped me dig into this rapidly-expanding field._\n\n---\n\n[1] Fungi as source for bio-based materials: A patent review.

It‚Äôs been a while. üòä I started a new job and that took a bit of my time and headspace. In my new job I work a lot with enzymes, which are made by microorganisms, often fungi. So that‚Äôs an excellent reason to use this episode of Filaments to dive into the MASSIVE - but to many people unknown - business of enzyme production in filamentous fungi. (If you need a refresher about filamentous fungi (moulds) and their use as food and materials, go [here](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)). Also, this is a fairly long episode, so make yourself a cup of tea, and enjoy. üçµ\n\n---\n\n## EPISODE 4 - Fungal products everywhere, part 1\n\nInspect a package of washing powder and you will likely see some or all of the following ingredients: _Subtilisin, cellulases, mannanases, pectinases, proteases, lipases, amylases._ These are all enzymes - proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions. Enzymes are precision tools that usually do one job, and one job only, and that job is often to chop up longer molecules into smaller ones.\n\nCellulase cuts cellulose - a polymer consisting of long chains of sugar molecules - into smaller pieces. Protease breaks down proteins, lactase cuts the milk sugar lactose into glucose and galactose, and so forth. A lot of the enzymes in detergents break down things that come from food and dirt that might be on our clothes, such as greasy sauces (lipases), fruit juice (pectinases), cake batter and mashed potatoes (amylases) or body fluids (proteases). By enzymatically cutting these substances into smaller components, they are more soluble and more easily removed.\n\n![https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/enzym01.gif](https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/enzym01.gif)\n\n_This is (kind of) how an enzyme works (if it was a person). Credit: [Christian Winter](https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/Enzyme.htm?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)_\n\nAlthough enzymes are made by all organisms, including animals and plants, most of those contained in our everyday products and used in industry are produced by microorganisms, i.e. fungi and bacteria (and we obviously focus on fungi here).\n\nFungal enzymes are used in a **_vast_** number of different industries: in agriculture, research and wastewater treatment, in the production of animal feed, pharmaceuticals, alcohol, fuel, juices, beer, bread, dairy products, cleaning products, textiles, leather, sugar, meat and paper, and a lot more. They permeate everyday life to an extent that few people realise.\n\nThe filamentous fungi used for enzyme production are grown in much the same way that filamentous fungi for food production are grown (as described in [Episode 2](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)).\n\n---\n\nWalk into the production site of a large-scale enzyme producer such as DSM, Novozymes, BASF or Amano, and you will see huge, several storey-high stainless steel tanks, holding up to 300 000 L of liquid. These fermentation tanks (or bioreactors) are filled with a particular species of fungus that produces the desired enzyme, and a nutrient solution containing mostly sugar or other low-cost carbohydrate source - often from grains - and some salts. The tanks are set to the perfect temperature and pH for the fungus to grow in, big stirrers mix the liquid and make sure everything is well distributed, and air is bubbled through the liquid from the bottom and the sides of the tank to provide necessary oxygen to the fungus.\n\nFungal growth and enzyme production doesn‚Äôt _start_ in these enormous tanks, though - it happens in steps. First, fungal cells that are stored at -80C are revived in a petri dish where they grow in a beautiful mould pattern. (_Technically, step 0 would be finding and isolating the fungal strain in nature; we‚Äôll come to that in a future episode_).\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aspergillus_niger_2.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aspergillus_niger_2.jpg) _Step 1 in fungal enzyme production: an Aspergillus niger colony that has been growing in a petri dish (on potato dextrose agar) for 3 days. Source: Wikimedia_\n\nThe freshly grown fungal cells from the petri dish are then transferred to a small bioreactor (several litres) and after a day or so the fungal mycelium has grown into a thick filamentous network of billions of interconnected cells, and is ready to be transferred to a larger tank (several hundred litres). There it grows for another day, continuously increasing in mass, until the mycelium is finally transferred to the big main tank where the cells continue to multiply and multiply over several days. The reason for this stepwise process is that the requirements for healthy growth as well as the risk of contamination by other microorganisms can be much better controlled this way.\n\nDuring this multiplication and growth process, the enzymes (the actual products here), are produced by the fungal cells in the tank and continuously secreted into the liquid. The more fungal cells there are, the more enzymes are made and released into the liquid, until the billions of fungal cells in the tank are surrounded by a soup of trillions of nanometre-sized enzymes. All this takes just a few days, and in those few days the slurry of enzymes and fungal mycelium gets thicker and thicker.\n\n![https://www.brain-biotech.com/content/images/News/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Feed-Tanks.jpg](https://www.brain-biotech.com/content/images/News/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Feed-Tanks.jpg) _Step 4 in fungal enzyme production: the main fermentation tanks can hold up to several hundred thousand liters. Source: [BRAIN Biotech](https://www.brain-biotech.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)._\n\nAll that‚Äôs left to do then is to separate the enzymes from everything else in the tank. But first, let‚Äôs talk about where the **fungi** - the stars of the process - actually come from.\n\n---\n\nIn the wild, many fungi have evolved to secrete digestive enzymes which break down plant matter into nutrients that the fungus can take up easily. Usually fungi secrete a whole cocktail of different enzymes, each with a very specific function. In an industrial process, however, we usually only want to produce _one_ kind of enzyme. So how do we do that?\n\nWell, it turns out that the nutrient source, pH, aeration, and salt and mineral additions and concentrations, etc. all influence what kinds of enzymes a fungus produces. Modern fermentation technology is a highly controlled process and has become so optimised that - if everything runs smoothly - the fungus will produce little else than one particular target enzyme.\n\nAnd of course the type of fungus plays a huge role as well. The workhorses of enzyme production haven‚Äôt actually changed much over the last century, and are _Aspergillus niger_, _Aspergillus oryzae_ and _Trichoderma reesei_.\n\n_[A.niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)_ is the fungus that causes black mould on fruits and vegetables (niger means black in Latin) and is used in a wide range of industrial processes, mostly in enzyme and acid production. _A. niger_ makes different amylases - enzymes that break down starch - which are used for example in beer brewing (to improve the malting) and baking (to make fluffier bread). _A. niger_ also makes glucose oxidase, an enzyme found in biosensors such as blood glucose test kits for diabetes and other clinical applications.\n\nThe other Aspergillus, _A. oryzae_, is also called koji in Japanese and has been used for centuries in Southern and Eastern Asia to make fermented rice, barley and soy products like sake, soy sauce and miso. It‚Äôs still used for these purposes, as well as in many other areas, because of its natural capacity to secrete large amounts of different starch- and protein-degrading enzymes.\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Aspergillus_oryzae_%28%E9%BA%B9%29.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Aspergillus_oryzae_%28%E9%BA%B9%29.jpg) _Aspergillus oryzae growing on rice for the production of miso. Source. Wikimedia._\n\nFinally, _T. reesei_ is mostly used in biofuel production, since it produces enzymes that break down cellulose and other plant polymers to sugar that can then be converted to ethanol in a yeast fermentation process. The original _T. reesei_ strain was [isolated](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5134823?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) during WW2 as the cause for rotting (i.e. ‚Äúeating‚Äù) the tents and clothes of US Army soldiers stationed on the Solomon Islands. Today its enzymes are, besides biofuel production, also used to give [stone-washed jeans](https://www.worldofchemicals.com/527/chemistry-articles/why-cellulase-important-in-stone-washing.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) their distressed look and they‚Äôre added to washing powder to remove loose fibres that can cause [textile pilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(textile)?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1).\n\n---\n\nTo achieve an even higher purity or higher concentration of _one particular_ kind of enzyme in production processes, most enzyme companies also use genetically engineered fungal strains (as opposed to so-called ‚Äúwild-type‚Äù or ‚Äúclassical‚Äù strains). Again, Aspergillus is a popular choice, because it grows well, is safe to use and there is more than a hundred years of scientific literature available about it. The gene for a specific enzyme can be inserted several times into the host genome, thereby drastically increasing the production of enzyme per cell. In addition, the enzymes themselves can also be further optimised through biotechnological tools. By carefully adjusting the protein sequence of an enzyme it can for example become more resistant to high temperatures.\n\nGenes from other organisms can also be inserted into the Aspergillus genome, which makes it possible to produce enzymes that this fungus originally wouldn‚Äôt be able to make. Let‚Äôs take an example. [Rennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) (or more specifically the protease enzyme chymosin) is a crucial component of cheese production, and was originally extracted from the stomachs of slaughtered calves. This quite wasteful and cruel practice became obsolete when scientists managed to insert the gene coding for the rennet enzyme into the genome of a fungus. So nowadays, [more than 90%](https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(17)31054-8/fulltext?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) of cheese produced worldwide uses [chymosin](https://www.chr-hansen.com/en/food-cultures-and-enzymes/cheese/cards/product-cards/chy-max-products?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) made by a genetically-engineered organism, often a strain of _Aspergillus niger_. Compared to the traditional way of rennet production, this reduces cruelty, cost, carbon emissions and pollution in the process.\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Cheese.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Cheese.jpg) _Cheese, likely made using fermentation-produced chymosin. Source: Wikimedia._\n\nMost enzyme companies on the market offer both ‚Äúclassical‚Äù enzymes, for users that prefer non-GMO-derived ingredients, as well as enzymes that have been engineered and/or have been produced in GMOs. Just to clarify, however: while ‚Äúclassical‚Äù enzymes don‚Äôt come from fungal strains that have been changed with _modern_ biotech methods, i.e. genetic engineering, they still have been optimised over the years by ‚Äúclassical‚Äù methods. Usually numerous rounds of random mutation (for example by exposing the fungi to gamma-radiation or DNA-altering chemicals) and selection of the best-performing strains, until desirable traits are achieved (similar to plant breeding). Their cousins in the wild would probably not recognise them any more, and the industrial strains would not survive long without their precisely adjusted cultivation conditions.\n\n---\n\nAs mentioned above, enzymes are used in a wide range of industries and products. But why are they still relatively unknown as ingredients? Well, because they are not exactly ingredients. One of the reasons that enzymes fly under the radar, particularly in food products, is that enzymes are considered processing aids and therefore are not declared on the ingredients list on the package. One single enzyme molecule can catalyse the same chemical reaction millions of times, and so a little goes a long way, and most products only need the addition of minute amounts of enzymes (less than one gram of enzyme per ton of raw material). Furthermore, enzymes only work when the right conditions are provided. As soon as the temperature is sliiightly too high, the enzyme is irreversibly destroyed. When food is heat-treated to kill off any microorganisms in the product, the enzymes added during production are taken care of at the same time.\n\n---\n\nSo back to the process of enzyme production by fungi: what happens to the fungi after they‚Äôve fulfilled their job as enzyme producers? After a few days of happy growth and enzyme secretion in the fermentation tank, all available nutrients in the liquid have been consumed by the fungal cells. The density of mycelium and enzyme has reached a maximum. Now, the fermentation broth is released from the tank and pumped into a large filtration unit where the liquid containing the enzymes is separated from the mycelium, either in a spinning washing machine-like drum, or in big filter presses that squeeze the last bit of liquid out of the mycelium, which at this point resembles wet cotton.\n\nThe liquid is then further concentrated to reduce the volume and finally a thick, viscous, honey-like substance chock-full of enzymes is obtained. This liquid is either shipped to customers directly, or spray-dried to get a fine enzyme powder. For specialised research and medical applications, where purity is a particular concern, an additional purification step removes even the smallest non-enzyme particles in the final product (such as some remaining nutrients, fungal metabolites, etc.).\n\nThe filtered-off fungal mycelium is heated to kill the cells and then dried and milled into a powder. This fungi powder can then be used as animal feed or as fertilizer and spread on fields. So in a nice example of circularity, the nutrients in the fungal cells may help grow the grains that will then again be used as a nutrient source in a future fungi fermentation process.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode, **part 2 of ‚ÄúFungal products everywhere‚Äù** we‚Äôll meet our friend _Aspergillus niger_ again and dive into the acids and pharmaceuticals that fungi make. Until then, enjoy the rest of May!\n\n---\n\n_This was issue #4 of  Ñilaments.

Citric acid is used in many more industries than you can imagine. It‚Äôs a common flavour additive in drinks and candy, it‚Äôs used as an acidic food preservative, it makes ice cream and cheese creamier, and it provides the fizz in products like bath bombs and effervescent tablets. It‚Äôs also used in bathroom and kitchen cleaning products, laundry detergents, cosmetics, and [in anything from heroin to soldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2). More than [two million tonnes](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-citric-acid-markets-report-2011-2018--2019-2024-300814817.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) are produced each year, virtually all by fungal fermentation.\n\n![](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/64c38c17-3f4b-4994-8ecb-5999bf0b0e8a.167ac15c41ac895c3c1b9f76232a1890.jpeg?odnWidth=undefined\u0026odnHeight=undefined\u0026odnBg=ffffff) _Source: walmart.com_\n\n---\n\nThis hasn‚Äôt always been the case. For a long time, up until the beginning of the 20th century, citric acid was extracted from lemons and limes (hence the name), which contain up to 8% of the substance. Through a tedious process involving adding calcium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, about a kilogram of citric acid could be obtained from 500 lemons.\n\nItaly was, as the main producer of citrus fruits at the time, also the main producer of citric acid. As demand for citric acid grew during the late 1800s, the availability of citrus fruits proved the bottleneck, and the industry was ‚Äúripe for [disruption](https://rethinkdisruption.com/citric-acid/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2)‚Äù, as we would phrase it nowadays. That disruption came in several steps.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/cFDdEQMGh6UDe/giphy.gif) _Source: giphy.com_\n\n---\n\nFirstly, German chemist and mycologist Carl Wehmer [discovered in the 1890s](https://books.google.se/books?id=fdBMcYg_xGYC\u0026pg=PA140\u0026redir_esc=y\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false) that a specific mould (a filamentous fungus), could produce citric acid when growing on top of a sugar solution. Wehmer called the mould Citromyces (it was later reclassified as Penicillium) and filed a patent for the process in 1893.\n\nMaking citric acid without needing to grow, water and harvest lemons was ground-breaking and hopes were high that this process could work as a replacement. Together with a French textile chemicals company, Wehmer ran trials in large wooden fermentation pans that were stirred by hand. Knowledge about fungal fermentation was still in its early days though, and the fungi often died because they generated more heat during growth than they could tolerate. Nevertheless, the researchers managed to obtain several tens of kilos of citric acid.\n\nHowever, high costs and a lot of problems with contamination by other microbes during cultivation - again, knowledge about microbiology was not so advanced then - limited the success of citric acid production by fungal fermentation. For another while, chemical extraction from lemons and limes seemed much easier and continued to be the method of choice for industrial production.\n\n![](https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0059171/full/1024%2C/0/default.jpg) _Penicillium fungus growing on the surface of a liquid containing nutrients.

Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)._\n\n---\n\nBut more disruption was coming. World War I unsettled the Italian citrus fruit and citric acid exports, and in addition in 1918 the Spanish Flu brought a sudden craze for lemons as a [flu cure](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/foods-that-protect-against-viruses?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2). Prices skyrocketed and a discovery made a few years earlier by American food chemists [Boleslas Zahorski (1913)](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e8/04/a4/05679aaa71d0d7/US1066358.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) and [James Currie (1917)](https://www.jbc.org/content/31/1/15.full.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) suddenly took centre stage.\n\nTheir inventions described citric acid production that was based on Wehmer‚Äôs fermentation method, but instead of Penicillium they used a different fungus - _Aspergillus niger_. They found that this fungus could grow in strongly acidic conditions, while contaminating microbes could not. _A. niger_ also produced more citric acid than Penicillium.\n\n---\n\nA small US chemicals company called Pfizer hired James Currie to develop the citric acid fermentation process further and commercialised production in 1919. It was a huge success and transformed the citric acid industry completely in just a few years. The newly developed production was stable and much more efficient than extraction from fruits. Already by 1930, over 90% of citric acid worldwide was produced with fungi.\n\nThis method remains the preferred approach for citric acid production today (as well as a range of enzymes, as described in [Episode 4](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2)). But that‚Äôs not where its impact ends. The expertise in fermentation technology that Pfizer gained through citric acid production was later applied to the mass production of other chemicals, including antibiotics during WWII, which paved the way for Pfizer to become one of the largest pharma companies in the world.\n\n---\n\nIt took another 40 years and a lot of scientific research (yielding [at least 2 nobel prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#Discovery)) for the exact biochemical pathways of citric acid production inside (fungal) cells to be understood, and it was only then that production conditions could really be optimised in a targeted way. Improving microbial strains and increasing productivity is still a topic of research and of enormous commercial value today.\n\nYou might be curious as to how this is done. The classic approach is to introduce mutations into the fungal genome, often by UV or gamma radiation. Then the resulting mutants are screened to - by chance - find high producers. However, techniques have been developed in the last decades that involve genomic sequencing and inserting or deleting specific genes in a [more intentional way](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-019-1064-6?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) (as is also done in fungal enzyme production. In this way, strains can be developed that not only produce more product, but can also grow and consume growth materials that were previously unsuitable, such as waste from agriculture.\n\n---\n\nInterestingly, a staggering one million tonnes of fungal biomass are produced each year as a side product from citric acid production alone (as well as over 10 million tonnes of fungal and bacterial biomass from other acid fermentations), making it an undervalued, high-protein resource that could be used in food supplements and food production. Currently, this material is used to feed animals or is spread on fields, but there‚Äôs no reason why it couldn‚Äôt be more efficiently used as a direct protein source for humans.\n\n---\n\nOh, and if you‚Äôre wondering what happened to the less-optimal citric acid production process discovered by Carl Wehmer in the 1890s, then you might be interested to know that it had far greater impact in another industry. While not ideal for Wehmer‚Äôs Penicillium mould, lactic acid bacteria thrived [under the conditions provided](https://books.google.se/books?id=fdBMcYg_xGYC\u0026pg=PA140\u0026redir_esc=y\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false). The lactic acid that these microbes produce is another widely used ingredient in food and pharmaceutical products.\n\nWehmer started work as a consultant for industrial chemical producer Albert Boehringer, and developed his lactic acid production by bacterial fermentation on an industrial scale. The company that Boehringer founded, Boehringer Ingelheim, is today, like Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode, we‚Äôll round up ‚ÄúFungal products everywhere‚Äù with a look at all the medical uses that fungi (can) have.

What is not as firmly established is that CMNs (i.e. physical, continuous linkages among the roots of at least two different individual plants, by the same genetic individual of mycorrhizal fungus) have the potential to mediate plant-plant interactions and plant performance via the transfer of molecules among plants (e.g. seedling getting stronger because of nutrients being delivered from a nearby mature tree). \n\n### Three popular claims about CMNs\n#### Claim 1: CMNs are widespread in forests\n- Strong evidence that CMNs exist in general and do transfer nutrients: **Mycoheterotrophs**, i.e. plants that acquire carbon from mycorrhizal fungi colonizing the roots of other plants. \n- With current technology it's difficult to confirm that continuous, non-transient mycelial connections exist between trees in the field. The permanence of fungal connections is unknown. \n- It's hard to impossible to track a the hyphae originating from a single spore to different trees and root systems. \n- Support for this claim is limited, owing to the paucity of information on CMN structure and dynamics. Too few forests have been mapped, and even fewer studies (two so far) demonstrate actual continuity of fungal links among trees. \n\n\n#### Claim 2: Resources are transferred through CMNs\n- Implicit claim: Fungi forming CMNs are physical extensions of roots, i.e. passive conduits in which the direction of resouce flow is determined by plants. But mycorrhizal fungi don't always benefit their plant partners, but can e.g. aggrevate nitrogen limitation. \n- Unresolved, because CMN-mediated interplant resource transfer has not been conclusively demonstrated. \n- Radioactive labelling studies demonstrated the movement of 14C more than 20 cm from one seedling to the roots of another. Autoradiography has definitely demonstrated movement of carbon from one tree seedling to the mycorrhizal roots of another via a CMN. But isoptopes can be transferred through soil (soil solution) as well, not just fungal hyphae. \n- A single peer-reviewed study exists that has addressed the phenomenon of signalling among forest tree species in response to insect damage. But the signals could have transferred through root connections as well. However, there is good evidence for CMN-mediated transport of defence signals in a well-controlled investigation on bean plants. \n- We shouldn't draw too many conclusions from pot studies, since the conditions in a mature forest might be quite different. Also, most laboratory studies on resouce transfer lack the full suite of controls required to interpret the results properly and overlook important things, like neighbouring roots. \n- \n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.381433092Z","tags":null},"/fungi/Yellow-oyster-mushrooms":{"title":"Growing yellow oyster mushrooms","content":"\n_August 2020_\n\nOrdered yellow oyster mushroom growing kit from [Saxtorps Svamp](https://www.saxtorpsvamp.se/) in Sk√•ne.

The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

Vor allem weil so viele andere Leute auch herumreisen. \nIch muss sagen ich genie√ü es echt mit Duncan alleine zu feiern, weils echt chillig ist. Der Nachteil ist aber, dass sich die normalen Traditionen aber pl√∂tzlich so komisch erzwungen oder unn√∂tig anf√ºhlen. Sollen wir √ºberhaupt dekorieren? Weihnachtsbaum kaufen? Bei Weihnachten zuhause (also mit Eltern etc.) ist es wichtig dass das kleine Hexenh√§uschen von der Tante aus Wien am Baum h√§ngt, und dass das Gl√∂ckchen l√§utet wenn Bescherung ist, und dass die Kartoffel immer auf die gleiche Art gekocht werden, und dass es die Aniskekse gibt die eh eigentlich niemand mag, usw. Und wenn man dann alleine feiert ist es eigentlich wurscht ob man um 5 isst oder um 7, und die Kekse gibts auch nicht, und der Baum ist zu klein f√ºr Dekoration, und Singen unterm Baum ist auch uncool. Auch wieder schade. N√§chstes Jahr vielleicht doch wieder mit Familie.\n\nCool, Bristol, war ich noch nie. Aber vielleicht komm ich im Mai hin! Duncan's Schwester heiratet im Mai (sie hattens eigentlich schon f√ºr Mai 2020 geplant gehabt, aber dann verschoben), in der N√§he von Brighton. Und ich will ein bisschen herumfahren, weil ich von England/UK eigentlich nur London, Reading und ein paar Orte an der S√ºdk√ºste kenne (Brighton, Torquay, Eastbourne, Bournemouth). Bristol und Cardiff w√§ren cool, und auch ein bisschen weiter nach Wales oder vielleicht sogar Schottland. Mh, muss meine Erwartungen etwas runter schrauben. Schottland ist glaub ich ein separater Urlaub...\n\nViel Gl√ºck mit plant-based! :) Ich bin nicht komplett vegan, \"nur\" vegetarisch. Aber so viele meiner Lieblingsrezepte sind vegan, also wenn du Inspiration brauchst schick ich dir ein paar ;) Der Trick ist asiatisch zu kochen, oder auch middle eastern, ostafrikanisch, mexikanisch... also praktisch alles bis auf mitteleurop√§isch, haha. Ich liiiiebe koreanisch, weil ich total auf Kimchi stehe. Indisch ist auch immer super, da gibts so viele grandiose vegane Gerichte die auch super zum vorkochen sind. Und in letzter Zeit steh ich auch voll auf √§thiopisch/eritr√§isch. Wir hatten in G√∂teborg ein East African Restaurant ums Eck, und das war sooo gut! Hab mir dann diese Gew√ºrzmischung Berbere zusammengemixt, und jetzt koch ich fast jede Woche dieses eine √§thiopische Linsengericht das ich so liebe. \nOmg, das h√∂rt sich jetzt voll middle-aged an, aber vorkochen ist echt super. Wir haben keine Kantine in der Arbeit, nur so einen Convini K√ºhlschrank/Gefrierschrank mit App und Fertigsachen. Nix schmeckt wirklich und vor allem wenn man nur was schnelles will gibts nur traurige, kalte, weiche K√§seweckerl. Schweden braucht bessere B√§ckereien... Gibt zwar gute s√º√üe Sachen (Zimtschnecken, etc.) aber mit pikanten Sachen schauts schlecht aus. \n\nOjojoj, das Thema Kinder... Ja, an das ver(sch)wende ich auch ziemlich viel Zeit. Ich kann dich VOLL verstehen, bin praktisch in genau der selben Situation. Unentschlossen, tendenzielle eher nein, aber unsicher obs die richtige Entscheidung ist. Hatte nie diesen Kinderwunsch oder Verlangen,... irgendwie beneide ich das ja wenn man sich so sicher ist dass man Familie und Kinder und Haus etc. haben will. Ich hab nix gegen Kinder, finde sie eigentlich auch ganz s√º√ü (vor allem so Kleinkindalter), aber vernarrt war ich nie in Kinder. Und dann das alles drum und dran mit Schreien und Quengeln und zur Schule bringen und alles unordentlich und klebrig, und kein Schlaf und keine Freiheit, und alles alles dreht sich nur ums Kind... Will ich daf√ºr wirklich mein echt gutes Leben aufgeben? Oder kann man Kinder haben ohne sich selbst aufzugeben und nur von Kindern zu reden?? \nDuncan ist echt kein Kinderfan, f√ºr ihn ist das Thema eigentlich recht einfach. Aber nat√ºrlich ist er offen daf√ºr wenns ein starker Wunsch von mir w√§re. Ist es aber nicht. Aber irgendwas nagt doch an mir. Es w√§re einfacher wenn der Partner voll daf√ºr w√§re, dann k√∂nnt ich mich wahrscheinlich mitrei√üen lassen. \nLustigerweise ist meine Schwester in genau der selben Situation, und die ist auch 1.5 Jahre √§lter als ich... Es gibts zwar keinen Druck von den Eltern (au√üer hie und da zaghaftes Nachfragen), aber irgendwie tuts mir schon leid wenn Enkerl verw√∂hnen und kunterbunte Geburtstagsfeiern usw. in ihrer Zukunftsvorstellung waren, und jetzt keine der beiden T√∂chter in die Richtung tendiert.\nDuncan's Entscheidung ist recht pragmatisch, er will vor allem wegen √úberbev√∂lkerung, Klimakrise, etc. nicht weiter dazu beitragen. Ich muss sagen, er hat auch relativ wenig Toleranz f√ºr Schlafentzug, Ungeplantes, Schreierei und Getrampel. Und ich will keinen ungl√ºcklichen Partner haben und eine gute Beziehung aufs Spiel setzen nur weil ich mir denke wir sollten Kinder haben. Ich hab relativ viel nachgeforscht, und es ist unbestritten dass Kinder eine totale Belastung f√ºr die Beziehung sind (vor allem wenns ein etwas einseitiger Wunsch ist). \nTja, und dann sieht man doch all die gl√ºcklichen Instagram Familien, und √ºberall wird suggeriert dass Kinder die Kr√∂nung des Lebens sind, und man denkt sich dass man wenn man √§lter ist doch gerne eine Anbindung an die j√ºngere Generation h√§tte. Und dass so Traditionen wie zu Weihnachten vielleicht doch irgendwie albern sind wenn man sie an keinen weitergeben kann.\n\nAlso, wie du siehst, es besch√§ftigt mich auch. Und es hilft absolut nicht dass Schweden das Elternparadies schlechthin ist! So viel Karenz und Elternteilzeit und freie Tage usw. wie in Schweden kriegt man nirgends! Jeder einzelne meiner Arbeitskollegen hat Kinder, und zu jedem Zeitpunkt sind mindestens 3 in meiner Abteilung schwanger. \n\nDas einzige wo ich mir sicher bin ist dass ich selbst keine Lust drauf hab schwanger zu werden. F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich war Adoption immer die logischere Wahl. Aber ist halt auch kein einfacher Weg. Und man muss sich da wohl NOCH sicherer sein, dass man Kinder will, wenn man sich jahrelang mit dem Adoptionsprozess herumschlagen muss und dutzende Male beschreiben muss wie gro√ü nicht der Kinderwunsch ist. \n\nJa, guten schlauen Rat hab ich keinen. In Diskussionsforen ist der Konsensus eigentlich immer ungef√§hr so (von Eltern): \"Nein, ich bereue absolut nicht dass ich meine Kinder bekommen habe, ich liebe sie √ºber alles und w√ºrde alles f√ºr sie tun. Aber es ist eine totale Umstellung, dein Leben ist nicht mehr wirklich deines, deine Beziehung ist unter einer Belastungsprobe (aber wird wom√∂glich auch gest√§rkt), deine Priorit√§ten ver√§ndern sich total, Kinder sind nicht f√ºr jeden und wenn man sich unsicher ist sollte man keine haben da es echt eine gro√üe Herausforderung ist\", usw. \n\n\n\n## 2022-07-31\nHallo!! Danke sch√∂n f√ºr die Geburtstagsw√ºnsche :) \n\nWir haben gerade schwedischen Hochsommer, d.h. 22 Grad und Sonnenschein. Recht angenehm, und gerade genug um doch ab und zu ins Wasser zu springen. Ich hab diese Idee dass ich gerne Winterschwimmen w√ºrde, aber ich bin im Sommer auch nicht wirklich eine Wasserratte. Bzw. ich bin kein Strandliegetyp - das ist mir zu langweilig. Deswegen wirds meistens doch eher wandern im Wald als ein Tag am Strand. Aber ich bin gerne IM Wasser. \nMan h√∂rt ja so viel Gutes √ºbers Kaltwasserschwimmen - dass es die Stimmung anhebt und das Immunsystem und den Kreislauf und eigentlich alles. Mal schauen... es gibt hier in Helsingborg immer ein Gr√ºppchen Leute die bei Wind und Wetter am Ufer stehen und reinh√ºpfen, vielleicht schlie√ü ich mich denen an. \n\nHast du Urlaub? Wie verbringst du den Sommer? \nDuncan und ich hatten schon Anfang April ein paar Tage (Norwegen-Zugtrip), dann noch eine Woche im Mai f√ºr die Hochzeit seiner Schwester in England und Anfang Juli eine Woche wo seine Familie uns in Helsingborg besuchte. War voll nett, aber ist halt recht viel Familie. Jetzt arbeite ich f√ºr ein paar Wochen, was recht chillig ist, weil die meisten meiner Kollegen f√ºr 4-6 Wochen auf Sommerurlaub sind. Sehr wenige Emails, sehr wenige Meetings - perfekt! \nEnde August kommt dann meine Familie und wir verbringen eine Woche in einem Sommerhaus an der S√ºdk√ºste. Da heiratet dann meine Schwester. Der Urlaub war schon seit letztem Herbst geplant und gebucht, und sie und ihr Partner haben sich dann mehr oder weniger spontan im Fr√ºhling entschieden w√§hrend des Urlaubs in Schweden zu heiraten. Sie wollen es eh im megakleinen Kreis halten und nicht viel Trara und Planerei haben. \n\nVoll cool dass deine Schwester in Bristol ist! Duncan und ich waren im Mai auf einen kurzen Abstecher dort. Wir waren ja bei der Hochzeit seiner Schwester in der N√§he von Brighton, und dann ein paar Tage in Torquay (wo seine Eltern eine Ferienwohnung haben). Von dort machten wir einen Tagesausflug nach Bristol.\nJa, voll nette Stadt! Wir wanderten ein bisschen herum, gingen √ºber die gro√üe Br√ºcke, spazierten durch ein paar Parks und trafen dann einen seiner Arbeitskollegen. Duncan arbeitet die halbe Woche f√ºr die britische climate charity Possible und ist dort haupts√§chlich in deren Car Free Cities campaigns involviert. Da gehts darum St√§dte mehr Radfahrer- und Fu√üg√§nger-freundlich zu machen. \n\nApropos Radfahren: ich hab noch gar nicht erw√§hnt wie UNGLAUBLICH COOL es ist dass du ein Buch geschrieben hast!!!! Echt Wahnsinn! Ich habs schon bestellt, freu mich schon sehr √ºber deine Abenteuer zu lesen.\n\nDu bist jederzeit herzlich willkommen in Helsingborg! W√ºrd mich echt freuen wenn wir uns mal wieder sehen w√ºrden. Ich hab vor im Herbst/Winter nach √ñsterreich zu fahren, und ich nehm seit einigen Jahren immer den Zug (via Hamburg, N√ºrnberg, etc.) - mal Nachtzug, mal √ºber Tags. Ich k√∂nnte ja vielleicht einen Abstecher machen? Oder wir k√∂nnten uns irgendwo am Weg treffen?  \n\nAlles Liebe! \n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Briefe-und-Karten/Christmas-cards-for-family-and-friends":{"title":"","content":"#family #christmas #holidays #contacts #addresses #love #relationships #greetings #post #mail\n\n\n# 2020 Christmas cards\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2020%20Review/photos/Christmas%20card.jpg)\n\nTante Gerti + Onkel Harald\nDanke sch√∂n f√ºr die liebe Karte! Ich hab mich wirklich sehr gefreut! \nUnser Jahr war zwar Coronabedingt etwas ruhiger als sonst, aber ereignisreich war es trotzdem. Nachdem ich meinen Job nach langem √úberlegen im Juli gek√ºndigt habe, g√∂nnte ich mir ein paar Wochen Auszeit, und dann f√ºllten sich die Tage schon wieder mit einerseits Jobsuche, und andererseits Weiterbildung. Ich wollte meine Programmierkenntnisse auffrischen und ausbauen, intensiver Schwedisch lernen, mehr in meinem Wissenschaftsbereich lesen und auf dem laufenden bleiben etc. Und da ich mir nach und nach √ºberlegte, mich mit einem Fermentations-Unternehmen selbst√§ndig zu machen, hatte ich da auch sehr viel zu √ºberlegen, planen, lesen, etc. Aber wie ihr vielleicht schon wisst ist jetzt doch ein Jobangebot daher gekommen das ich fast nicht abschlagen konnte. Ich fange am 27. J√§nner bei Oatly in der Forschung an. Oatly macht vorranging Hafermilch und andere Haferprodukte und hatte in den letzten Jahren einen unglaublichen Zuwachs. Sie wollen die Forschungsabteilung stark ausbauen und ich bewarb mich f√ºr die Enzyme Technology Specialist Stelle. Nach einem √ºber 2-monatigen Auswahlverfahren mit 5 Interviews, Pers√∂nlichkeitstest etc. bekam ich dann vorgestern das Angebot. Es war keine leichte Entscheidung, da es bedeutet dass wir umziehen m√ºssen, und dass ich mich vorerst nicht selbstst√§ndig mache. Aber ich dachte f√ºr ein paar Jahre kann ich das probieren, Erfahrungen sammeln und sehr wahrscheinlich besser verdienen als wenn ich meine eigene Firma h√§tte. Ich kann mich dann noch immer selbstst√§ndig machen. Und so gut mir G√∂teborg und unsere Wohnung gef√§llt, es ist auch einmal wieder spannend was anderes zu sehen. Oatly ist in Landskrona, eine kleine Stadt am Meer zwischen Malm√∂ und G√∂teborg. Zum Wohnen kommen Landskrona, Helsingborg oder Lund in Frage. Wir werden in den n√§chsten Wochen schauen was es da so gibt und vielleicht ein paar Tage in der jeweiligen Stadt verbringen. In Coronazeiten ist das nat√ºrlich nicht so einfach. Zugfahren ist momentan nicht angenehm und wollen wir so gut es geht vermeiden. Wohnung k√∂nnen momentan auch nicht besichtigt werden (sondern man muss mit Fotos und Plan zufrieden sein). Aber daf√ºr gibt es auch Einschr√§nkungen bei der Firma: man darf nur h√∂chsten 3 Tage pro Woche vor Ort anwesend sein, der Rest ist von zuhause aus. Also zumindest am Anfang w√§re Wochenend-pendeln und eine kleine Wohnung auch eventuell m√∂glich, mit dem Zug ist man in 3h in G√∂teborg. Unsere G√∂teborger Wohnung geben wir nicht auf. L√§ngerfristig werden wir sie vermieten, und bis dahin w√§re es nett wenn wir sie f√ºr Besucher zur Verf√ºgung h√§tten. Also wenn ihr hoffentlich n√§chstes Jahr auf die Lofoten fahren k√∂nnt, dann k√∂nnt ihr einen Zwischenstopp in G√∂teborg machen! \nDuncan hat auch einen neuen Job, er f√§ngt im Neuen Jahr bei der Organisation Possible in London an, die sich f√ºr Klima-positive Sachen einsetzt. Er wird deren Information Designer und ist verantwortlich daf√ºr dass die gesammelten Daten gut aufbereitet und der √ñffentlichkeit verf√ºgbar gemacht werden. Der Job ist Standort-unabh√§ngig. 2.5 Tage pro Woche wird er f√ºr Possible arbeiten, und den Rest der Zeit arbeitet er nach wie vor freiberuflich mit anderen Klienten. Also ein guter Mix. \nIch hoffe ihr verbringt ein sch√∂nes Weihnachtsfest und k√∂nnt trotz allem ein paar Familienmitglieder sehen. Wir feiern heuer zu dritt: Duncan, ich und ein Freund von uns der in der Nachbarschaft wohnt und sonst alleine w√§re.

Danke f√ºr die liebe Karte die gestern im Postkastl gelandet ist.\nDas letzte Jahr war trotz Corona relativ ereignisreich, mit Jobwechseln, Welpenchaos und Umzug nach Helsingborg. Jetzt √ºber die Weihnachtsfeiertage haben wir nicht viel vor, ausser gut essen und viel spazierengehen.  \nIch hoffe wir sehen uns bald mal wieder, ich w√ºrde gerne wieder einmal etwas l√§nger nach √ñsterreich kommen. Und nat√ºrlich seid ihr herzlich willkommen in Helsingborg, wenn reisen wieder etwas einfacher ist. Mit dem Zug ist man vom Kopenhagener Flughafen in einer Stunde hier, sehr praktisch.  \nAlles Liebe von Silvia, Duncan \u0026 Laika\n\n### √ñhlinger --\u003e email oder Whatsapp\n      \n\nHallo! \n\nDankeeee f√ºr das liebe Weihnachtspackerl!!! üôÇ \n\nHoffe es geht euch allen gut. \n\nJa, ich hoffe auch dass wir uns bald mal wieder sehen. Ich w√ºrd ja gerne wieder einmal etwas l√§nger nach √ñsterreich kommen. Aber nat√ºrlich w√ºrde ich mich auch unheimlich √ºber Besuch freuen. Ihr seid allzeit herzlich willkomen. Momentan ist es allerdings grau(slich) und etwas deprimierend (zumindest sch√∂ne Weihnachtsbeleuchtung √ºberall!). Gscheiten Winter gibts in S√ºdschweden leider nicht. Es schneit zwar ab und zu, aber das wird dann schnell wieder Matsch. Aber daf√ºr sind Fr√ºhling/Sommer umso besser. \n\nBei uns in der Firma ist noch immer die Regel dass man nur wenn wirklich notwendig in die Firma kommen und wenn m√∂glich von daheim aus arbeiten soll. Das ist ja an und f√ºr sich eh nicht schlecht, aber man f√ºhlt sich halt doch etwas faul wenn man nur zwischen Bett, Schreibtisch und K√ºche hin und her geht. Ich fahr gerne in die Arbeit; die Zugfahrt ist nett, dann hab ich 10 min mit dem Rad, und dann mach ich Experimente im Labor und plaudere mit Kollegen. Wenn ich von daheim aus arbeite sind zumindest die Spazierg√§nge mit Laika eine willkommene Notwendigkeit. \n\nIn Helsingborg haben wir noch nicht wirklich Anschluss gefunden. Wegen Corona ist halt alles sehr eingeschr√§nkt. Und meine Arbeitskollegen sind zwar alle sehr nett, aber die meisten wohnen erstens nicht in Helsingborg sonder irgendwo am Land oder in Lund oder Malm√∂, und zweitens haben ausnahmslos alle Familien mit Kindern und sind da voll eingespannt. Ist halt nicht mehr so leicht wie auf der Uni ein paar Freunde zum spontanen Spielabend, Bier nach der Arbeit oder sonnt√§glichen Wandern zu finden. Aber im neuen Jahr werd ich das angehen. üí™Man kann ja schon mal ein paar Monate etwas einsiedlerisch leben, aber mittlerweile merk ich schon dass ich mich nach ein bisschen mehr Kontakt sehne. Ich hab vor ein paar Vereine zu finden, entweder Sport oder was handwerkliches, oder vielleicht irgendwo lokal engagieren. \n\nAnsonsten gef√§llt mir die Arbeit aber wirklich gut und ich bereue es auch nicht dass wir nach Helsingborg gezogen sind. Mit unseren Freunden in G√∂teborg haben wir nach wie vor guten Kontakt, und wir wollen im neuen Jahr auch wieder √∂fter nach G√∂teborg fahren. \n\nSo, jetzt erstmal ein paar entspannte Tage mit viel gutem Essen. \n\nHabt sch√∂ne Weihnachtsfeiertage und liebe Gr√º√üe an alle! \n\nSilvia, Duncan \u0026 Laika\n### Holzinger --\u003e email oder Whatsapp/Telegram\n      \n\nHallo! \n\nDanke f√ºr die liebe Weihnachtskarte! :) Freut mich zu h√∂ren dass alle gesund sind und dass Schulter und Bein am Weg der Besserung sind. \n\nJa, graue dunkle Nebeltage haben wir auch zur Gen√ºge hier und es ist wirklich gut oft raus zu gehen.

What‚Äôs the story arc of your life right now? What would you tell your past selves about how their efforts are paying off?_\n\nThings are going quite well, even though 2020 has been crazy so far (and it might get even crazier with the US presidential elections happening tomorrow). There's a pandemic going on, which is strange and changed the lives of most people on earth. I haven't been anywhere really in the last 9 months, not further than walking distance from home basically. Most of the time it's ok, but there are times when I feel quite trapped and want to visit my parents and sister, etc. \nSo aside from that, I also quit my promising start-up CTO job, because my boss was a dick, tried to come to terms with some private stuff, and I'm now trying to figure out what my next \"career steps\" are going to be. What do I want to do for the next years? Should I start my own business? Should I move to another country? I'm super indecisive and I'm not sure there's a right answer to any of these questions. \nI was worried when I quit at Mycorena that I might soon regret it and feel like I threw away an opportunity. But, after a few weeks of feeling a bit stressed because of it, I feel much better now. Life's too short to be mistreated. It was a good decision to move on. I learned a LOT during my Mycorena times and I feel now much more prepared for the \"real\" job market than after my Chalmers time. \n\n**For each current quest** ‚Äî _How is it going? Are there habits or attitudes you can put in place to make it go better? Should it continue being an active quest, or should you mark it paused, completed, or abandoned?_\n\n_- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person._\nI just recently started doing a bit more exercise (HIIT), and I want to continue doing that. I also want to make more time for meditation and yoga.\n_- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear._\nSewing has less priority for me now, because I started doing much more coding, generative art, plotting, fungi newsletter, fermentation, etc. I think for now it could be **paused** until I find the time again to take something on like this. It's also easier to make summer clothes, so for at least half a year I won't make sewing a priority.\n_- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. _\nNot sure if I am doing well there or not. Kind of a squishy quest. I recently tried to be a good friend to Pawel and Ausra, who are both going through a rough time. But to be honest, it's hard to do that well during pandemic times. But I made an effort to write messages. Talking \"feelings\" is still hard for me and I rather switch to \"distraction mode\". \n_- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology)._\nStill a quest, but also quite undefined so far. Either the Mycobrewery idea will become something, or I work on some research questions in a company or research institute. \n_- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. _\nDon't want to pause it, but same as with the other things, it's harder during pandemic times. We try to take long walks through nice forests, which is very good and I take nice photos. But it's hard to be adventerous when everything's so limited. I don't want to pause this quest, but I need to find more ways of making this happen during Covid times.  \n_- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places._\nThis should probably be paused, I haven't really thought about this quest for months. Although now actually would be a great time to be able to drive. We don't really want to take public transport, but also long for a weekend away and a change of scene. To make this quest a higher priority I would have to take some actual steps towards driving more, like renting a car for a day and drive around, practice \"difficult situations\" in my head, etc. Actually, the more I think about being able to drive now, the more I would like to be able to do it. But I also hate cars and traffic, how is that compatibel?\n\n\n**New quests** - _Are there any new quests you should instate, based on your current story arc and where you want the story to go next? Have you read anything or had any conversations lately that contained especially meaningful topics that you want to do something about? What habits or attitudes could support it? What is the purpose of the quest; how does it get you closer to your cadence?_\n\n- Become a comfortable coder, i.e. get to a point in a language where it doesn't feel like such a big thing to start tinkering around and code something. On one hand I enjoy it and want to learn more, on the other hand I want to keep this road open to future job opportunities that are easier to do remotely. To get further in this quest, I should make coding a more regular task and put time aside to do projects, play around, etc. The purpose of this quest, regarding my cadence, is that I don't necessarily want to be bound to one location because of my job.\n- I want to become more of a fungi and fermentation technology expert. I really enjoy the topics around fungi, alternative proteins, food fermentation, etc. and I think that changing our diets to be more vegan/vegetarian/sustainable is one of the most important things, so I want to be able to put my efforts into this area. Fermentation technology, especially fungi, also have the immense potential to produce things and convert things in a very sustainable way, so that's another topic where I want to be involved in and use my time and knowledge. To be more involved in that, I should become a more active member of something like The Good Food Institute, do a good job writing my fungi newsletter, stay up to date with fungi and alternative protein research topics and find a job that allows me to dig deeper into these things. The purpose of this quest, regarding my cadence, is that I want to contribute something meaningful to the world and use my energy for something that is good and useful. \n- Related to above, but more concrete (because of a newly added cadence): Build my profile as a \"fungi and fermentation expert\" more publicly, try new things and write about it, take initiatives, connect with like-minded people. I should make a list of people who do cool stuff and see how I can connect with them, do something similar or be involved with them.\n\n**Ideal self** ‚Äî_ Have you learned anything durable enough that it should be recorded in your Rules or Personal Canon?_\n\nI add \"food fermentation\", because I am very inspired by the people that do it and I want to be one of them. It's a nice combination of using ingredients, trying out things, see microbes at work, make something delicious, reduce food waste, preserve something, be healthy, etc. \n\nI also add \"Breath of the wild\", because it is SUCH a good game and every once in a while I come back to it and it just feels so nice. It's so well made. \n\nI also add \"Craig Mod walking and photography adventures\". I just got really inspired by the way he walks and takes photos of seemingly mundane things, but they are still nice to look at and to share. It's a good way of exploring your surrounding, connecting with the environment and keeping a curious and appreciative eye on everything. \n\n**Cadence** ‚Äî _Does your cadence still reflect where you want your life to go? Can you make it more specific? Do you need to make it a bit more vague? Most importantly, are your quests actually bringing you closer to it?_\n\nIn general the cadence is still true, but it's also quite vague. Therefore, I included a more concrete part about what I (currently) want my future job situtation to be like. I will definitely want to do something with science, and currently fungi and fermentation are my biggest interest. I want to have a research and discovery element to my job, but also an \"outreach\" element which could be courses, books, newsletters, exhibitions, etc. I want to be  a scientist foremost, but have elements of an artist and teacher in it. At the moment, descriptions of people that make me excited are people who do something unusual and combine different things in an exciting way, e.g. a fermentation expert consulting chefs, a curator of a microbe museum, leading a community science center, product development and consultancy for different companies, travelling the world and exploring microbes in different contexts. How do I reach a level of \"expertise\" to do any of these things? Build my profile more publicly, try new things and write about it, take initiatives, connect with like-minded people. That should probably be in my quests then as well, so I'll add it.  \n\n\n**Message from the past** ‚Äî _Say hello to your future selves. What would they appreciate knowing is important to you now?_\n\n\nCurrently I'm very undecided about which job direction I should take in the future. I've put a lot of work into making a business plan for the Mycobrewery, but I am unsure if it's really something I actually want to do. The research jobs, like Oatly or VTT, seem \"safer\", but I also want to dare something. However, in any of these jobs I can continue to develop and go towards my greater goals outline in my cadence. Neither choice is permanent or cuts me off from any other future things. So try to be brave and be confident in yourself. \nOtherwise, look back at 100 days ago and see how much better you're exercising now and how much better your coding skills are than last time! It pays off to do something, right? ;) \n\n[Cadence](private/Cadence/Cadence.md)\n[Cadence Review](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review.md)\n[Cadence spring 2020](private/Cadence/Cadence%20spring%202020.md)\n[Cadence Review 31-10-2021](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review%2031-10-2021.md)\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Cadence/Cadence-Review-31-10-2021":{"title":"","content":"#cadence #personaldevelopment \n\n**Overview** ‚Äî _How is everything going? What‚Äôs the story arc of your life right now? What would you tell your past selves about how their efforts are paying off?_\n\nThings are good! My last cadence review was almost exactly a year ago, since then a lot of things have changed. I started a new job in February (Oatly) and we moved to Helsingborg. I'm very happy with both of these decisions, although I am still a bit sad about leaving Gothenburg. \nOatly job: \nPros: Great company (good product, good missions, respect and care about their employees, etc.), great colleagues and really interesting tasks. So much freedom in doing almost \"blue sky\" research into enzymes or proteins or carbohydrates, etc. Very self-directed. Good pay (though maybe I could have gambled a bit higher? I get 47 000 SEK per month before tax now). \nCons: Things are quite messy, undefined and unstructured. Oatly went from few people to suddenly a lot of new hires, the lab space is not enough, a pandemic is going on, etc. On top of that, the Technology Development team that I am part of is newly established, were missing routines, instructions, aims, prioritization, etc. But this is just something to get comfortable with and work on. Colleague-wise, basically everyone has a family with kids, and the ones that don't live in Malm√∂ or Lund and are pregnant or will get kids soon. Not very international (yet) and therefore a bit awkard with Swedish/English, etc. \n\nHelsingborg: \nPros: Something different! After more than a year of pandemic life, it was really nice to have a bit of a change. Location is very nice (right at the seaside, view of Denmark, close to some interesting cities), pretty medieval buildings, found some really nice restaurants already. Apartment is bigger and airier. Big windows to south and north, big studio room with space for sewing, plotting, soldering, working, reading, etc. \nCons: It's not Gothenburg. Smaller and less choice of things. No East African restaurant, no nearby Ramberget and Hisingsparken, no Bohus klippor. Milder climate (and therefore even less chance of snow than in GBG) and not as much nature (Delsj√∂n, sk√§rg√•rden, etc.). And of course no friends. We had reached such a nice level in GBG that we knew enough great people to hang out with, that it was no problem to just message somone on the weekend to arrange a walk or lunch or whatever. In HBG we know no one. \n\nIn general though I am very happy. I regard this Oatly-Sk√•ne experiment very much as a test to see how we like it here, how things are going, what comes up next, etc. I really like it at Oatly and can imagine working there for quite a while, but we'll see what happens. Maybe I can join the Singapore research team that is supposed to be built up soon? Maybe we'll move to Malm√∂? Maybe something else comes up? Right now, Helsingborg is interesting enough, we found nice nature, we are eager to explore Sk√•ne and Denmark a bit more, want to join some organisations (orienteering? milj√∂partiet?) to get some connections, want to improve our Swedish, etc. \n\n**For each current quest** ‚Äî _How is it going? Are there habits or attitudes you can put in place to make it go better? Should it continue being an active quest, or should you mark it paused, completed, or abandoned?_\n\n_- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person._\nI still struggle with finding a good, consistent schedule to incorporate both yoga and mediation, but also something like HIIT into my life. Of course I'm walking a lot with Laika, but I would like to have more targeted exercise. Though both my physical and mental health have been really good over the last year.\nI will work on dedicating 2 mornings a week to either HIIT or yoga.\n---\u003e ***Pick times for exercise and put it in the calendar. Start a 100 days of x calendar to feel a sense of achievement***\n\n_- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear._\nSewing as a quest was paused during the last year, but I actually made a few things that I am really happy with. I made a pair of comfy linen trousers that I wore almost non-stop in summer. And I made my most advanced project yet: a light-blue corduroy jacket that I also have worn a lot since I've finished it. I am getting to a stage in my sewing where I select my projects a bit more targeted and build up a wardrobe of things that go together well. I also made a few things for Duncan. So I think in general, I am on a good track with this quest. What I still want to improve is to know what to do when e.g. the sleeves are not ideal or when I want to make a more exciting collar. Maybe a Domestika course about drafting your own patterns could be something?\n--\u003e ***Completed***\n\n_- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. _\nI think at work I have made myself already known as a very helpful and reliable person to my colleagues. I make an effort in offering help when they can't come to the lab for example and need something. I like to think that they think of me as someone helpful (without feeling exploited). \nI want to make more effort in keeping in touch with friends in GBG, by either writing to them semi-regularly or visiting occasionally. I want to keep track of their life as well and for example ask about their child or how their job search is going, etc. \n--\u003e ***Make it a recurring task in my to-do list app to check up on friends. Make sure all their birthdays (and their kids?) are in my Google Calendar instead of just on Facebook***\n\n_- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology)._\nThis was very much paused since I started at Oatly. I kept up my fungi newsletter a bit, but it became SO much less of a priority. I also took up a consultancy job for a start-up (Libre Foods) that wants to make mycelium bacon. Bit frustrating, because they don't actually have any technology yet but completely overblown plans. \nNow after 3 months of settling into the new apartment I feel ready to restart fermentation experiments, and also dig a bit deeper into fungi in general (mushrooms, etc.). I do want to keep the link to it, I am interested in it, etc. But I think I will (for now) do it less as a future job opportunity and more like just a hobby. \n--\u003e ***Paused***\n\n_- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. _\nNot so much emphasis on that in the past year, but there were a few things that we did to keep a bit of adventure going, despite the pandemic. We took the train to Bor√•s, we took the boat to Ven, we had a little road trip around Sk√•ne with Chris, I took the train to Austria, we went to Helsing√∂r for a morning. Getting out of the house is good for new ideas and thoughts. It would be nice to have a bit more structure in how to collect and cultivate taste and inspiration. \n--\u003e ***Start using pinterest more to just collect things on the internet that I like***\n\n_- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places._\nStill not progressed. I go back and forth between longing for the ability to just rent a camper van and drive across Europe with Duncan and Laika, and not wanting to drive at all because of traffic, pollution, accidents, etc. Paused for now, I won't take driving lessons in winter. But maybe revamp for next summer? It would open up so many possiblities, but how will I get the confidence to drive for long distances during a holiday, if I don't put in the time to practice for a while?\n--\u003e ***Investigate driving schools in HBG***\n\n_- Become a comfortable coder_\nNot so much progressed, because of lack of time and inspiration about what to do. I'll keep it paused for now, but maybe still work on it a little bit.\nChange in Nov: signed up for a Python course and have actually been working on it every day for the last 2 weeks. It's fun and still quite low level at the moment, but it will soon ramp up the difficulty. It's made for 100 days, but I'll stretch it out over longer. Aim is to do a little bit every day.\nIn addition, Duncan and I are doing Ben Collins' Google Sheets course, which comes in nice 15-30 min chunks, and it's a good evening activity together a few times a week.\n--\u003e ***Work on Python course and finish Google Sheets course***\n\n_- Fungi fermentation technology expert_\nI did work in that area as a freelance consultant during the past months, and did not feel 100% comfortable in that role. To really consider myself an expert, I would have to put in much more time to stay up to date with this very fast-expanding field, be in the start-up circles, Linkedin, etc. Not anything I really want to do right now, it makes me anxious and annoyed. I will continue to be interested in the area, but not in a professional way right now.\n--\u003e ***ended***\n\n\n\n\n**New quests** - _Are there any new quests you should instate, based on your current story arc and where you want the story to go next? Have you read anything or had any conversations lately that contained especially meaningful topics that you want to do something about? What habits or attitudes could support it? What is the purpose of the quest; how does it get you closer to your cadence?_\n\n_- Proficient in Swedish_\nI'm surprised that is not on my list of active quests... Now with a job in an actual Swedish company, I feel the increased need to have at least good conversational Swedish. And getting to know people in Helsinborg will also be so much easier with Swedish. So I'll revamp the Swedish learning efforts and will prepare a structured learning schedule. \n--\u003e ***Prepare Swedish learning schedule that focuses on talking and learning new words***\n\n**Ideal self** ‚Äî_ Have you learned anything durable enough that it should be recorded in your Rules or Personal Canon?_\n\nI added a person on Instagram that I follow. She advocates slow fashion and seems to be in general a nice person. I just get a good vibe from it: calm, cosy, autumn colours, etc. \n\n\n**Cadence** ‚Äî _Does your cadence still reflect where you want your life to go? Can you make it more specific? Do you need to make it a bit more vague? Most importantly, are your quests actually bringing you closer to it?_\n\nIn general the cadence is still true, but it's also quite vague. My last addition was a more concrete job idea that includes fermentation and microbes. Not so sure about that right now, because my current job takes me a bit away from that. But I am still interested in it and want to continue having that as part of my life, activities and identidy, but maybe not necessarily as my day job. We'll see. I'll leave it in for now. \nI got a bit away from being public about what I do. I put a lot of effort in building an fermentation Instram profile, writing the newsletter and posting on Linkedin for a good part of last year. And then (with the new job) I stopped that, and honestly, it feels really good. Just thinking about scrolling through Linkedin makes me anxious and seeing too much of exciting projects that people do feels somehow less inspiring and more stressful and like I don't have enough time and energy to do all that. So yeah, I'll take it a bit easier right now.\n\n\n**Message from the past** ‚Äî _Say hello to your future self. What would they appreciate knowing is important to you now?_\n\n\nOh dear, my last message was about greatly improved coding skills and exercise. That didn't really happen, did it? \nAnyway, hello future self! I hope you found a way to get to know some people in Helsingborg and feel more at home there. It will probably not be the place that you stay in forever (will there ever be one?) but I'm sure it will be a place that feels good for a part of your life. Don't feel stressed about things you haven't achieved yet. Try to see other people's work as inspiration, rather than as a reminder that you don't do enough. Take work seriously, but make sure that at the end of the day you still have energy to do things for yourself. And just start something. Right now, I feel like I want to work on some design skills, like learning pixel art or doing a pattern design course. Who knows where it leads, but I will keep some kind of progress log to be able to look back and be proud and excited of all the things that I tried this year. I think that's the most important thing: try new things, even if you then realise it wasn't for you. Document the outcome, file it away and try the next thing. If there is something that fits you, deepen the knowledge. Just read more about it. Go to the library to find some books about it. Collect pictures of nice patterns. Make a database about edible fungi. Make a garden of projects on your personal website. \n\n[Cadence](private/Cadence/Cadence.md)\n[Cadence Review](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review.md)\n[Cadence spring 2020](private/Cadence/Cadence%20spring%202020.md)\n[Cadence Review 02-11-2020](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review%2002-11-2020.md)\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Cadence/Cadence-spring-2020":{"title":"","content":"#cadence #personaldevelopment \n## List of default activities:\n- Read a bit of pocket article\n- Listen to (new) music\n- Observe the environment (people, nature)\n- Swedish flash cards\n\n## Things I like to do more of: \n- sewing\n- cooking\n- Yoga\n- sports\n- Swedish\n- website\n- reading\n- creating\n\n## My cadence:\n- I sit in the porch of our house in a cosy jumper and drink a morning tea.

Und obwohl Helsingborg jetzt nicht schlecht war, sind wir doch mehr als bereit weg zu ziehen und freuen uns schon sehr auf Malm√∂. Nichtsdestotrotz will ich Erinnerungen von Helsingborg aufschreiben, gute und schlechte:\n\n- Am ersten Tag als wir in Helsinborg wohnten gingen wir in der Gegend in einer Gr√ºnanlage spazieren, die auch als Wasserauffangbecken bei starken Regenf√§llen dient. Dort sahen wir zwei F√ºchse, und seitdem nannten wir es Fox Valley. F√ºchse sahen wir allerdings nie wieder.  \n- Die Friedh√∂fe in der N√§he, durch die wir so oft mit Laika spaziert sind. Mit den alten Grabsteinen, den merkw√ºrdigen Banditos Gr√§bern, den alten B√§umen und dem Grasroboter der unerm√ºdlich seine Runden drehte. \n- Landborgspromenaden. Die F√ºlle an bl√ºhenden Rhododendren auf dem Weg vom Friedh√∂fen, entlang der Anh√∂he, vorbei an den Panzerblockaden vom 2. Weltkrieg, r√ºber zum Krankenhaus, und dann weiter zu K√§rnan und den Terasstrapporna von wo man eine wundersch√∂ne Aussicht auf die Stadt, das Rathaus, das Meer und D√§nemark hat. Und dann weiter, auf und ab, durch verschiedene Parks und Wohngegenden bis man zum P√•lsj√∂skog gelangt, wo man Schwammerlsuppe und Waffeln essen kann. \n- Als das Kind bei uns in der Stra√üe randomly beim Fenster raus hing. Und die Kinder im Innehof, die sich die Lunge aus dem Hals schreien wenn sie Fu√üball spielen, und B√§lle gegen Fenster schleudern, und √Ñste von den B√§umen rei√üen, und die W√§nde im Keller zerst√∂ren. Die Zigarettenstummel die monatelang das Schloss in der Eingangst√ºr verstopften. Der junge Mann der oben bei der Schule erstochen wurde. Der Hauseingang der ein paar Stra√üen weiter weg eines Nachts weggesprengt wurde. Die sehr offensichtlichen Drogendealer die die ganze Zeit bei ihrem \"italienischen Modegesch√§ft\" abhingen. Das Puff/Thaimassage im Erdgeschoss. \n- Attila, der kastenf√∂rmige Hund, den man schon von der Weiter daherschnaufen h√∂rt. \n- Die Klimatavtal-Gang: etwas m√ºhsam teilweise, aber trotzdem gute Leute. Vor allem Margit mag ich gerne - wenn ich alt bin will ich so sein wie sie. Lustig, gut gelaunt, fit, engagiert, etwas forsch aber das Herz am rechten Fleck. \n- Jordbodalen ist definitiv ein Highlight in Helsinborg: ein kleines aber feines Naturreservat entlang eines kleinen Bachs, das fast immer relativ menschenleer ist. Mit Kormoranen und hunderten Kaninchen.\n- Chay, eines der absolut besten vegetarischen Restaurant das ich kenne. Die spring rolls und die Seitangerichte - yummmm. Und South Indian ist auch nicht schlecht. Ich hab mich so in die Uttapams verschossen dass ich sie mittlerweile auch daheim oft koche. Und obwohl ziemlich teuer, finde ich Bruket doch eins der nettesten Caf√©s: stylisch, chillig, sehr viel vegane Sachen, himmlische Kardamummabullar. Omg, und Bruket's Glassbar! War leider nur einen Sommer offen, aber das vegane Eis war au√üerordentlich gut - vor allem das Tahini-Schokoeis. \n- Helsingborg ist sehr sch√∂n am Meer gelegen und macht auch, im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen gro√üen und mittelgro√üen St√§dten an der Westk√ºste, etwas draus. Es gibt eine Hafenpromenade, einen Strand, einen kleinen Leuchtturm und vor allem eine F√§hrenanlegestelle von der F√§hren alle 20 min nach Helsing√∂r r√ºber fahren. Ab und zu ein Schiff nehmen zu k√∂nnen, noch dazu so billig und einfach, ist schon sehr nett. \n- Die gem√ºtliche Bibliothek im Stadtpark, die besonders an einem dunklen Herbstabend so unheimlich einladend aussieht. \n- Das Rathaus ist eins der sch√∂nsten Geb√§ude in Schweden muss ich sagen. \n- Fredriksdal - das Freiluftmuseum das ganz Sk√•ne in Miniatur darstellt. Mit Schweinen und Ziegen und Schafen und H√ºhnern und einem fantastischen Kr√§utergarten. Dieses Jahr feierten wir sogar Midsommar dort. \n- Vorigen Sommer war ich √∂fters schwimmen beim Pixlapiren, in dem alten Hafenbecken. Das Wasser ist tief und klar, und die Umgebung ist etwas schr√§g mit dem kleinen Sandstrand und den Strandk√∂rben, und daneben all die Graffitis und Kunstinstallationen. \n- Aldo, der riesige t√ºrkische Supermarkt mit dem geheimen Untergescho√ü das wir erst nach √ºber einem Jahr entdeckten. \n- Laika ging f√ºr zwei Monate zur Hunddagis G√•seb√§ck. Uff, der Geruch von dem Geb√§ude beim Hinbringen und Abholen am Morgen und Abend! So hundig! Aber Laika kam jedes Mal ziemlich fertig von der Hunddagis heim, deswegen nehm ich an dass sie es gerne dort mochte. Und eine der Betreuerinnen begegnet uns nach wie vor ab und zu auf der Stra√üe und ruft schon von Weitem \"Laika!!!\". Aber im Endeffekt wars dann doch das Geld nicht wert, weil wir uns eigentlich nicht wirklich Zeit ersparten. Und Laika bekam zuerst Kennelhusta, und dan bildete ich mir ein dass sie vielleicht unbemerkt geschw√§ngtert worden war und fuhr mit ihr zum Tierarzt und dann zum R√∂ntgen.\n- Mit der Wohnung war nicht alles perfekt. Am Anfang hatten wir Zigarettenrauchgeruch in der K√ºche, bis dann nach ein paar Monaten die Ventilation repariert wurde. Den gelegentlichen Knoblauchgeruch im Bad konnten wir allerdings nie loswerden. Und das Bad √ºberhaupt! So was schmales hab ich ja noch nie gesehen, Duncan konnte sich nicht mal ordentlich aufs Klo setzen. Aber ich mochte die gro√üen Fenster auf beiden Seiten der Wohnung, das gro√üe Schlafzimmer das an sch√∂nen Tagen von Sonnenlicht durchflutet war und wo Laika am allerliebesten die faulen Nachmittage zusammengerollt am Bett verbrachte.

Better possibilities of visiting family, exploring new cities, Duncan can have more connections in Copenhagen and Malm√∂ and expand his network. We could try living in the countryside/small town for a bit, if we wanted to (might require a car...). \n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\nMoving hassle, very enzyme-focussed (-\u003e away from fungi and fermentation topics), probably not compatible with building up the Mycobrewery more,  potentially long commute (depending on where we live), possibly needing  a car (?), corporate interests, confidential information (instead of open source), probably not easy to work from home or be very flexibel with work hours/place, more away from home. \n\nWhere to go after that job? What would be possible in Gothenburg then? \nRISE, Mycobrewery, Chalmers, some other (food producing) company. Maybe travel around a bit after this job with the money I earned there?\n\nWhich skills would I develop that I don't already have? \nIndustry knowledge, connections in the enzyme and alternative protein field, very in-depth oat knowledge that is definitely of interest for other areas (-\u003e allowed to work with oat products in other companies after that?).\n\n\n**VTT**\nPros/enjoy/know:\nJob description sounds like the perfect combination of fungi research and alternative protein research, well-known research institute, half-way between academia and industry, good connections, new environment (Espoo/Helsinki) is exciting, probably well-equipped lab, seems like typical research job, probably possible to work on Mycobrewery things on the side, make better connections with fungi researchers (I already know a few there), probably relatively easy to leave after 2ish years, I know that I like the lab work and there would be interesting research projects to work on. Best way to (continue to) work with cellular agriculture, alternative proteins (e.g. egg white protein in Trichoderma), would set me up very well to continue a career in cellular agriculture and improving food production systems towards a more sustainable way. \n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\n\"Just another\" research job? Would it be a good career step? Might involve an annoying amount of grant applications. Other cons of typical research jobs: failed experiments, publishing, wasting a lot of (plastic) material. Moving hassle, unknown environment, Finnish (after just getting good at Swedish), probably no effort to integrate too much in Finland, bit bleak (?). I don't really want to do some incremental research about making a yeast a bit more efficient in producing a certain protein. I also don't want to work for others to spin start-ups out of the knowledge. \n\n\n**Mycobrewery**\nPros/enjoy/know:\nDoing my own thing, trying out something new, doing something that I admire in others, many collaboration possibilities (with restaurants, entrepreneurs, companies, shops), pushing myself, flexible work circumstances, prioritise what I think is important, create my own schedule, possibility to try many different ideas at the same time and see what works, good time to do it (now that not too many people are doing something similar yet), supportive environment, not much to lose. Can shape in how I want to contribute to the world. Do something that I think is important, interesting and fun. There will always be a \"normal\" job to take on if the Mycobrewery doesn't work out. I am in quite a unique position to try something like that out (scientific background, financial freedom, good network). I would learn A LOT, from customer relations to food safety, from sales to marketing to the actual food fermentation. Very varied: fermentation research, course planning, product development, experiments, label design, collaborations. I already know a few people who are super enthusiastic about it, and I will probably get to know more. I can stop at any time or make it a \"side thing\" for a while if I want/need to. Staying in Gothenburg and keeping our circle of friends. Contributing to the community here. Can take on other work as well, since I have a way to invoice people. \n\n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\nMany uncertainties: How much will I enjoy it vs. how much will I fret over every decision? Can I chill out enough to take it as a fun experiment (for a limited amount of time)? Is it acutally a good/viable business model? \nLonely work (no team), every decision is up to me in the end, lot of hustling (selling, advertising, finding customers), possibly a lot of initial investment, risky, very location-bound (at least initially), a lot of administrative work that I have to do (insurance, taxes, food safety, etc.). A lot of manual, repetitive work (making the food products). I don't (yet) feel confident enough to go to restaurants and try to sell them my stuff. Responsible for consequences of my products. Less security: social insurance, sick leave, parental benefits, pension, savings. Not much money for at least 3 years. Might not work out at all. No \"sophisticated\" research part, i.e. not really involving a lab and a deep research question. Would it lead me too much away from science and being a scientist/researcher? Is there too much competition already? So many unknowns. \nShould I rather take the chance to move somewhere and try something for  a few years before having a more \"settled\" job?\nIn a way not as \"cool\" as other research jobs, e.g. working on transforming the food production system to be more sustainable (animal-free egg and milk proteins, etc.).\n\n\n**Various consultancy work in GBG**\nPros/enjoy/know:\nPossibly varied (working on different projects over time), can continue to work on Mycobrewery for a while, using different skills, good pay, staying in GBG and keeping our circle of friends. Least \"invested\" option of all, I would probably not be too tied to whatever company I work for, which leaves freedom to let work be work and do other things in my free time. \n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\nNot much say in what I work with, might not be what I would choose to do myself (e.g. Astra working with animal testing, etc.). Questionable how much I could develop my skills (in a structured way). Probably no food-, fermentation- or alternative protein-related tasks. \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Job-thoughts/Job-thoughts-2":{"title":"","content":"#job #mycobrewery #startaeget #career #personaldevelopment #oatly\n\nI've been into fermented, sour foods my whole life, I LOVE them. It's good to make something that you love. \n\nIs Oatly just another oat milk company? Currently cool, but not the only one out there. \n\nWould be ideal to combine a lab job (like Oatly) with doing some fermented food production and courses on the side --\u003e \"demand\" from Oatly to be able to keep the enskild firma on the side. \n\nNo one in Gothenburg and around is doing tempeh and fermented food production. This seems like an obvious gap. There are people who found new successful companies in a much more saturated market. \n\nFermentation in food production has a crazy boom right now, it would be silly to not try to get in on this? \n\nIf Mycobrewery, I could stay much better in the alternative protein field that I am most interested in. With Oatly I'd be IN the field, but in a much narrower field. \n\nCapacity to look into other more exciting applications at Oatly? Cheese, \"meat\", etc.? Would that be me doing that?\n\nFree evenings and weekends to do things I love sound very nice. With an own business I would probably always do something for it. \n\nWould having a business in GBG make us \"stuck\" even more here? Do I want that? \n\nNew adventure to live in a different place.

What is the worst thing that could happen? I have savings and most likely get starta eget st√∂d for at least half a year. That allows me to try out things and see how it goes. I can do everything exactly how I want to. I can produce what I want, design packages and labels how I want, market it how I want, give courses. I can work together with other people on exciting projects, visit different places that produce things, source new materials, learn from others, teach others, exchange knowledge, exchange products, make people excited about my field, etc. \nWith this work I can contribute to making exciting local things, which is something that people (including me) really like and want to buy. I get excited about soda from GBG, chocolates from GBG, so why not fermented food things from GBG?\n\nIdeal situation: \nI have a nice production place that I can set up how I like it. It's a nice space and I enjoy being there. It's clean and bright and different things are going on. I make great products that I neatly package and deliver to different places. It sells well and people love my stuff. It's fun to experiment around and I have established a subscription system where I can try out new products. There's a nice community of other people producing local delicacies. I'm excited about doing some new projects in the summer, like doing a food truck with some friends/colleagues, giving some courses, etc. I am building a whole little speciality shop with all fermented products. We live in our nice apartment and I have a little odlingslott at Frihamnen. \nThere are occasional consultancy gigs that are paying well, and where people want to me look into fermentation-related subjects. I also teach a university course in food fermentation. I'm still doing my fungi newsletter and I'm up to date and involved in the alternative protein field. \nIt's good that I started this business because people are really interested in fermented food products, for health and taste reasons, and I even think about opening a web shop. \n--\u003e I think it's likely that the interest for fermented food products is only growing and that people are excited about GBG-produced products. Of course it will be a hassle to sell things, but maybe it's also fun to get people excited about my products. In between the production I have enough time to work on other projects that are related to my area of expertise and I feel like I'm contributing to the field and it's nice to collaborate with other people. \n\nWorst situation: \nI try to get something going, but the interest is not really there. I get a bit bored making food and worry that people don't like the taste or that it goes bad. It doesn't sell well and I stand at REKO Ring and sell 5 jars. In between it's a lot of hustling and I don't feel like I'm doing enough intellectually challenging things or using my knowledge best. Consultancy gigs are sparse, I just don't have the industry knowledge that companies want. I invested quite a lot of money into the business and haven't earned much. \n--\u003e Producing and selling the products will at times feel a bit menial and like not what I actually want to do. It's hard work and it feels like it's not paying off. My former colleagues are working in fancy labs and chat about interesting topics, whereas I am making another 100 kg batch of Sauerkraut.

Would it feel like I should have done it and caved in for the safe option? \nOr would I be happy to have a job that uses my expertise well? A team that is friendly and works together, a good work environment, and products that I like? And that I don't have to deal with all the parts of running a business that I know I wouldn't enjoy. Now I can really focus on being a researcher again.\nWhat is the worst that could happen? We move to Helsingborg and don't like it as much as Gothenburg. But we can explore new areas and new things. I make a ton of connections at Oatly and with other companies, gain insights into the industry, use my scientific expertise, etc. I have a safe income that I can put towards good things and don't have to worry about anything else than what's going on in the 8 hours of work. During the commute I can read and listen to music, in the evenings I don't have to think or worry about work things. I am excited about being in a lab again, having colleagues, discussing projects, doing good work and feeling like I accomplished something. People are excited when I tell them I work at Oatly. I can still do some Reko ring or small scale production and knowledge sharing, if that's something I want to keep up. \n\nIdeal situation: \nWe find a nice apartment in Helsingborg that allows me to have a relatively short commute. I arrange for working from home 2 days a week. Or we even stay mainly in GBG and I work in the lab Mon-Wed and come home Thu-Son. We still see our friends occasionally, but we also make new nice friends. It's exciting to see new places and we take the ferry and the trains all over the place. At work I feel at home in the lab and I like the planning and setting up experiments. The work is a bit unstructured but allows for own planning and direction, and the team leader is very open to input. I am doing exciting things and can look into different areas that I think are interesting. Oatly has some exciting plans that I can be a part in realising. If I decide to leave in a few years, I have a lot of new experience in the field and am much better set up to consult in the area. \n--\u003e Helsingborg is probably nice, if probably a bit more boring than GBG. But there are better connections to other places. Pay is good and we save money to put into nice holidays. Time management is flexible and I don't feel like I'm slaving my life away. \n\nWorst situation:\nHelsingborg is boring and we don't find new friends. The commute is longer than expected and tedious. Due to Covid, it's hard to find myself part of the team, and the whole situtation is a bit unorganised and chaotic. Nevertheless, pressure to produce results is on, since Oatly is expanding massively. I have to look into a lot of patents and literature stuff and it's super boring. When I'm in the lab, things don't work properly and it's super tedious. The things I should investigate don't really interest me much, like how to make oat milk production 2% faster. Someone else is doing a \"Mycobrewery\" in Gothenburg and I feel like I missed a chance. After half a year I want to quit, but I can't because that would look really bad on my CV. \n--\u003e Not very likely that we absolutely hate it in HB. Also not very likely that I absolutely hate it at Oatly. But of course I have forgotten how annoying it can be to work in the lab, when experiments fail and you don't know why. The feeling of wasting resources for nothing. The feeling of not really contributing much to anything.

Making it from fungi is better than grinding up food, but yeah...\n- Going back to something that was already tricky at Mycorena: collaborating with a papermill that has never seen a microbial process, dealing with dirty and potentially toxic side streams, separating the mycelium and turning it into something appealing for the customer. Then the customer wants HUGE amounts to even run trials.\n- Only runway money for 1.5 years (until end of 2024). \n- Do I actually miss fungi fermentation so much? It's messy, it smells, it gets contaminated. Do I like the idea of a \"fungal future\" more than the actual process?\n- Another start-up. Even though Eric seems more sane than Ram, the fact is that working at start-ups, especially if I'm responsible for the technology to work, is really stressful. I won't have the same \"going home and switching off\" that I have at Oatly now. \n- Having to quit Oatly is stressful - I know that shouldn't keep me from doing it, but it does feel like I'm letting very nice colleagues hanging. \n- Less time for hobbies and \"extracurricular\" things. (Or is it? I will still have weekends and holdidays, right?).\n- Probably less pay (or let's say equal to Oatly). Though I wouldn't accept it if it was considerably lower. But how would I feel as the most highly paid person in the company? Mega pressure to make things work!\n- Is Eric a \"rich kid\" that just wants to have a start-up too?\n- Awkward to work in a similar area as Mycorena again? And potentially be less successful?\n- No more plans for casein production or other precision fermentation - just bulk mycelium for animal feed. \n- Risky to use waste streams - shouldn't the goal (also of the producer) be to reduce them as much as possible. (but that's not as easy as it sounds. Priority for waste-stream producing company is still to make their primary product in the best way). \n- Regret to have given up a very good job at a very nice company. \n- I have not seen anything concrete about Cirkul√§r. No product, no IP, no strain. What's their USP?\n- There have been other companies before that try to make fungal fish feed from lignocellulosic waste. Why is it that they haven't succeeded? Is it because it's just very hard? Or that the time wasn't right? Pekilo was developed in the 70s! Lars' old patents with Rhizomucor were from the 90s! Why have all these processes been put on shelves again?\n- Does it look like I can only ever stay 2-3 years at a company? That I get bored quickly and am not loyal to my employer?\n- I don't really believe in a grand future for this company.\n- Need to set up a lot of things from scratch again - the lab, the processes, the documentation. \n- Working again for a company that \"begs\" more than it gets asked. \n- Fermentation processes run on their own time. I would have to completely set my time to that clock. \n- It's dirty, it's uncomfortable, it's messy, stinky, doesn't work half the time, gets contaminated, maybe toxic, yucky, slimey, spores, etc. \n- Do you remember all the struggles and problems at Mycorena concerning fish feed? It has to be super balanced in nutrients, super cost efficient, deliver in huge quantities, it has to be better than current solutions, it can't vary in quality or composition, it has to be dried and stable. Separating the mycelium from anything fibrous is impossible. The mycelium has to be dried (immensely energy-intensive and tricky) so it doesn't start rotting, then milled finely into a powder or granulate. Fish are picky and the fish feed needs to sink, not float. Sulphur and other toxic compounds in the feed are a no-go. Drying the mycelium makes a miniscule amount out of a quite substantial lump - most of fungi is water. \n\n\n\n### Pros\n- Working with fungi and fermentation again. I like the idea of having that area as \"my\" area and want to part of creating new ways of using fungi (and other microbes). \n- My way in to gain some more working knowledge in the fungi, fermentation and alternative protein field (because it's still the area that I want to pursue in my career).\n- Good to dare something. Oatly is \"too safe\" (is that a bad thing?), all of my colleagues have families. I have the possibility to do something a bit less normcore. \n- Possibility to work on different fungal strains, plan and run experiments, make mutations, collaborate with university? (What's the situation with Yvonne like?)\n- Using waste streams in a good way is important and is something I think should be done. Good market as well - every company wants to use their waste streams in a good way and even pay for it. \n- My prospective role sounds quite appealing: lead a small team, develop the technology, bridge the gap to commercial, dig into the science of it, design experiments, etc. \n- Fungi are cool\n- Even if this doesn't work out great after 1-2 years, I will have gained more skills than I would have developed at Oatly, in an area that I want to develop in. \n- Allows me to strengthen my profile in this field. Even if in 2 years I leave and look for other things, it would have been a good addition to my CV.\n- Possibility of shaping the path of the company. \n- Better position to be included in funding applications (with universities and other companies)?\n- I love digging deep into a subject and then try out things. I want to have a reason to really look into how we can use fungi for all kinds of things and be an expert in it. \n- I can choose to a large degree how much I want to be hands on in the lab, and how much I delegate to the lab engineers. \n- Connections with people in the field, like former Quorn and Enough people, professors, Bor√•s, Rise, Lund university. \n\n\n### Questions\n- What other areas could Cirkul√§r expand into (besides animal feed) - food? Waste stream detoxification?\n- What's the status of mycelium grown on lignocellulosic waste? Is it problematic because of e.g. sulfite compounds --\u003e look into that. Pekilo process, publications, etc. \n- What's the USP? Is it a particularly good strain (proprietary?), or a specific way of running the process? Or is it just that no one else is doing it and they are in that niche?\n- Possibility of working from home?\n- Definitely no weekend work expectation and no problem taking holidays?\n- Can I support the continued exploitation of animals by making more \"sustainable\" food for them? But if it's for pets - we always want pets. We don't want animals killed to feed our pets. \n- Can I support the greenwashing of companies that suddenly have an easy way to get rid of their waste streams? And the greenwashing of companies that now have \"sustainable\" fish feed?\n- Does providing more sustainable fish feed mean that in turn eating farmed fish is more attractive? Do I want to work in cleaning up another industries dirty practices?\n- If I really want to go into fungi fermentation, why don't I look for a job e.g. at Novozymes or some other larger company that has already figured out how to do it properly? Rather than trying to re-invent the wheel, trying to do everything yourself, struggling with basics that are solved problems in the industry. \n\n\n### Other thoughts\n- I will never found my own start-up, so joining one that allows me to experiment around is the closest I would get to that. It does allow for possibilities for experimentation around the core business idea - what else could we use fungi for? \n- What's more important for me: to risk something for maybe more excitement but also more work and engagement. Or to keep a good, stable situation going and enjoying the time and peace of mind I have on the side. - Knowing me, I would go all in and get very stressed when the pressure is high. And the pressure will be high, because in a technology-based start-up, the technology is all there is!\n- What would be a better opportunity to change the Oatly job? What would make me leave the Oatly job? A more exciting company? Something food-related? Something in Gothenburg?\n- If everything goes well with Cirkul√§r, (or even if it doesn't) it will probably mean travelling around a lot to different events, customer meetings, pilot trial visits, site visits, etc. I don't want to need to drive and I don't really want to fly around either. \n\n\n### Pre-mortem\n#### Worst case\nCirkul√§r doesn't really have a functioning technology. One of the two research engineers quits after a few months, the other one is completely overworked. I need to come up with a fungi that works well, but the lab resources are quite tight, we struggle with contamination and having the right conditions for good fermentations. We promise our customers great production rates, but can barely reach them in the lab. The pilot plant in Nym√∂lla is being built and we have to run it several times a month, staying there and going back and forth. It's a struggle without a car and I feel pressured into driving there. The people at the paper mill are not super cooperative, the process doesn't really work. Especially separating the wet biomass, then drying it and We manage to produce a tiny amount for some feeding trials, but it doesn't look like it's a good feed anyway. Fish farmers immediately want volumes we can't dream of delivering. The mood is low and stressful. I feel like a failure and feel immense pressure to deliver. I want to quit but it's an awkard situation after just a relatively short time. I regret leaving Oatly and a nice working environment behind. I haven't had time to do anything outside of work for months. \n\n\n#### Best case\nI have a small and ambitious team. We conduct interesting experiments both by growing different fungi on different waste streams, and also trying to mutate and screen to develop new strains. We have good access to equipment through the university and it's also nice to form new connections and potential collaborations. The pilot trials and Nym√∂lla proceed well, resulting in decent amounts of dried mycelium that performs well in fish feeding trials at SLU. Fish farmers are interested and are happy to receive small quantities to test. After successful tests, they want to co-fund larger production places to upscale the technology and produce more mycelium in various production places all over Sweden, as well as outside of Sweden. Me and the team travel to these different places to set up the experiments, hire and train new people. We produce more and more fish feed that replaces fish meal and allows for fish farming without fishing the oceans empty. After a few years at Cirkul√§r I have gained a lot of experience and connections in the fungi and fermentation fields and look for a new position at a food-focused company, as well as a guest professor or part-time position at a university. \n\n\n\n\n## Oatly\n\n\n\n### Cons\n- The redundancy made me really feel that employees are expendable. Not a nice feeling. \n- Some clouds on the horizon: mega focus on profitability (but does that really impact my work so much?), maybe another \"restructuring\" in the future\n- Many work tasks that are not really my area (lab planning, factory trials, endless B12) - I was hired for enzyme technology work. Not very scientific questions that I can dig into - either no time or not the priority. (or am I expecting too much? It's not university)\n- Probably the last chance to join Cirkul√§r - (when) will there be another opportunity for me to join a fungal/fermentation company? My skills are not getting any better at Oatly, and the time that I can still claim some credibility from my Mycorena or university times are also fading. \n- No university connections (at least for me). \n- I feel like I'm still in tier 2 of our scientific team. There are people involved in university research and patent applications, and in more business-critical projects (but would I want that?). \n- I don't really get any connections outside of the company. Hard to build a network that might help me later on. Hard to get connections to university researchers. \n- A lot of nutrition focus, which is not my primary interest (and also annoyingly controversial).\n\n\n\n\n### Pros\n- I still consider it a very nice working environment. There are so many nice things established: the culture, the striving for sustainability that's embedded in every decision, a true feeling of caring for employees.\n- Nice to work for Oatly. People know it and like it. I LOVE the products and am proud to work there. \n- Good boss. Karin is not super proactive, but she listens and never puts pressure on me. Understanding, supportive, calm. \n- It's nice to have varied work and learn new things - which I still constantly do. Maybe not in areas that I would necessarily choose (e.g. how to run a factory trial), but still useful. And I can't complain that my work is too repetitive - there is still a lot of variation in the tasks that I do. \n- Good pay, good holidays, good work hours, good colleagues. Nothing really to complain about. A job that I can keep for a long time and have enough time and headspace on the side for a lot of my other interests.\n- I like it when things are set up nicely, and when there are competent people doing their part. That's very much the case at Oatly. It's nice when things are in place, when not everything has to be done by yourself, when you can ask for help or refer tasks to people. \n- Nice to work with food - everyone can relate to it and has positive connections with it. \n- Good to have skillful coworkers with a lot of experience. I don't have to look for those people first, I can just write them an email and ask. \n- I am cared for as an employee: I get a laptop, a phone, a screen, headphones, fika, friskv√•rdsbidrag, etc. Would I have to use my own laptop and phone at Cirkul√§r?\n- I am quite lucky in that I don't need to have a car, it's possible to commute to work, I don't have to travel much for work. \n\n\n### Other thoughts\n- My future work timeline for Oatly right now looks like: \n\t- Gurt factory trials - somewhat exciting but also repetitive\n\t- More gurt development - could be fun, especially if it's more like probiotic or high fibre gurt, and not just high protein \n\t- Probably some more B12 work - yaaawn\n\t- High fiber + enzymations - that's nice. I can use my enzyme knowledge, do some lab work, refresh my plant cell wall knowledge, discuss with Fran and run some experiments.\n- Other options, beside Oatly _or_ Cirkul√§r: Find a different job in an area I like, use my free time to develop those skills, keep up to date with research I want to move into. \n- I like to have a thing that's mine. I want to specialise a bit more than doing this and that.\n- What am I more passionate about: Working on sustainable food or working on using fungi to produce all kinds of things? Fungi are a bit hyped right now, and they are not the perfect solution for everything. Sustainable food production is definitely one of the most important things to work on.\n- I could really intensify my private interest into fungi again. I don't need to work in a field that I'm passionate about, I can also be knowledgable about it and experiment with it in private. Of course there are some things that are not possible, like a proper lab setting and bioreactors, truly sterile conditions, ordering certain chemicals and strains, etc. But sometimes it's good to not make an interest into a job. \n\n\n### Pre-mortem\n#### Worst case\nI stay at Oatly and the next year is a bit of a slog. \n\n\n## Different Silfa's future scenarios\n\n### Enzyme and food tech\nI stay at Oatly for some time longer. Skills I develop further are in areas of enzyme applications, food production, nutrition, fibres, probiotics, cereals. I continue to work for bringing milk alternatives to more people. The new research centre in Lund is nice to work in. I also spend office days partly in the Malm√∂ office and enjoy a nice walk home after work. I travel a few times to other production places or suppliers, have external collaborations. I have quite a lot of free time where I develop other skills, am active in local organisations, ferment on the side, volunteer, join a urban gardening community. After a few more years at Oatly I look for a job in the enzyme industry (Novozymes), a starter culture company (Chr. Hansen), another food producer (maybe another alternative dairy company) or a precision fermentation company (Remilk). \n\n\n### Fungi and resource management\nI start at Cirkul√§r. Skills I develop further are fungi fermentation in larger scale, screening, mutagenesis, genome editing, waste/resource management, mycology. I work on developing fungi fermentation further, make use of unused resource streams in different industries and run feeding trials on fish in collaboration with universities and fish farmers. I travel quite a lot to different potential customers, collaborators, visiting sites, checking pilot runs, etc. My work is very varied and exciting, high energy and takes up most of my brain space. The team is young and excited. After a few years at Cirkul√§r I look for a job in another fermentation company, either one that makes fungi mycelium for food (Quorn, Enough), a precision fermentation company or continue my work along the resource management path to work on circularity and reducing side streams going to waste. A part-time position at university allows me to be involved in new research projects. My skills are also in demand for various advisory positions and consultancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## State the facts\n\n- Fish feed is not what I want to be working on - if that's the only or main product for now.\n- What other direction would be appealing?\n\t- Food - not really, don't want to be in competition with Mycorena.\n\t- Pet food\n\t- Resource use \n- Start ups eat your life - I don't mind if my own research eats my life, but not someone else's thing.\n- \n\n\n\n\n## Email\n\nHi Eric,\n\nGreat to hear about the prospective collaborations with Ian and Rob. I'm sure they will be great assets to Cirkul√§r.\n\nAnd thanks again for the time you spent the other day to explore whether there would be a role for me in your team. After having reflected at length over the weekend I have come to the conclusion that it wouldn't be the right fit for me at this time. Working at Cirkul√§r would offer me the opportunity to get more into fungal research again and help grow the technological part of the team, both of which I would be excited about. But the company's current product direction does not really align with where I want to put my efforts right now, and so it's with reluctance that I will have to decline your kind offer of coming in next Tuesday for the assessment day.\n\nI greatly appreciate the time you've spent so far on our conversations, and I'm really excited to see where you take the company in the future. I will be following your journey with great interest, and wish you success with the next steps.\n\nLet's stay in touch,\n\nSilvia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Mycobrewery/Admin":{"title":"Admin","content":"\n# List of possible production places\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNnhjGcbgLl4KJmuNIArzHYkE35xw-TksIomSA4Z6BM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNnhjGcbgLl4KJmuNIArzHYkE35xw-TksIomSA4Z6BM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Setting up a business\n\nStartm√∂te i grupp Nyf√∂retagarCentrum: **17-09-2020, 17:00-19:00**, Erik Dahlensgatan 3\n\nInnovation \u0026 business center, G√∂teborg Stad: **23-09-2020, 13:00-14:00**, Caglar √ñnal\n\nR√•dgivning Aff√§rsutveckling: Yesbox (Gamlestaden): **24-09-2020, 8:30-9:30**, Drivhuset, Victoria Ahl√©n\n\nQuestions:\n\n-   Could two freelancers collaborate for a common business?\n-   Can I have a protected name for the business as freelancer?\n-   What's the advantage of being part of a egenanst√§llnings f√∂retag?

Then build on this brand for more things.\n-   Starting off in an already food-grade place is good. A lot of craft breweries have some capacity that they might be happy to rent out. Vega has a nice kitchen that they currently use only for Fridays and Saturdays. `‚Äî\u003e contact Magus, maybe there might be even some collaboration possible? Smoked tempeh?They smoke a lot of things themselves.`\n-   Yes Box in Gamledstaden is good for pre-info about starting business. He'll send me more info about which agencies were useful and which ones not so much.\n-   Handelsbolag is easier to start up, no initial money needed.\n-   Building a space/hub for innovative food and sustainability-related products is good for companies that want to develop something ‚Äî\u003e collaborations, consultancies, etc. At the same time you can make a name for yourself in terms of being the expert and use that for more consultancy work. There are similar projects in e.g. London [Greenla](https://www.greenlab.org/)b, who provide an experimental space/open lab and subscriptions.\n-   Making money with courses is possible, but Gothenburg is not super big, you might run out of people. However, hen nights and company events are always something that's wanted. Basic Theory Ferments: woman won previously the Scottish Beer Brewing award, but then went back to her home in the Netherlands and is now making her own [fermenting everything business](https://www.basictheoryferments.nl/).\n\n**Ram, 01-09-2020**\n\n-   Ring√∂n will be empty from Nov2020 onwards, but they have to keep the lease until 2023. They were thinking about doing a fermentation academy.\n-   He was quite enthusiastic about the concept of my \"fermentation hub\", even (or also because) it's not targeted on profit and scale-up, but more on innovation and community. He suggested renting Ring√∂n from Mycorena and starting the fermentation hub as a collaboration or spin-out from Mycorena, with the backing of Mycorena, but still independently. In that way the premises could be used for courses, open lab, events, food production, trials, etc. The connection with Mycorena could stay purely support focussed with the benefit of maybe taking good people to be employed at Mycorena or using the fermentation hub for grant applications with mutual benefits. He suggested 2-3 months rent free, then also 5-6 months rent free.\n-   Pros: Established facility (not perfect, but working and food grade), good size, good location, backing from Mycorena gives it a good boost, could leave some equipment, keep network, quicker start-off, input from other people, easier possibility of collaborating, more reach, looks better for both sides if the CTO starts something up like that?\n-   Cons: Trusting Ram, possibly not being completely independent (needs a strong contract!), more expensive than I would like in the beginning, too big, many problems with the place, not really mine,\n-   Find out and brain-storm: What are the regulations regarding food-grade, is it only for Mycorena or for another company coming after? What is really bad with the place that would be a deal breaker? What other things would be deal breakers? What would have to be completely certain in the contract to avoid future problems (e.g. independent from Mycorena, not restriction on what we produce and who we collaborate with (no exclusivity), rental agreement with notice period).\n-   Make: Short presentation about the idea and how it could run, for both Ram + the team, but also outside people. Make a more formal list of pros, cons, concerns and requirements for moving into the Mycorena Ring√∂n space. Make a list of people to talk to for inital funding and help and contact them (Yesbox, Innovation office, GU Ventures, G√∂teborg Stad, etc.).\n\n**Ram+Ebba, 11-09-2020**\n\n-   They would like to do something with the place. Ram already thinks way ahead with having shares in my company, having people pay subscriptions etc. Ebba understands that I want to stay independent.\n-   They are up for trying something, but emphasise that I would have to be the project leader and can in return e.g. get a really cheap rate (2000 SEK/month) for using the place.\n-   Current rent: 17 000 SEK per month. So that's what they want to break even with (or let's say 20 000 SEK/month).\n-   In a subscription model, I could be the first of the subscribers with quite a low rate, and then get comission for getting in new customers.\n-   Restrictions: no direct competition to Mycorena, i.e. no liquid fermentation for fungi as an ingredient. Tempeh and such things are fine. `‚Äî\u003e However, could direct competition not be good for Mycorena? Then you know first hand what is being done and you have the first chance to get in on it.`\n-   Things to think about: What would have to be adapted and refurbished to make it attractive for people? What is the demand for people to rent such a space? What could we offer? How much work and money would it take to refurbish Ring√∂n to a certain standard? Who are the customers? Who would pay a subscription for such a space? If you want to make a product, why not just rent a kitchen? Is there actually a market?\n-   `We seem to have a shared vision, which is good, but we need to know more to make it work. Mostly about actual demand and how it could work. I am willing to put some work into it, but I don't want to build up and manage a fermentation hub for Mycorena, only so they don't have to pay the rent and have a good story for their CTO leaving.`\n-   To make it a big thing, we would need to have someone like G√∂teborg Stad, VGR, Livsmedelsacceleratorn, etc. on board and for that we need to know the demand `‚Äî\u003e ask Fredrik about that.`\n\n**Matt, 13-09-2020**\n\n-   VERY positive towards the idea, he thinks well-made craft tempeh would definitely sell to various high-end restaurants (and other places) in Gothenburg.\n-   I should make a list of all possible restaurants (e.g. Familjen, Pigalle-Family, etc.) and he can put me in contact with some people he knows. There is someone called Bj√∂rn that he mentions has a food truck and is often at Lindholmen streetfood market and is very nice.\n-   To sell it: just call up or email a restaurant and ask for a short meeting with the head chef. Then bring some tasty samples, best is one fairly plain and one nicely prepared (e.g. in a Banh mi with some nice lemon mayonnaise and good bread, etc.) so they see what it can taste like.\n-   Ring√∂n seems too big for a start and distracting from the idea of making tempeh. I shouldn't run a fermentation hub for Mycorena when I actually want to start small. Don't let yourself get talked into something, and be careful about Ram.\n-   The most important: **make fucking great tempeh**. Figure out some recipes.\n-   Getting a small place is easy. All I need is a kitchen and a good storage room. For incubation, I can buy a holding closet for kitchens that can keep a certain temperature (and often also certain humidity). I could even have small courses already in a small space and store people's ferments in some shelves. Matt used to rent kitchen space at night in a restaurant to try out things, so chefs are often up for that as well (if I just need space to prepare food).\n-   For selling to individuals, make it as easy as possible. People can't cook. Marinate it and sell them only marinated, flavoured stuff, so they can't do anything wrong.\n-   `Start experimenting more with unusual tempeh recipes, esp. including Swedish grains and legumes. Get some miso going.`\n-   In the summer, just rent a food truck and serve some things.\n-   Recipe collaborations with restaurant, e.g. exclusive tempeh for a certain restaurants that I develop together with the chef. Can only be sold in this one restaurant then.\n-   In a restaurant, ingredients shouldn't cost more than 25% of the dish. Of that 25%, 2/3 are for the protein, because carbs and veggies cost nothing. Serving sizes for meat are usually 150-200 g. Restaurants often buy from special shops if they actually have better quality. Small batches are fine if the quality is top notch (e.g. cheese from a very small supplier, special organic ingredients from Gr√∂na Boden).\n-   Have a plan for when a batch goes wrong!! You can't let a restaurant down with 20 portions for the weekend! `‚Äî\u003e Always have some frozen options going.`\n-   How long does it keep for? If for 1 week, make sure it keeps for 3 (because restaurants will use it for 3 weeks if you tell them it lasts for 1). So make sure you know what happens with the product during storage. `‚Äî\u003e Figure out shelf life!`\n-   Map the flavours of the different tempehs to have something to present to chefs, they love these kinds of things. Pairings, suggestions of applications, etc.\n\n**Bo Norrman, 17-09-2020**\n\n**Fredrik Schubert (RISE), 21-09-2020**\n\nQ: Test-kitchen at RISE, what's the demand? What do people need? Do you think there is a demand for a fermentation space? How did it go with your kombucha production, did you have a possibility of making it somewhere? Are there places out there? If yes, what do they offer and how much do they cost? Is there a demand at RISE? Did you talk to anyone at RISE that thought it was a good idea? Who to talk to next? Someone at Livsmedelsacceleratorn maybe?\n\n-   He is quite pessimistic about the \"fermentation hub\" idea working well. It's just too much investment into equipment and doing up a place to make it attractive for customers. And then you have he problem of _finding_ customers and keeping it running. It's very hard to find customers! Especially hard if you don't have a good network yet. If someone like RISE made offered a fermentation facility instead, it would be much more of a clear way for customers, i.e. companies, to come to such a place and ask for test runs, use it as a test-bed, etc.\n-   RISE Forum is a test bed that has various specialisations, e.g. a charcuterie with 10 smokers, a bakery, etc. but currently it's not used very much and only from internal users. 10-15 years ago it was always completely booked, but the researchers left for industry and it was never really taken up again after that. There are plans for reviving it, however, and even of including a fermentation facility. With or without me they will be going to do something there `‚Äî\u003e Fredrik will put me in contact with Klara B√•√•th (his boss) who is very nice and is the best person to talk about my ideas of the fermentation hub. Maybe there are some involvement possibilities in the future?`\n-   He currently has a customer who are struggling with making a consistent batch of organic apple cider vinegar. They can't figure out what's wrong, but they also don't really have the knowledge or the equipment. For someone like that such a facility would be great. But they don't have any money to do anything.\n-   Intel: the government is giving RISE 350 Mio SEK in the next years to build up a sustainable biogas production in Uppsala. Maybe something for me in the future?\n-   Regarding Fredrik's kombucha business: it was super hard to find customers, they struggled a lot. Despite getting good feedback that their kombucha tasted really good. They also had a much too expensive place (milj√∂f√∂rvaltningen checked and everything). They produced up to 200 L a week in mostly 25 L barrels and everything really low-tech and manual. They also did bottling themselves.\n-   He can connect me with a RISE tempeh specialist in Uppsala. Maybe she has some ideas for something?\n-   Conclusion: Negative about fermentation hub idea, but positive about that fermentation facilities are needed in the future and that there is growing demand for it. In his opinion, it would be best to have it integrated in RISE and I could possibly be involved in that in some way.","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Mycobrewery/Food-production-requirements":{"title":"Food production requirements","content":"\nInformation from [](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises)[https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises)\n\nBefore starting, you need to **register your business** with the local authorities, mostly Milj√∂- och h√§lsoskyddsn√§mnden in your kommun (most caf√©s, restaurants, shops, etc., some exceptions, e.g. if you only occasionally sell at local markets). Usually Livsmedelsverket controls food productions, e.g. meat, fish. Food businesses that prim√§rproduktion (vegetables, bees) need approval from the l√§nsstyrelse. You have to pay the fees for registrations and inspections. You have to tell the responsible authorities if you change or stop your operations.\n\nThe company needs to have **suitable equipment, facilities and a system for own checks**. Everyone handling food along the whole production chain needs to be aware of hygiene risks and own control systems need to be in place.\n\nThe production facility needs to be approved by Livsmedelsverket if it delivers to other food producers. What is needed to register for approval? Name and address, org number or personnummer, location of production, description of production. The responsible authorities have forms for registration. A registration is not an approval yet! A decision about the registration will be reached in 2 weeks. Production can be started 2 weeks after a complete registration has been sent in to Livsmedelsverket. After that, an appointment for surveying will be made (which costs), and after that a yearly fee is required.\n\nOther requirements have to be fulfilled as well, e.g. regarding Skatteverket, Bolagsverket, soph√§mtning, k√§llsortering, farligt avfall, etc.\n\nFood production in your own kitchen is allowed if it fulfills the requirements for hygienic food production. You have to contact milj√∂kontoret in your kommun and they will say if you can register your food production. The main requirements are that the food is produced in a safe way and that the person producing the food has the right knowledge, routines in place that prevent risks and does regular self controls.\n\nRules for labelling of food products: [](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/0905.html)[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/0905.html](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/0905.html)\n\nEU Lebensmittelrecht: [](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002R0178-20180701\u0026qid=1562918485615\u0026from=SV)[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002R0178-20180701\u0026qid=1562918485615\u0026from=SV](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002R0178-20180701\u0026qid=1562918485615\u0026from=SV)\n\n**HACCP for small-scale breweries in Sweden**: [](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/produktion-handel-kontroll/branschriktlinjer/industry-guidelines-for-brewers.pdf)[https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/produktion-handel-kontroll/branschriktlinjer/industry-guidelines-for-brewers.pdf](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/produktion-handel-kontroll/branschriktlinjer/industry-guidelines-for-brewers.pdf)\n\n**Check food recalls in the EU**: [](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=searchForm#)[https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=searchForm#](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=searchForm#) (nothing found with subject \"Tempeh\") [](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en)[https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en)\n\n## Food Safety regarding tempeh\n\n[](http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206)[http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206](http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206): Basically, keep the beans below pH 4.3 and oxygen at all times, make sure the Rhizopus outcompetes quickly.

The main focus will be food and beverage production, courses, education and knowledge creation, as well as in the further future a test-bed for the development of home fermentation kits.\n\nBy building up The Mycobrewery, we will gain knowledge about growing and propagating mushrooms and fungi, get a network of customers, be involved in different projects, develop the business further and spread out into other areas.\n\nThe Mushroom Brewery should have a focus on sustainable growth, sustainable production, community, quality and scientific expertise. It should not be run as a \"DIY farm\", but rather as a more sophisticated, cool and futuristic, but still approachable and friendly, knowledge and production centre. Research can and should be a part of the concept, where new applications of fungi are tested and further developed, ideally in collaboration with a university or company.\n\n\n# Concept 1: Mushroom farm, expanding into other businesses, focused on selling products\n\n## What are the products and the necessary steps?\n\n### Step 1\n\nSmall-scale mushroom farming for local restaurants and private customers. Small-scale tempeh production (different grains, different pulses, marinated) for local restaurants and customers.\n\nInvestigate interest (mostly from restaurants around), scout for places (how big, how central, minimum requirements), talk to city people, look for funding opportunities, talk to people who do similar things (aquaculture guy, city farming people, microbrewery people, mushroom farms, tempeh producers)\n\n### Step 2\n\nLarger-scale mushroom farming (more volume, more variety) for local restaurants, private customers and selected supermarkets. Courses and education for people interested in mushroom growing.\n\n### Step 3\n\nAddition of more fungi- and fermentation-related activities, e.g. kombucha, \"Quorn\", beer, miso. Expansion of courses and education. Development of mushroom growing and different fermentation kits and equipment for online and at-site sales.\n\n### Step 4\n\nAddition of sales of developed and custom-made home bioreactors and other specialised fermentation equipment.\n\n### Additional possibilities\n\nArt projects, exhibitions, university collaborations, consultancy for companies, online courses, Youtube videos, recipes, product development, city development collaborations, resource use, newsletter, book, talks, podcast, open lab, etc.\n\n\n## Who are customers and who can be involved?\n\n-   Local restaurants (mainly New Nordic cuisine, vegetarian/vegan places, independent caf√© and caterers)\n-   Individual customers that buy the products\n-   Individuals interested in growing mushrooms, brewing beer, fermentation, mycology, scientific background of fungi and fermentation, that attend the courses\n-   \"Event\"-searching people and companies that attend the courses\n-   (Food producing) companies that need some ideas, innovation or testing for either making new products, get inspiration, get knowledge or get someone try out something with their products. Also possible with their side streams, to make it into a new product.\n\n\n\n# Concept 2: Fermentation hub with innovation, education and production\n\nIn contrast to concept 1, this concept is from the start a bit more focused on the \"innovation hub\" aspect. This means acting primarily as a space for people who are interested in trying out and making products with fermentation. Offering a food-grade production place for making food, experimenting and testing.\n\n## What are the products and the necessary steps?\n\n### Step 1\n\nSetting up a small-scale tempeh production that sells to local caf√©s and restaurants. Trying out different other fermentation options (kimchi, kombucha) and getting the minimum machinery for small-scale production.\n\n### Step 2\n\nSetting up courses and workshops for people interested in trying out fermentation. Coming up with innovative concepts that people can taste and try.\n\nLittle shop with all necessary equipment to start your own fermentations at home. Own-branded items (see \"Branding\" section below), books, etc.\n\n### Step 3\n\nOffering a subscription-based production or lab space where people interested in developing their own idea can come, verify it and even produce it. This would go hand-in-hand with running the workshops on the side and own production of products.\n\nPossibility of hosting events for groups and companies, inviting a chef for catering, a test bed for new products for other food-producing companies (e.g. Mycorena), verifying small batches of products, local production.\n\nApplying for funding for developing the concept further, collaborating with other food producers, \"waste\" producers, etc.\n\n# Branding\n\nShould be between organic and scientific. Not too sterile and corporate, but also not full on instagram vegan. Something like [Basic Theory Ferments](https://www.basictheoryferments.nl/) strikes a nice balance.\n\nSimple colour schemes, nice simple logo(s).\n\nNice branding concept, example from Food \u0026 Beyond: [](https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699)[https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699](https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699)\n\nOffer kits and custom equipment with the branding on it, e.g. the right size boxes for incubation chambers with the right number of holes in it, little packages of tempeh starter with the logo on it, marinade mixes, delux kits including an immersion cooker, nice jars with a discreet logo, little mushroom merch, etc.\n\nNice little sales area with books, products and equipment.\n\nNicely designed course material with logo and good instructions + photos.\n\nGood high quality photos of everything.\n\n# What's missing? Ideas\n\nOrganically produced starter cultures for Rhizopus (‚Äî\u003e e.g. B√§rta write on their website that they can't get hold of them and that they buy it from Belgium right now).\n\nNo one is making natto ‚Äî\u003e tasting sessions? Fermentations levels - beginners, intermedia, expert\n\nTempeh tasting map to show what the different flavours and characteristics are\n\nFermentation subscription: get a new fermented product every month\n\nTempeh snacks, tempeh chips, tempeh √∂lkorv, miso sweets, sweet tempeh, tempeh (fish) fingers, miso marinades (for tempeh)\n\nOffer tempeh and miso kits and starter cultures in own branded packages (with own label etc.) ‚Äî\u003e check what's important to be able to re-sell other people's stuff (e.g. tempeh starter culture from Indonesia)\n\nRecipe package + right ingredients for small caf√©s (eg marinated tempeh and lemon mayonnaise for banh mi)\n\nCollaborations and trials with waste from local industries: spent grains, coffee grounds, etc for mushroom cultivation and/or tempeh\n\nCollaborations with V√§rt: making fermented products out of their saved foods?\n\nMaking different starter cultures (scoby, sourdough, Rhizopus, vattenkefir).\n\nTry sweet things (for something like Caf√© Alkemisten)\n\nAsk Vega Bryggeri for help with smoking. They say on their website that they smoke everything, so I could probably go in on that.\n\nGothenburg is the beer capital of Sweden, so it should also become in general the fermentation capital of Sweden.\n\nBrand tempeh variants according to Swedish cities? (E.g. the G√∂teborg, the Malm√∂) Or according to other Swedish things. How Swedish should the whole concept be?\n\nCold-attenuate tempeh starter/strain, so I can grow tempeh at room temperature (and sell the proprietary strain).\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.389433147Z","tags":null},"/private/Mycobrewery/Mycoprotein-consultancy":{"title":"Mycoprotein consultancy","content":"\n## Notes for consultancy call\n\n### 1. Consumer pain points\n= unmet needs, wanting to be satisfied. Persistent problems with a product or service that \nConsumer (i.e. person buying mycoprotein products)\n- Unfamiliarity, unusual product\n- Yuck-factor (mould) --\u003e less in people who already consume fermented and mouldy products. Helps to compare yourself to brewing processes, cheese, etc. \n- (Perception of) highly processed food\n- Most important: sensory attributes, i.e. taste and texture\n- Clean label (not too many additives). \n- Nutritional benefits, (perceived) health --\u003e there were some studies on how mycoprotein helps in muscle building and is equal to beef, etc.\n- Safe to eat? Quorn had some problems in the US about gastrointestinal problems. \n- Expect mycoprotein to behave in same way as meat. --\u003e This is more of an issue for people that really look for meat-like behaviour. Too realistic might put another group of customers off.\n- Affordability. Cheap or at least not that much expensive than meat. Affordability, together with tastiness, were the two categories were mycoprotein was ranked lowest in a recent study (2023, Dean) https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14163292. Biggest drivers to try mycoprotein were nutrition, safe to eat, sustainability.\n- In recent paper (Chezan et al., 2022) the overall acceptance was found to be quite low. Likely due to a perceived low appeal and tastiness of fungal protein products. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.106043\n\nCustomer (i.e. company buying mycoprotein as B2B product)\n- Except mycoprotein to behave like meat: taste, texture, processibility.\n- Safe to eat\n- Nutrition\n- Price\n- State that the product comes in: wet (frozen), dried as flour, in chunks, in blocks, etc. Pumpable paste. \n- Purity (how much protein, how much fibre, colour, odour)\n\n\n\n### 2. Biggest challenges/hurdles\nFor mycoprotein producers\n- **Expertise** --\u003e not that many people out there that have experience with cultivating fungi in large scale, especially not for food production.\n- **High investment costs**\n- Small number of **\"allowed\" fungal strains**. Otherwise difficult process to get safety status by FDA or EFSA. \n- Some **pricey substrates** needed, e.g. nitrogen compounds, minerals and vitamins, carbon source --\u003e some could be taken from side streams, but that opens a whole other chapter of challenges (purity and consistency of side stream, composition, appearance in the final product, safe transfer of side stream, dependence on specific supplier, insufficient consumption by fungi, suboptimal consumption by fungi (--\u003e does the cheaper price make up for that?)).\n- **Contamination**: sterile process with high sugar content, nice temperature and neutral pH. This is where a lot of contaminants love to grow. \n- **Consistent production**. Tricky if not all parameters are monitored and balanced in the right way. Depending on cultivation conditions, fungus grows more or less fibrous, produces off-flavours, can produce toxins, etc.\n- Customer and consumer **acceptance**. B2B customers usually want high volumes at a very consistent quality --\u003e can you deliver that? They are used to getting protein concentrate powders with a defined protein content; mycoprotein's strength is not being a powdered ingredient (but maybe they want that?). Consumers (see question 1) might have reservations towards mycoprotein, the health and safety aspects, perceived taste, etc. \n- **Texture** of final product (if fresh): fibres are nice, but can be too much. How to modulate that you get the benefit of fibres, without it tasting like cardboard?\n- Ensuring safety: mycotoxin monitoring.\n- **Downstream processing**: Harvesting (dewatering), heat treatment, post-processing (RNA removal/inactivation), food safety aspects, energy demand of drying. All processing steps influence the texture massively, because the texture is so dependent on the structure of the fungal mycelium, how much water it holds, if the protein is denatured or not, if certain ions are present in the cultivation liquid, etc.\n- Storage: Freeze or dry --\u003e both energy intense and result in very different products. What is more appealing to customers (B2C or B2B)?\n- Labelling: just mycoprotein, brand name, or species name?\n\n\n### 3. Innovation potential for mycoprotein\n- **Cheaper, healthier and tastier than meat.** Easy ;) \n- Focusing on fibre aspect of mycoprotein --\u003e something that is completely lacking in meat and that could give an edge. \n- Finding a diversity of fungi species that can be included in the portfolio that serve different aspects: e.g. different tastes and textures, suitable for different applications, bioactive compounds, different amino acid profiles, etc. Though finding unique fungi with different tastes and textures is VERY tricky. A lot can be done with varying culture conditions and substrates. \n- Creating a trustable brand that people associate with a tasty product. \n- Finding consumer paint points in current plant-based meat options and improving them: \n- To make the production process cheaper and more robust, use learnings from other fermentation processes: provide conditions that only favour your organism of interest: high temperature, low or high pH, certain substrates, producing inhibiting substances, co-cultivation with a selective organism. \n- Improvements on bioreactor design --\u003e useful to be in collaboration with a university. Air intake is very important, how can that be improved in a clever way?\n\n\n### 4. Possible applications and future applications\n- Fresh products are the obvious strength of mycoprotein, but I think there's a huge possibility for a protein concentrate that is functional (foamable, stable in emulsion, can be fermented), has a neutral colour and no off-taste. Currently, every plant protein has some big disadvantages, and it's mostly that there is an unpleasant plant/grassy/beany note that is hard to cover up. \n- Incorporating fat into the mix\n\n\n\n### 5. CAPEX (rough/ballpark)\n_Prices are 2021 levels, so probably increased._\nPrices depend very much on grade of equipment (lab, food-grade, pharmaceutical, brewery) and even grade of steel. There can be huge differences. \n\nCheapest: Buy and adapt a brewery fermentor from abroad (Czechia, China), get it delivered. Or get old pharma equipment and adapt. \n\nIf custom-made (in Switzerland): \n- 500 L bioreactor with all additions: 4 mio SEK\n\nIf custom-made (in Sweden):\n- 100 L bioreactor: 500 000 SEK\n- 1000 L bioreactor: 750 000 SEK\n- 10 000 L bioreactor: 1.8 mio SEK\n- Stirrers, filter system, thermo system, pH system, oxygen system, foam control: about 100 000 SEK each\nSo for a whole line from seed reactor to 10 m3 with installation and all controls: 5-7 mio SEK. \n![](fungi/LARS%20TS%20cost%20calc%20may2020.pdf)\n\n### 6. Role for B2B ingredient supplier\n\n\n\n### 7.

Consumer pain points\n= unmet needs, wanting to be satisfied. Persistent problems with a product or service that \nConsumer (i.e. person buying mycoprotein products)\n- Unfamiliarity, unusual product\n- Yuck-factor (mould) --\u003e less in people who already consume fermented and mouldy products. Helps to compare yourself to brewing processes, cheese, etc. \n- (Perception of) highly processed food\n- Most important: sensory attributes, i.e. taste and texture\n- Clean label (not too many additives). \n- Nutritional benefits, (perceived) health --\u003e there were some studies on how mycoprotein helps in muscle building and is equal to beef, etc.\n- Safe to eat? Quorn had some problems in the US about gastrointestinal problems. \n- Expect mycoprotein to behave in same way as meat. --\u003e This is more of an issue for people that really look for meat-like behaviour. Too realistic might put another group of customers off.\n- Affordability. Cheap or at least not that much expensive than meat. Affordability, together with tastiness, were the two categories were mycoprotein was ranked lowest in a recent study (2023, Dean) https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14163292. Biggest drivers to try mycoprotein were nutrition, safe to eat, sustainability.\n- In recent paper (Chezan et al., 2022) the overall acceptance was found to be quite low. Likely due to a perceived low appeal and tastiness of fungal protein products. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.106043\n\nCustomer (i.e. company buying mycoprotein as B2B product)\n- Except mycoprotein to behave like meat: taste, texture, processibility.\n- Safe to eat\n- Nutrition\n- Price\n- State that the product comes in: wet (frozen), dried as flour, in chunks, in blocks, etc. Pumpable paste. \n- Purity (how much protein, how much fibre, colour, odour)\n\n\n\n### 2. Biggest challenges/hurdles\nFor mycoprotein producers\n- **Expertise** --\u003e not that many people out there that have experience with cultivating fungi in large scale, especially not for food production.\n- **High investment costs**\n- Small number of **\"allowed\" fungal strains**. Otherwise difficult process to get safety status by FDA or EFSA. \n- Some **pricey substrates** needed, e.g. nitrogen compounds, minerals and vitamins, carbon source --\u003e some could be taken from side streams, but that opens a whole other chapter of challenges (purity and consistency of side stream, composition, appearance in the final product, safe transfer of side stream, dependence on specific supplier, insufficient consumption by fungi, suboptimal consumption by fungi (--\u003e does the cheaper price make up for that?)).\n- **Contamination**: sterile process with high sugar content, nice temperature and neutral pH. This is where a lot of contaminants love to grow. \n- **Consistent production**. Tricky if not all parameters are monitored and balanced in the right way. Depending on cultivation conditions, fungus grows more or less fibrous, produces off-flavours, can produce toxins, etc.\n- Customer and consumer **acceptance**. B2B customers usually want high volumes at a very consistent quality --\u003e can you deliver that? They are used to getting protein concentrate powders with a defined protein content; mycoprotein's strength is not being a powdered ingredient (but maybe they want that?). Consumers (see question 1) might have reservations towards mycoprotein, the health and safety aspects, perceived taste, etc. \n- **Texture** of final product (if fresh): fibres are nice, but can be too much. How to modulate that you get the benefit of fibres, without it tasting like cardboard?\n- Ensuring safety: mycotoxin monitoring.\n- **Downstream processing**: Harvesting (dewatering), heat treatment, post-processing (RNA removal/inactivation), food safety aspects, energy demand of drying. All processing steps influence the texture massively, because the texture is so dependent on the structure of the fungal mycelium, how much water it holds, if the protein is denatured or not, if certain ions are present in the cultivation liquid, etc.\n- Storage: Freeze or dry --\u003e both energy intense and result in very different products. What is more appealing to customers (B2C or B2B)?\n- Labelling: just mycoprotein, brand name, or species name?\n\n\n### 3. Innovation potential for mycoprotein\n- **Cheaper, healthier and tastier than meat.** Easy ;) \n- Focusing on fibre aspect of mycoprotein --\u003e something that is completely lacking in meat and that could give an edge. \n- Finding a diversity of fungi species that can be included in the portfolio that serve different aspects: e.g. different tastes and textures, suitable for different applications, bioactive compounds, different amino acid profiles, etc. Though finding unique fungi with different tastes and textures is VERY tricky. A lot can be done with varying culture conditions and substrates. \n- Creating a trustable brand that people associate with a tasty product. \n- Finding consumer paint points in current plant-based meat options and improving them: \n- To make the production process cheaper and more robust, use learnings from other fermentation processes: provide conditions that only favour your organism of interest: high temperature, low or high pH, certain substrates, producing inhibiting substances, co-cultivation with a selective organism. \n- Improvements on bioreactor design --\u003e useful to be in collaboration with a university. Air intake is very important, how can that be improved in a clever way?\n\n\n### 4. Possible applications and future applications\n- Fresh products are the obvious strength of mycoprotein, but I think there's a huge possibility for a protein concentrate that is functional (foamable, stable in emulsion, can be fermented), has a neutral colour and no off-taste. Currently, every plant protein has some big disadvantages, and it's mostly that there is an unpleasant plant/grassy/beany note that is hard to cover up. \n- Incorporating fat into the mix\n\n\n\n### 5. CAPEX (rough/ballpark)\n_Prices are 2021 levels, so probably increased._\nPrices depend very much on grade of equipment (lab, food-grade, pharmaceutical, brewery) and even grade of steel. There can be huge differences. \n\nCheapest: Buy and adapt a brewery fermentor from abroad (Czechia, China), get it delivered. Or get old pharma equipment and adapt. \n\nIf custom-made (in Switzerland): \n- 500 L bioreactor with all additions: 4 mio SEK\n\nIf custom-made (in Sweden):\n- 100 L bioreactor: 500 000 SEK\n- 1000 L bioreactor: 750 000 SEK\n- 10 000 L bioreactor: 1.8 mio SEK\n- Stirrers, filter system, thermo system, pH system, oxygen system, foam control: about 100 000 SEK each\nSo for a whole line from seed reactor to 10 m3 with installation and all controls: 5-7 mio SEK. \n![](fungi/LARS%20TS%20cost%20calc%20may2020.pdf)\n\n### 6.

Calm post-Christmas mood. A model train going around the Christmas tree in the hotel lobby. The onsen was amazing and the massage chairs ate our legs. Fell asleep in the chill-out hammocks. Bought fateful non-alcoholic berry wine in the local Systembolaget. Early on New Year's Eve Opa died. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20191229_153025.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20191229_150746.jpg]]\n\n### January 2020:\nDuncan spent the early hours of 2020 on the toilet because of the Varberg berry wine. \nSome days I want to forget. Then short Austria trip for Opa's funeral (in hindsight the last flight for a long time).\nNot too exciting Gothenburg Film Festival this year, we saw Inland (woman moving to the Swedish North), Little Joe (unemotional plant sci-fi), Meanwhile on Earth (Sk√•nskt funeral industry), VHYes (fake 80ies tapes), When Tomatoes Met Wagner (farmers in Greece). \nBooked all the flights and exciting hotels for our Belize trip in June.\nWe also got our nice teal-coloured reading chair delivered, the most expensive piece of furniture I've ever owned. And one early, frosty morning we started walking Gotaleden, from Kungsportsplatsen all the way to Partille, with the intention to make this our year of walking \"all of Gotaleden\". Didn't exactly turn out this way.\nFirst Swedish Corona case on the 31st. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200107_151243.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200125_105134.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200129_192338.jpg]]\n\n\n### February 2020: \nFabian visited and Duncan went to several museums with him. I sewed a thobe for Duncan and a loungewear set for myself. At Mycorena, we fixed up and started producing the first big batches with the 300L fermenter. So many problems with the steam generator. \nSo many sleepless nights because of Shouty Man. He would often stand on the balcony and spit and shout and curse and throw things. \nFinally I decided to buy a year ticket for V√§sttrafik. That was a bad decision in hindsight, wasn't it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200206_175022.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200212_160143.jpg]]\n\n### March 2020:\nCorona still didn't seem to be such a problem, so we booked an introductory diving lesson in preparation for Belize. The pool was very deep and somewhere in Fr√∂lunda. I got extremely cold after a while and didn't enjoy the diving that much. Nice French man gave us a lift back to Kville. Then we walked all the way to Ring√∂n to check on the fermentations, then had late night McDonalds.  \nShouty Man finally moved out. \nHad my last official day at Chalmers on the 23rd. \nSewed myself a dress with lightning bolts on.\nWhen I went to Stockholm to select lab equipment for Mycorena, the woman at SOBI  didn't want to shake hands. I remember finding it a bit exaggerated. \nAt the end of the month, Duncan decided to get a Corona haircut and I shaved his hair. The shortest he'd had it since his birth. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200310_071237 1.jpg]]\n![[ IMG_20200327 1.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200301_213104 1.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200330_200340.jpg]]\n\n### April 2020:\nBeautiful weather for most of the time. We took a lot of walks to Svarta Mossen, Puffball Hill and Saltholmen. We bought an Axidraw pen plotter and started coding more generative art pieces to plot and put on Youtube and overlay with chillhop music. Plottervision, chillplot and plotspots were born. \nHad to cancel the skiing weekend with Chris \u0026 co to Kvitfjell, since everything started closing down.\nWork at Mycorena got more and more to me. So many (too many) after-work-walks with Duncan were spent on that subject. \nOne afternoon I came home earlier and we had picnic at Frihamnen. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200404_115752__01.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200408_170113.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200420_184753.jpg]]\n\n### May 2020:\nEurovision was cancelled this year. The substitute was a sad show. But some of the entries were bangers. Remember \"Cleopatrrrra\"? \nSome days were already really warm. One day we went for a walk around Eriksberg with Eva and Kennet and Leonet\u0026Bj√∂rnen ice cream. Afterwards I felt guilty when Eva uploaded a tagged photo on Facebook, because the rest of Europe was in strict lockdown. \nAt Mycorena we had a meatball launch in less than 60 days, a \"Virtual Internship\" and got 2.1 Mio EUR in investments. Still got shit from Ram. \nI made a skirt out of fabric that I got from Recreate Design's bankrupcy.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/101334987_10156848907791780_7487211338003906560_o.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200528_201138.jpg]]\n\n### June 2020:\nOn our walks we discovered H√∂k√§lla, a wetland nature reserve near Skogome, and Nuet, a neon-orange wooden tower with a nice view of Gothenburg in the distance. It was an art piece built for the 400 year anniversary of GBG, then almost taken down because of some district re-organisation dispute. \nI quit Mycorena and Ram took my resignation without any discussion. \nI sewed a kimono-style jacket for myself in a pineapple print fabric, and made a little dog pad for Laika. She also got a dog pool for her birthday, that she didn't like at all. Was just standing in the 10 cm high water not knowing what to do. We threw in treats to make her lie down, but that didn't really work and the treats dissolved after a while into a mushy mess. \nThe days got longer and longer, until midsommar was here. We celebrated in a small round in F√§rjen√§sparken. We started quite early, at around 11, and the weather was nice. I picked up some ice-cream from Leonet\u0026Bj√∂rnen at Eriksberg and then had to run all the way back to our picnic place before the ice-cream melted. Pawel brought Pavlova with raspberries. \nWe decided that this year would be the year where we try camping, and we wanted to start somewhere on Hisingen. One morning we took the bikes to explore some good places. All went well until we reached Sk√§ndlaberg, Duncan missed the curbstone, I turned around and saw him fall off the bike and land with head and shoulder on the asphalt. Head was fine, but the shoulder was damaged and one half of his body was pretty scratched up. We took the bus home (the accident happened right at a countryside bus stop) and I went back there later that weekend with Pawel to pick up the bike. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200614_132305.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200612_122040.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200612_213324.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200612_215835.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200619_124605.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200621_103347.jpg]]\n\n\n### July 2020\nFor Duncan's birthday we met up with some friends up on Ramberget and sat on the rocks, drank non-alco beer and ate pink grapefruit drizzle cake. \n8th July was my first day of unemployment. \nJuly was in general quite calm. One day there was a langos truck at Kvilletorget and the queue was wrapping around the block. Not much else exciting happening in summer during a pandemic. We sat on a picnic blanket with David Gilblom and Laika was scared of a giant Bernese Mountaindog puppy, while the queue of langos-hungry people grew and grew.\nOne day we tried to see comet Neowise from Ramberget, but Sweden in July is too bright to see any comet. \nI replayed all of Zelda Breath of the Wild and I never wanted it to end. \nMy garden looked pretty good this year, but all I got in the end were some beans, some peas and a bit of mangold that didn't actually taste that nice. \nBuilding of the new Hisingsbron was proceeding quite quickly and it was fun to watch it take shape. \nOne morning I went on a bike tour up along Bj√∂rlandav√§gen and landed at Kippholmen, a lovely little bay that was completely empty that early in the day. I lay on the warm rocks for a bit and read Reaf Life by Callum Roberts, before cycling back home in time for lunch. I had a vague plan of doing that more often during my unemployment - just take the bike for long-ish bike rides to get some exercise and my head free, but that didn't really happen. But 2020 was the year that I seriously took up biking to go anywhere. Except for very few bus rides, I didn't use public transport the whole year. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200728_173122.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200723_173205.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200731_101230.jpg]]\n\n### August 2020\nCorona-numbers during summer were way down from spring, and we decided to have a little holiday after all. I found a nice-looking house on Bj√∂rk√∂ in the Northern Archipelago, and together with Chris, Stefan and Sarah we went there by Bus and ferry. Walking from the ferry stop to the house took about 30 min in lunchtime heat I think forever killed my desire to go on hiking holidays where you have to carry around all your stuff in a bagpack. The house was amazing and right in the middle of the little town on Bj√∂rk√∂, 3 min from the only ICA on the island. We didn't do much, besides getting up quite early, eating breakfast and reading on the veranda, going for a walk and/or swimming, chilling in the afternoon and BBQing in the evening. It was the perfect summer break, and only 1h bus ride from home. Every day I got better at going quickly into the 16¬∞C water and I LOVED the feeling and the freshness of the cool water and the waves. Laika did too, she was swimming with us every single day. I read a whole book (Station Eleven) during that week, and Duncan finished Humankind. I also made some cyanotypes of flowers and seaweeds and got the most tanned I've been in years. On a walk around the island we encountered some serious looking sheep. And in the minigold in the harbour we met a fat, fluffy cat that wanted belly rubs. Late in the evenings we went along the cliffs and watched the quiet ferries ping-poing between islands like some machines out of a Simon St√•hlenhag book.\nWe grew some oyster mushrooms in a kit we ordered online to see if a mushroom farm could be a business idea. One batch was good, then it went downhill. Abandoned the mushroom farm idea. But I also tried for the first time to make tempeh, and that was much more successful and longer lasting.\nDuncan had an exhibition of generative plotter art at Llama Lloyds caf√©. He even sold 2 of the prints (to Scott and Aurora), and it was the first (and only) time during 2020 that we saw many of our friends at once. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200810_160355.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200810_122522 1.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200809_211838.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200814_201843.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200816_081102.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200826_173612.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200829_110308.jpg]]\n\n### September 2020\n\nIn September started working seriously on several projects. I started planning for a fungal technology-focussed newsletter and I developed a business plan for The Mycobrewery, which developed from a community fermentation hub into food production into fermentation innovation with consultancy. I met a lot of different people that had some advice to give and wrote up a business plan. I also started an advanced Swedish course that took place online three times a week from 7:30 to 9:00. It was fun and it felt good to get something done already early in the morning. \nWe did several very long walks, one to the top of Hisingen (Kornhall), then over with the ferry to the main land and then up to Ytterby. Another one to Amunds√∂. Took the bus back because it was further than expected and it was super uncomfortable because it was so busy and crammed and of course no one was wearing face masks because that was not a thing Sweden recommended doing. \nWe got a new matress that would hopefully cure Duncan's morning back pain. I continued doing many many different tempeh trials. Max near Lindholmen opened, and in the beginning we ate there once a week. The sunflowers on the balcony started blooming, while the leaves on the trees started turning red already. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200905_103652.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200905_125127.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200930_110344.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200926_110418.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200924_165204.jpg]]\n\n### October 2020\nA guy with a topbun from Uddevalla picked up our old IKEA beds, and we ordered a new bedframe to fit our new matress. My days were filled with business planning, product development, Swedish and coding practice, job interviews and seminars. I met Ville from Miso i Majorna and started thinking about getting a production space. Handed in my starta eget st√∂d application to Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen. Also applied for an Oatly job. \nPawel moved to Kville and we made pineapple upside down cake and watched a lot of Great British Bakeoff. One weekend we walked with Chris all the way to V√§ttlefj√§ll and around the lakes there. Then I got a nosebleed and took the tram home with Laika. Duncan arrived 3 hours later, having walked a total 35 km on that day. \nIn the Polish shop on Herkulesgatan I found proper Zwetschken and made a delicious Zwetchkenfleck. I also made Sauerkraut with red cabbage that was fermenting for almost 2 months in our living room. And sourdough baguettes after my dad's recipe. On a walk to H√∂k√§lla with Mikael we found fresh Giant Puffballs. Autumn turned the leaves into the most beautiful colours. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201001_214520.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201030_121722.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201010_175757.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201017_101649.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201017_104902.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201019_161552.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201024_120200.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201026_144333.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201027_075951__01.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201029_123338.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201031_091715.jpg]]\n\n\n### November 2020\nI had some more interviews for the Oatly job in November, and Duncan for Possible. Otherwise, November was pretty uneventful, grey and rainy. I put up the Christmas lights on the balcony already on 1st November.\nI looked at several possible production places for the Mycobrewery, made some beautiful tempeh and crocheted a wooly hat. On the first frosty morning we walked around Hisingsparken. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201102_153116.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/DSCF5116.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201108_210443.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201128_090356.jpg]]\n\n\n### December 2020\nMore interviews for me and Duncan, and for both of us finally a job offer. The hard decision to agree to moving to Sk√•ne, start a job at Oatly and put the Mycobrewery for now on hold. \nDuncan gave an online dataviz workshop at Datafest Tbilisi. \nChristmas was calm. Sending and receiving parcels was a bit of a pain this year, since literally everyone was sending their presents and the postal services all over the place were massively overloaded and understaffed. \nPawel came over on the 25th and we drank Gl√ºhwein and chatted until late. First wine in a long time, but I didn't get any hangover. Most of the presents this year were either edible or soaps. I got Duncan a little keyboard numberblock and I got a voucher for nice scienc-y jewellery and e-books.\nI gave some tempeh to Scott, Aurora and Chris and Aurora liked it so much that she ordered 25 packages for her and her friends, which resulted in a wild bean cooking and tempeh incubating in the mellandagarna.\nThe weather in December was perpetually grey, overcast, rainy and just above 0¬∞C. Only 24 and 25 were wonderful with clear skies and crisp cold. \nIn the last weeks of 2020, Duncan got massively into modular synthesisers and started ordering the parts. \nI was a bit under the weather just before New Year's Eve, but we didn't have anything planned anyway. It was just Duncan, Laika and me, eating a lot of cheese, watching a stupid quiz show and playing a game about fungi. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201224_193920.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201225_102655.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201225_193457.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201229_104747.jpg]]\n\n\n### Notable things this year:\n\n#### Watched:\nSeries: Steven Universe, Picard, Star Trek Discovery season 3, Forged in Fire, Ultimate Beastmaster, The Crown season 4, The Queen's Gambit, Great British Bake-off, Tiger King, Star Trek TOS season 1, Star Trek Lower Decks\n\nFilms: Gymkata, Toy Story 2\n\n#### Read:\n- The Cat's Table (Michael Ondaatje)\n- **Atomic Habits (James Clear)**\n- How to Be a Bad Birdwatcher (Simon Barnes)\n- Tyll (Daniel Kehlmann) \n- The Wizard and the Prophet (Charles C.

Prince Philip died, Republican lunatics stormed the Capitol, the world got hotter, Americans withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years war. \nIn personal news, I started my job at Oatly, Duncan started at Possible, Laika got puppies, Mama \u0026 Papa got a dog, we moved to Helsingborg, I published several of my \"Filaments\" newsletter articles, Duncan released his Loud Numbers podcast, and Angie \u0026 Christian got engaged. \n\n## January\nDuncan's first day of Possible was on 6th January. Laika was in heat in the middle of January and we went to Bl√• Stj√§rnan to get her checked. Then everything went pretty quick: Birgitta panicked, Thomas picked Laika up (15 Jan), brought her back 6 hours later and they sent a video about the \"lovemaking\". Job done. \nI went to Landskrona to check out the city and visit some apartments that were for rent to have somewhere to stay during my upcoming new job. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/2021-01-14 14.30.23 1.jpeg]]\nOne of 5 visited seemed nice (the others were too dark, too smoky, too annoying landlord, and too big), and I agreed to take it on the same day: Murargatan 10.\nDuncan started to REALLY get into modular synth.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_20210107_223501.jpg]]\nWe kept observing Laika's nipples for most of January, to determine if she was pregnant. I made a nice green dress that I wore on the first day of work (together with the only time so far that I wore a blazer to work).\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_20210125_102358.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/first day at oatly.jpg]]\nMy first days at Oatly were actually the virtual introduction days. I received some merch to prepare for it:\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/oatly merch.png]]\nSomeone stole some stuff out of our cellar compartment (including my hiking boots and hiking backpack). Ausra got a baby (Martina). I got new glasses. \n\n\n\n## February\n4-7 February was (virtual) Outlier conference which Duncan helped put together. \nStill not sure if Laika was pregnant. \nI started going to Landksrona once a week to stay overnight in my little apartment on a (surprisingly comfortable) air matress that I borrowed from Punchalee. No other furniture though. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/LKR apartment.jpg]]\nThe lake in Hisingsparken froze over and kids were playing ice hockey on it. We actually had quite a nice winter, most of January, February and March were quite cold.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Hisingsparken 02.png]]\nAnd there were large ice sheets on the G√∂ta √Ñlv.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/ice sheets in G√∂ta √Ñlv.jpg]]\nBy that time I still hadn't had a goodbye party at Chalmers (because of Covid), so finally on 20th February Johan, Pawel, Scott and Aurora came for a walk and a falafel rulle at our favourite falafel place at Wieselgrensplatsen. They gave me a big flowerpot that had been decorated by Indbio people and a Chalmers tote bag. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/falafel.jpg]]\nWe climbed the hill behind Backaplan - Ar√∂dsberget and looked around with binoculars.\n\n## March\nDoes that look like a pregnant dog?\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/pregnang.jpg]]\nWe played a lot of Gloomhaven online with Chris (through Tabletop Simulator). Bascially all other friend activities were walks, walks, walks. I worked occasionally on the AA9 manuscript I still wanted to publish together with Monika, which took foreeeeever (not my fault...).\n\nDuncan proceeded on his modular synth journey and started soldering his first module (25 March). \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Duncan soldering.jpg]]\nAnd Laika got puppies!!! Lipton, Lexie and Luna were born on 16 March.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Laika puppies.png]]\nAlmost equally important, Duncan got a Tubble!\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/tubble.jpg]]\nI sewed a beige T-shirt that turned out only alright, and then I made a second one with adjustments that I liked much better. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/stefan tshirt.jpg]]\nWe walked through Nya Varvet with Eva and Kennet and ate waffles at a church. We also walked 26 km through Torslanda and Volvoland.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/torslandawalk.png]]\n\n## April\nDuncan and Pawel ran twice a week for a while. We attended a virtual Grandaddy concert, which was lovely - basically Jason Lytle in his little home studio. On Easter Sunday we went on a big walk through Bellevue, along the S√§ve√•n, and discovered the legendary Ove's Gatuk√∂k, where we had lunch.\n15-17 April we walked all 75 km of Gotaleden with Pawel. We stayed overnight in Jonsered and in N√§√§s Fabriken. Duncan took a gigantic cheese and onion pie with us that lasted for days. We had fantastic weather (cold enough to not sweat, but warm enough to not have to wear winter jackets) and the whole walk was really enjoyable. Saw loads of beaver chewed trunks along the river. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Gotaleden.jpeg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/gotaleden 02.jpeg]]\nDuncan had a lot of talks about his Loud Numbers podcast and got some merch.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/loud numbers.png]]\nWe convinced my parents to get one of Laika's puppies (since they had been thinking about getting a dog for a while). They were worried about getting the dog back to Austria because of Covid restrictions. I thought it wouldn't be a problem. Oh how wrong I was. \nDuncan worked on \"London under the microscope\", a data visualization/sonification of Covid numbers in London with Valentina d'Efilippo.\n\n\n## May\nI made a top with a much too large collar. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/top.jpg]]\nHisingsbron was inaugurated and we walked on a red carpet over it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/hisingsbron.jpg]]\nWe went to Helsingborg on 8 May, visited an apartment and walked around the city, getting used to the idea that this place will be our new home soon.\nBirgitta chose the right dog for my parents, Luna!\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna.jpg]] \nAnd on 12th May they both came back to us. OMG SO CUTE!!! The first few hours she just sat under the kitchen table and was unsure about the new environment. Weeks of sleepless nights, so many trips outside, so many poops to clean up. Lots of fighting and playing with mum Laika. Such a mischevious dog that kept on escaping the pen. Too many cute photos to include here. Ok, one:\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna home.jpg]]\nOk, one more:\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna laika.jpg]]\nGood thing that I could take several weeks of only working from home. I also took part in a pilot trial at RISE in Gothenburg, making feta and halloumi cheese. That was fun, and it meant that I didn't need to go to Landskrona but could work in GBG instead. Win win. \nWe tried to give Luna as much socialisation as was possible during Corona. Of course we also went to Llama Lloyd. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_1120.jpg]]\nAnd on the top of Ramberget.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/ramberget.jpg]]\n\n\n## June\nLoud Numbers launch!       \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X17zV8-4CdI\u0026t=6476s\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/loud numbers 1.png]]\nI made a top out of double gauze. So light and breezy. But it ripped on second wear.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/top2.jpg]]\nWe celebrated Nationaldagen with princesst√•rta and watching Duncan's one-year-postponed citizenship ceremony as a stream. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/nationaldagen.jpg]]\nAfter a lot of considering and reconsidering about how to get a puppy to Austria, we finally decided that Mama \u0026 Papa should come to Sweden as soon as they are double vaccinated. so finally in mid June they arrived and stayed for 2 weeks to befriend Luna, learn dog 101 and take a lot of walks around Gothenburg. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/mama papa luna.png]]\nLuna was a bit scared at first and even bit Mama in the ear when she got picked up. But over the next days they became good friends. Treats helped.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/treats.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/mama papa luna 02.jpg]]\nWe had burgers at Max and an epic downpour on the way home. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/downpour.png]]\nWe also had pizza at Dirty Dough that had glass from a lamp in it. Not our favourite pizza place in GBG any more...\nOn 27 June we met all of Laika's puppies on a meetup.\nI made trousers (and shorts with the same pattern) that I wore all summer long.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/trousers.jpg]]\n\n\n## July \nOn Duncan's birthday we went with Chris on a trip to H√∂n√∂ and a boat tour to Vinga. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/vinga.jpg]]\nWe walked along Gullbergsvass with Eva and Kennet and had burgers for lunch (then it started pouring).\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/gullbergsvass.jpg]]\nWe paid off the second third of our mortgage. Hooray! Laika and I celebrated with a (non-alco) beer on the balcony.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/balcony beer.jpg]]\nAs a little, relatively Covid-safe holiday activity, we took the slow train to Bor√•s and spent the day walking around. We had nice mezze tallrik lunch and a sit-down in the park. The train ride was definitely the highlight of the trip. Open windows, rolling through the forest, no other people in the carriage - bliss.\nAnother afternoon I went to Kinna on my own and had a little shopping spree at an enormous fabric outlet.\nWe visited Bailey and Gina in their new house in Bj√∂rlanda.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/bailey.jpg]]\nA big part of July was spent packing things into boxes. I freaked out several times because we have SO MUCH STUFF. \nOn 29 July, we went to Helsingborg to pick up the keys to our new apartment. \n\n## August\nOn 2nd August we moved to Helsingborg. We payed a moving company that showed up an hour too early, then halfway through packing up they complained that the entrance was too far away from the car and that they would have to charge us extra or we help. So we helped. Then took the train with Laika to Helsingborg, went to the new apartment, helped unload everything. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/move.jpg]]\nOn 4 August we took a nice walk through our nearby water reservoir/green area, saw a fox family and henceforth the area was called Fox Valley (even though we didn't see the foxes ever again). The same day we went to IKEA, had lunch there, and then took the train to Landskrona to stay over a last time in the apartment there. We had dinner on the beach.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/landskrona beach.png]]\nThe next day we took an early ferry to Ven and walked around the island. Laika wanted to hunt birds the whole time. Ven was very nice, sunny and hot (too sunny and hot for Duncan). We were some of the few people that walked, everyone else seems to be cycling on this island. It took half the day to walk around, then we had lunch and took the ferry back to Landskrona. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Ven.jpeg]]\nWe tried to test as many restaurants as possible in Helsingborg, as long as sitting outside was still okay to do. We discovered a fantastic vegan Vietnamese place (Chay), an amazing pizza place (Benchwarmers) and a great South Indian restaurant (The South Indian). And we also once had the great idea of skipping lunch and just having sweets at Sweet House Cafe. I had a fruit salad with ice cream and about 10 kit kats, while Duncan had ice cream rolls, which consistet only of ice cream - a whole soup bowl full of it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/waffle house.png]]\n13-15 August we went on a Sk√•ne road trip with Chris. We stayed in a crazy Buddhist temple in the middle of the forest, called the Yangtorp Sanctuary. We visited Stenhuvud national park, Kivik, drank a lot of √§ppelmust and ate mediocre pizza.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/yangtorp.png]]\nI took a Domestika course on how to mend clothes by stitching and started fixing Duncan's trousers that are all broken at the left knee.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/fixing.jpg]]\n27 Aug we went to GBG for the day to get our second Covid shot!\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/2nd shot.jpg]]\nI took up a freelance gig with Libre Foods, a start-up from Barcelona that wants to make mycelium-based meat. Very nice and overly ambitious CEO, who is completely clueless about the science and realistic timelines. \n\n## September\nDuncan's cousing Becky died, and the extended family had a memorial service via Zoom. The weather was mostly wet, and when we went on a walk through P√•lsj√∂ skogen, we saw SO many mushrooms!\nI sewed a boxy jacket (with lining!) with the light blue cordoroy I bought in Kinna.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/stacker jacket.jpg]]\nAt the end of September I took the train to Austria. This time daytime instead of night train. It was all fine, but 18 hours wearing a facemask was quite exhausting. Didn't drink or eat much during the whole travel. \nAustria was very nice, and still late-summery (25C) while Sweden was already firmly in autumn. Hung around a lot with Luna in Zipf, visited Tante Angela, Tante Gerti and Onkel Harald, took a trip to Attersee and saw the mountains. Then drove in Angie's new little red car to Vienna. Met up with Stefan, Stephan and Petra in Augarten, then went to a Beisl with Biergarten. This is one of the main things I miss from Austria: the ease to hang out with friends, talk about everything and nothing, have a beer and let the afternoon pass, take the U-Bahn home. Omg, and the bakeries! \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna + family.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/augarten.jpg]]\n\n## October\nWe went to Bosses Mattor to pick up some rugs for our new apartment, since it's so much bigger and has a lot of empty floor. So many ugly specimens in this shop! But we found two decent ones: a round one from very nice grey wool, and a rectangular one that looks like the scraggly rocks of Bohusl√§n.\nEarly on a nice Sunday we took the ferry to Helsing√∂r and walked around for 4 hours. Cute little city, but loads of \"to let\" signs in shop windows. We found an excellent bakery and took some bread back for lunch.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Helsing√∂r.jpg]]\nWe met my colleague Kerstin's dog Hero and went for a walk with them, then got a lot of apples from Kerstin's garden that I made into apple pie and apple compot. I also grew Koji on oat residues from work to try to make some kind of shoyu. \nWe walked to P√•lsj√∂ skogen again and had mushroom and tomato soup in the little pavillion restaurant on basically their last day of the season. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/p√•lsj√∂.jpg]]\nWe had the first visitor in Helsingborg - Munir, an old uni friend of Duncan's who now lives near Falkenberg. \n\n\n## November\nWe took a long walk down to R√•√•, past Planteringen and through tallskogen. Nice area, but not really much wild nature. \nSewed the same trousers for me and Duncan to be able to lounge in style.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/tula pants 02.jpg]]\nWent to a little outside fika organised by our housing organisation Balder and complained about the cigarette smoke smell in our kitchen, the broken door to the laundry room, the constantly open front door (because someone stuffs cigarette butts into the lock) and a missing bike room. They were actually quite receptive, and some of those things were fixed quite quickly (though the cigarette smoke probably disappeared because our neighbours moved out).\nIn mid November we went to GBG for the weekend and stayed at Clarion Post Hotel to treat ourselves. Duncan really wanted a bathtub, since the new apartment's bathroom is much too small to fit the Tubble (which has been parked in the cellar compartment in GBG since August...). We arrived when the big ribbon on the hotel was being illuminated for the Christmas season. There are so many more people in Gothenburg than in Helsingborg! \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/clarion.jpg]]\nThe room was not quite as nice as I'd hoped (probably because we needed the dog room) and the bathtub was only half size, but the breakfast buffet was quite good. We met Matt for an early walk, where we got completely drenched, then I met Johan for fika, then Chris in his apartment, and then I went to Dan's PhD defence pary in the student pub. I was hesistant to go at first, because of Corona and also because I didn't know how many Indbio people I would still know, but it was actually quite nice. On Sunday we had a walk with Isak on Hisingen, then had lunch with Scott and then I met up with Ausra for a walk through Slottsskogen. In the evening we had takeway Indian biryani that was so spicy we had to abandon it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/GBG.jpg]]\n\n\n## December\nAt the beginning of December, Duncan flew to England for the first time in over two years to see his family and meet his Possible colleagues. Laika and I had the first snow in Helsingborg, which we both LOVED, but sadly it was gone again two days later. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/snow.jpg]]\nI had a 3-day work trip to Tetra Pak in Aalborg to test some cheese mixing equipment with my colleagues Yoga and Magnus. It was quite exhausting because our host talked without a break, and we \"had\" to attend a dinner in a completely packed Italian restaurant. It was very odd to be in a packed restaurant again after 2 years of more or less self-isolation, and I was sure I would catch Covid there, but I don't think I did. \nDecember was - as expected - very dark, grey and wet/cold, so quite unpleasant and depressing. We bought some additional lamps to light the apartment. After 3pm it was hard to see my face in online meetings, because it was so dark at my desk. \nOut of longing for Christmas traditions and a bit of homesickness, I made a lot of Christmas cookies (but regretted it halfway through baking, as is always the case). \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/kekse.jpg]]\nWe found a hunddagis near us and tried Laika for 2 half days, which worked fine, so we signed her up for 2 days a week from January.\nOn Christmas it was just the three of us. We had sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes on the 24th, and tempeh Wellington on the 25th. \nI got Duncan a Thobe from a nice, stretchy bamboo fabric, and he got me a monthly sock subscription for 2022, and two nice cookbooks (Ottolenghi, Meera Sodha). Mama sent a finished dress that I didn't manage to sew by myself, and Papa sent a USB stick with childhood photos.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/thobe.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Christmas 2021.jpg]]\nWe took a walk to Bruce's skog on Boxing Day. And we played a lot of Squash during the mellandagarna in our newly discovered squash place in the centre.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/bruce.jpg]]\nNew Year's Eve we spent at home on the sofa. At 12:00 we went to bed and watched the fireworks through the bedroom window. \n\n\n\n## Read:\n**Kissa by Kissa (Craig Mod)**\nThe Star Mountains (T.A.S.

The snow is still on the ground and we took a walk (10:30-12:00) with Chris, Natasa and Murray. Murray was even more excited than usual, because Laika is in heat right now. \nWork: Filaments episode 3 writing\nLooked at a lot of apartments in Helsingborg and Landskrona and intressanm√§lade many, only to realise that this is probably completely pointless because it just _feels_ like I'm making progress, but don't actually have a realistic chance for any of these apartments. New plan: make a blocket ad and go for 2nd hand contract. \nFelt a bit sad in the evening about moving and being apart from Duncan and Laika for what will probably be longer than I think. Lonely evenings in a bleak room, etc. I'll need to make some good plans to not fall in to an \"√Ös-hole\" and have some nice things to do for the evenings: reading, yoga, listening to music, coding, etc. \n\n#### 10 January \nWork: Filaments episode 3 writing (how is this taking so long??!!)\nCooked: Pizza and vegan brownies\nWalked up L√•ng√§ngen. It was super icy. \n30 min yoga with Duncan in the evening. \nGot an idea to look into capsule wardrobe for work, since I just started wondering what kind of dresscode (if any) there is at Oatly and what I want to represent with my clothes. Do I still want to show up in quirky Threadless T-shirts, colourful tights and sneakers? Time to find a good style! \nA\u0026C's cat Darwin had to go to the vet hospital, since he hasn't been eating for several days. Not sure what's wrong with him. \nWe started doing a Google Sheets tutorial https://courses.benlcollins.com/courses/222121/lectures/3583529 that seems very useful. \n\n#### 11 January \nWork: Finished Filaments episod 3\nArranged some apartment viewings in Landskrona on 14 Jan. Suddenly I got responses from about 5 or 6 places. Seems like everyone's back from their Christmas break now, and it might actually be quite easy to get something in either Landskrona or Helsingborg (still nothing showing up from Lund though).\nWalked around Kville and up Kvilleb√§cken. It was rainy and all the snow disappeared.\nOrdered a lot of basics from Muji that would work for some work outfits. Also ordered two blazers from Zalando to try on. My first blazers ever. \nTwo people showed up that responsed to my Facebook/Instagram post about giving things away. They took some boardgames, chopsticks, floor cleaner, etc.\n\n\n#### 12 January\nMade berbere (this recipe https://www.daringgourmet.com/berbere-ethiopian-spice-blend/). Also a lot of mealplanning for this and next week.\nArranged some more viewings for Thursday in Landskrona and booked trains. \nAlso watched some videos about design solutions for small apartments. \nDog walk with √åsak and Buffy up Ramberget in the evening. \n\n#### 13 January\nBl√• Stj√§rnan Djursjukhus with Laika to get the checks Birgitta requires: eyes, hips, knees, blood test. For the hip x-ray she got sedated and she was getting sooo sleepy and it was the cutest thing. \u003c3 Everything seemed fine with the results we got, but when I wrote Birgitta that she also might be in heat since a few days (weeks?) things got super stressful. Might have to go back to Bl√• Stj√§rnan to get some more tests done. \n\n\n#### 14 January\nManaged to arrange 5 apartment viewings for one afternoon in Landskrona, so took the train in the morning. Weird being on trams and trains again for the first time in almost a year. About half of the people were wearing masks, but most took them off once they had boarded the train. \nLandskrona: Seems quite cute, loads of colourful Danish-style houses and brickbuildings. Nice water tower, everything's very walkable. Not so many shops or restaurants visible, but I didn't quite reach the city centre (or the waterside). \nApartment 1: Nice and compact, clean, new windows, nice kitchen, fairly new bathroom. \nApartment 2: About 10 people want to view it. Mother with two teenage daughters and a cat still live in it. Only m√§klare today that required masks and handsprit when viewing. \nApartment 3+4: Annoying landlord that tries to oversell his nice 1920s building: 5th floor without lift, old windows that can't be opened, not allowed to drill into the walls, etc. Everything's a bit stuffy and mucky and dark.\nApartment 5: Even through my mask I smell the cigarette stench in it. Kitchen window is right out onto the street and pavement. \nBack at the train station I wrote the m√§klare of apartment 1 that I want it and later that evening I signed the contract. Yay! One worry less. Moving in date is 1 Feb, rent is 4067 SEK. \nOtherwise: Sk√•ne is very flat, but had slightly more snow than GBG. I was incredibly cold the whole afternoon, just ambling around the city at -6¬∞C for 5 hours. \n\n#### 15 January\nWent to Bl√• Stj√§rnan again for Laika's progesterone test. Results showed that she is (was?) at the peak of the scale, which made Birgitta even more stressed and eventually her husband picked Laika up for some early evening hanky-panky with Destu. We'll know in a few weeks if it worked. Birgitta sent some videos of the \"action\"... \n\n#### 16 January\nSpent the whole day editing Duncan's Loud Numbers. Bit complicated, because it has loads of soundbites and a conversation-style bit with Miriam, etc. \n\n#### 17 January\nAnother day with mostly editing the video. Almost done.\nSkype with H√ºttners. Angie's cat Darwin is at home and feeling better again. Papa's foot is still painful, Mama's shoulder is still painful. They're clearing out the attic a bit, which has been their main corona activity since March. Papa working on the Chronik, Mama exchanging slide frames from glass to plastic. \n\n#### 18 January\nCycled to Marklandsgatan to meet Ausra for a walk through Slottsskogen. Tires slipped on the ice and I fell, but in slow motion. Met Ausra's baby that is still just called Peanut and is now 2 weeks old. Got all the gruesome details of the birth, and the hard time during and after due to corona restrictions: she wasn't allowed to go to hospital until the baby was basically coming out, it wasn't sure if Marco was allowed in (he was eventually let in just for delivery), she was completely on her own for 4 days after birth because no one is allowed to visit, etc. \n\n#### 19 January\nEasy day, mostly reading and watching Ugly House to Lovely House. Baked a vegan almond cardamom cake that was so-so. \n\n#### 20 January \nAnother easy day. Planned a bit for Landskrona, like how I am going to sleep and how I will install blinds or curtains etc. I don't want to buy too much unnecessary stuff for that apartment, especially since it's going to be so temporary. On the other hand I want it really cosy and inviting, so I actually enjoy being there. And sleeping well is a BIG thing for me, esp. since I have not had a great night of sleep for half a year (I still blame the new matress). For the first nights though I have borrowed Punchalee's air matress. \n\n#### 21 January\nWent to pick new glasses at Optikk√§llaren in the morning. Took me about an hour and dozens of photos/videos to pick one among 20ish shortlisted. Came back in the afternoon to get an eye test (left side slightly worse due to more astigmatism). Then optician told me that the glasses are too big for the glass I will get, so I should pick another pair. Took me another hour to go back and try to pick another pair. Finally came up with one, only for the optician to tell me I should stick with the original one. Arrgh. Now I'm doubting if the original ones were the right decison (are they too big??). Cost 4000 SEK. \nWeather: SUPERwindy and rainy, mostly for the times I was on a bike to and from the optician. Afternoon we had some spots of blue sky. \nDinner: East African. SO GOOD.\n\n#### 22 January\nSlept on the air matress to test it out (with a matress topper on top). Much better than expected. Felt actually better than after most nights on the actual matress, less neck stiffness. \nOnline Yoga session with some of the Possible crew. \nFirst online meeting with some of my new Oatly colleagues. About 30 will participate in the introduction days next week. It will feel odd to be part of a team again. I was worried that I might get quizzed about enzyme things in my first days, so I revised some basic things like amino acid codes. I never actually learned the one letter codes, let alone the structures or categories. Felt like I should probably know that as an Enzyme Technology Specialist.\nDid some coding (trying to understand JS Promises and asynchronous functions). \nLunch: Take away from Babemba food truck at Kvilletorget (Malinesian food). \nIt snowed in the morning, but it was gone again by the afternoon. \n\n#### 23 January\nCalm Saturday. Lots of sewing. \n\n#### 24 January\nFinished sewing my nice Indigo dress with the bottle-green bird pattern. Turned out really nice, after I tucked in the sides a bit. \n\n#### 25 January \nPacked up some things for Landskrona. \n\n#### 26 January\nTrain to Landskrona to meet m√§klare and get the keys. Her sk√•nska was much less understandable this time, but I think I understood all the important things. Brought an airmatress to serve as semi-temporary bed. But I stayed the night in a hotel, because there are no curtains yet in the apartment. The hotel was basic and the room was quite cold (maybe they pumped up the ventilation due to Corona?). Walked through the centre in the evening to get some food. It was pretty empty, except for one small street with a busy coffeeshop on. Got Banh Mi, summer rolls and a chocolate muffin. Ate it in the hotel bed while watching Blown Away on Netflix. \n\n#### 27 January\n1st day at Oatly! Pleasantly surprised that they actually take some serious Corona measures: temperature check at the entrance, mask requirements, limited presence, etc. Met Karin and she showed me around, but there were barely any people in the offices. Got my laptop and an HR introduction. Lunch with Karin (bit shocked that there are no vegan and barely any vegetarian options in the vending machine - need to talk to the sustainability department about that!), then sat in on a call with the new oat breeder. So much is happening in Swedish, think I will really need to up my game there. Had a peek in the lab, seems a bit small and crowded, but they're expanding the whole facility right now. Train back to GBG, pretty empty. Arrived at home at 20:00. \n\n#### 28 January\nOatly Introduction Days part 1: Presentations by sustainability, HR, etc. Nice chats in breakout rooms. The after work activities were slightly cringey and stressful. I participated in the quiz for my team, which went really well (2nd place). Wanted to show a trick with Laika, but she was sleepy and it failed. Felt stressed for hours after that! \n\n#### 29 January\nCold (-6¬∞C) and sunny. \nOatly Introduction Days part 2: Presentations by creative department, innovation, Toni, etc. Today I turned my camera off for most of the day, which was much less exhausting. Feeling good about starting at this company, they emphasise their sustainability thinking so much, that I hope it's actually true. \nShort call with my future colleague Johan Qvist made me realise that I have to really revise some of my enzyme knowledge. \nDinner: Tried the new Indian/Pizza/Kebab/Somalian restaurant \"Singh is Kinng\" on Kvilletorget. Chana Masala and Dal Tarka. Not bad. Tastes quite homecooked, not as oily as most other Indian restaurants.\n\n#### 30 January\nCold (-8¬∞C) and sunny. Morning walk to Hornbach to buy some curtain rods to bring to Landskrona. Picked up my new glasses at Optikk√§llaren. Cooked dal and Ottolenghi. Otherwise calm day with 2h Skype call with M\u0026P\u0026A, telling them all about my first days at Oatly. \nEvening: Listening to Arlo Parks while solving Nonograms with Duncan \u003c3 \n\n#### 31 January\nCold (-10¬∞C) and foggy in the morning, but already at 9:30 breaking up and getting sunny. We took a nice early walk in the fog and Laika's whiskers and eyebrows got all icy. \n\n#### February\n\nWhat we left behind - DS9 documentary\nAlphaGo documentary\nRe-watching all of Parks \u0026 Recreation, mostly during my lonely evenings in Landskrona.\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:57.70943532Z","tags":null},"/private/Yearly-reviews/2022-Review/2022-Review":{"title":"","content":"## 2022\n### January\n**01-01-2022**: Started the new year in bed, cuddling with Duncan and Laika, looking at the fireworks through our bedroom window, drinking √§ppel gl√∂gg and listening to the Donauwalzer.\n**01-01-2022**: Signed up for HGB matkooperativet\n**05-01-2022**: Got a new rice cooker!

More than 30 000 in Sweden in the last 24h. Schools stay open, they say, and the \"stricter\" restrictions will be bars closing at 23:00 and recommendations to work from home.

Saw loads of birds in the garden.\n**31-01-2022**: Got my 3rd Covid shot. My arm hurt for two days.\n\nMade a dress from a fabric I got from Ros for Christmas:\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Jan%20-%2002%20new%20dress.jpg)\n\nI tried some fermentations with oat residue from Landskrona. I mixed it with soybeans to make tempeh (worked ok and got nicely chewy). I also mixed it with koji rice to make a soy residue shoyu. Not entirely sure if I like the taste. \n\n### February\nLaika being in the hunddagis resulted in her having kennelhosta once, and me having a pregnancy scare for her. I wasn't sure if she had been in heat, and still let her go to dagis, and then got paranoid that there couldn've been some unobserved dog sex in the hunddagis. Went to the vet, who said \"probably not\" but gave me a follow-up appointment for an ultrasound. Ultrasound also didn't show anything. Phew!\n\nLaika really perfected the \"I put my chin on their leg or the sofa or whatever and wait for food\" move. Occasionally she honks like a goose while doing that.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%20Laika.jpg)\n\nThe flocks of birds in Landskrona were spectacular! I had to stop several times on my bike home from work to just look at the thousands of birds moving above me. Are they crows? Or geese? I still don't know. One morning I even convinced Duncan to come along with Laika on the morning train to work and walk with me a bit towards Oatly, just to experience the number of birds that hang out around there. \n\n\n\nI hired a window cleaner, since the longer and occasional sunny days really make the windows look super dirty. And they are the weird kind that flips inside out and is scary to do yourself. Half an hour and 350 SEK later they are sparkling clean! Best investement in 2022 so far.\n\nI started a little collaboration with Nina from the Elevate Membership program. We want to visualise something on maps. Will need to use my Python knowledge and learn some things about Open streetmap API, etc. \n\n\nAngie visited for 4 days, Fri-Mon! We tried to take it easy but still managed to do a lot. Picked her up on Friday morning at the airport, then we looked for wedding-appropriate dresses in Copenhagen (didn't find anything), then took the train up to Helsing√∏r, ferry over to Helsingborg, then tour through our apartment, then early dinner at Chay (first restaurant visit since Covid!!). \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2001%20Angie%20in%20HBG%201.jpg)\n\nSaturday, we went through Helsingborg, bit of clothes shopping in the centre, walked along the harbour, cooked nice dinner, watched The French Dispatch (didn't really like it). \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2002%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2003%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)\n\nSunday, we had a nice long morning walk along Tallskogsleden all the way to R√•√•, walked on the beach, then took the bus back. Played a lot of Zelda Breath of the Wild, cooked nice food again. Monday, she cut my hair, we went grocery shopping, then played some more Zelda and had a long walk through Fredriksdal. The weather all week was amazing (sunny and blue sky, and -2 to 6C). Duncan had a migraine for most of the weekend :/ \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2004%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)\n\n\n### March\nUkraine war started. \n\nI started a fermentation visualization project with Max from Elevate. We want to collect and show information about different dairy ferment from all over the world.\n\nOn the last of Laika's hunddagis adventure (before we took her out again because it didn't actually save us much time) we finally managed to take advantage of being dog-free. We took the day off, went over to Helsing√∏r and walked to Humleb√¶k to visit the Lousiana museum. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%2001%20Trip%20to%20Louisiana%20museum.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%2002%20Trip%20to%20Louisiana%20museum.jpg)\n\nOn a sunny Sunday at the end of March we walked to R√•√• and had picnic along the way. Crocusses everywhere.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20R√•√•%20walk%2001.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20R√•√•%20walk%2002.jpg)\n\n\nI bought two jackets at Pingstkyrkan second hand, mostly for walks and hikes.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20Pingis.jpg)\n\n\n### April\nNorway train trip (1-6 April): We went by train to GBG and dropped Laika off to stay with Chris. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Trip%20to%20Oslo,%20Ede.jpg)\n\nThen we went futher to Oslo, where we arrived at 2 in the afternoon. Walked around a fancy villa quarter until we reached the Frognerparken and Vigelandsparken. Had some hot chocolate surrounded by small birds. All over the city were Ukrainian flags, almost more than Norwegian ones. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Oslo.jpg)\n\n\nNext morning we took the Bergensbanan. It slowly climbed up from Oslo towards the highest point in Finse. Almost unnoticeable the landscape turned from early spring back to snow and ice. We were in our cosy train, gliding through the white landscape. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Finse.jpeg)\n\nIn Myrdal we switched to the Fl√•mbana which crawled down the mountains along the World's steepest railway track to end up in the fjord village of Fl√•m. The landscape turned back to post-snow spring greyness. We stayed 3 nights at the Fl√•m Marina, with a beautiful few of the fjord from our window. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Fl√•m.jpeg)\n\n\nOne highlight was taking a fjord trip from Guldvangen to Fl√•m on the electric ship Power of the Fjords. It was very low and very quiet, and the whole trip felt like just gliding silently above the water. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20fjords.jpeg)\n\nOn the last day in Fl√•m, we walked halfway up the surrounding mountains. \n\nThe next morning, the Fl√•mbana brought us back up to Myrdal. We had the whole carriage to ourselves, and Duncan took out his synth to compose something along the way. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Fl√•mbana%2001.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Fl√•mbana%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Fl√•mbana%2003.jpg)\n\nIn the afternoon, we arrived in Bergen. The sun was shining and a blustery wind was blowing. We tried to see as much of the inner city as possible before it got dark. I really like the colourful houses, the rough sea, the views and the cute streets. We found an excellent vegan restaurant where we had a nice anniversary meal (10 years since Last.fm messages!!) and stayed over night in a hundreds year old hotel with dark wooden beams along the ceiling. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2001.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Anniversary.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2003.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2004.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2005.jpeg)\n\nThe next morning, Bergen was covered in snow. After breakfast we walked to the station, and sat 7 hours on the train back to Oslo, going in reverse from slightly snowy landscape to icy plateaus to Oslo in the spring time. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergensbana.jpg)\n\nWe walked around some cool neighbourhoods in Oslo, had Indian food and stayed in a hostel without any (visible) staff. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Oslo%2003.jpg)\n\nThen train back to GBG to pick up Laika, and we were back in HBG at 6 pm. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Train%20back.jpg)\n\n\nWalk in Raml√∂sa brunnspark with Supansa and Johan Westman (former Chalmers colleague of mine). He works at Chr. Hansen and she's at Lund University. Their two small boys were quite wild.\n\n\nOver the Easter weekend we walked Kullaleden. We started from home and started walking through Helsingborg towards P√•lsj√∂ skog and beyond, along the coast to Hittarp, Domsten, Viken and H√∂gan√§s. For a very long time, Kronoberg castle in Helsing√∏r was still visible on its exposed position. The birds were screetching and there were very few people on the way. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2001.jpg)\n\nAfter staying in a holiday home near the beach, we took the bus back to Helsingborg to pick up Duncan's phone charger. Then bus back to where we left off, and continued walking to M√∂lle. Realised that there was no supermarket in M√∂lle, so we took the bus back to Nyhamn to buy some things. Then back to M√∂lle. We walked up Kullaberg to the lighthouse in the afternoon. The whole forest smelled of wild garlic, which covered the ground everywhere. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2003.jpg)\n\nWe had halloumi burgers in a pub in M√∂lle harbour. Sadly, despite staying in the fancy Hotel Kullaberg, our room didn't have enough warm water to have a bath in the evening. The next day, we cut through Kullaberg, walked up Sk√•nes highest point and continued on to Arild, Svanshall and Bl√§singe, where we stayed over at a very charming hostel at the end of a very long plant nursery. I also bought a rock painted like a chick from a roadside cupboard. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2004.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2002.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2005.jpg)\n\nOn the last day, we walked along a looong sandy beach and sandy pine forests to √Ñngelholm, visited the UFO monument, had falafel rulle and took the train back home. Laika was a champion and walked all 100 km without any problems. She always had the energy to chase after little birds on the beach. \n\nDuncan bought me cucumber-flavoured ice lollies from the ice cream truck.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20Gurkis.jpg)\n\n\nI sewed a mint green bolero jacket that goes with the dress I wanted to wear for weddings this year. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20bolero.jpg)\n\n\n### May\nJenny, Josh and Hel√©n visited us in HBG over the weekend. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20Visit.jpg)\n\n\nEurovision 2022 took place in Turin. Russia was excluded because of their invasion of Ukraine. We loved Romania (\"Hola me bebebe, llamame, llamame.\") and Moldova (\"Kisinau, Bukarest!\"). Sweden wasn't bad (Hold me closer), Finland sent The Rasmus (Jezebel), UK took second place (Spaceman) and Ukraine won (Stefania). \n\nEngland trip, Melissa \u0026 Nicola's wedding, Torquay: We went to England for 10 days to attend the Amoridge wedding. On the way to Gothenburg we dropped Laika off to stay with Isak, Callo and Buffy. We stayed in the quite subpar Hotel Eriksbergshallen and took a flight to Heathrow the next day. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%20trip%2001.jpg)\n\nThe weekend was all about family and wedding. We stayed in an amazing little bungalow with a hot tub and went into the hot tub about 6 times in the 3 days we were there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2002.jpg)\n\nThe wedding was very nice - outside in a big garden, with the brides underneath a big tree. There was singing (\"500 miles\", Fabian), trumpes, poetry, pagean rituals and vegan catering (including a vegan cake buffet). Next day we all went on a walk across the fields to have a big pub lunch. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2003.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2003a.jpg)\n\nOn Monday morning we went to the small administrative wedding in Eastbourne, and then by train via Gatwick and Reading to Torquay. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2004.jpg)\n\nWe stayed in Duncan's parent's flat on Warren Road and took a nice long walk along the coast via Paignton to Brixham, found a cute caf√© on the way and then took the boat back to Torquay. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2005.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2005a.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2006a.jpg)\n\nEverything was preparing for the Queen's Jubilee Weekend, which was to happen the week after we were there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2007a.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2007b.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2006.jpg)\n\nOne evening we had dinner with Miriam and her husband in Totnes, and one day we went to Bristol. We walked through Bristol and over the Clifton Suspension Bridge, visited the zoo and power walked back to the station to briefly meet Duncan's Possible colleague before getting the train back to Torquay. We spent the last two day of our England trip in Reading, then flew back to GBG, picked up our dog, had lunch with Scott and Aurora and came back to Helsingborg.\n\n### June\nI joined the Community group for Matkooperativet and we had occasional meetings to plan some  member events, like a barbecue (that then never took place because of rain). \n\nWe also joined Helsingborganas Klimatavtal - a little climate activist group consisting mostly of the same people as Matkooperativet. \n\nChris visited for a weekend and we went with his car to the national park S√∂der√•sen. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20S√∂der√•sen.jpg)\n\nOn Saturday, 11 June, we visited Karl, Frida and baby Alfred in Kungsbacka. We had a nice walk around the forest, grilled sausages at a lake and then visited their new house, which was heavily decorated with (only?) photos of the three of them. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Kungsbacka.jpg)\n\nBy later May/early June all of Helsingborg's parks had explosed into flowers, especially the Rhododendrons. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Flowers.jpg)\n\nI made diary and plant-based yogurts in the rice cooker (pretty successfully). On some sunny, warm afternoons I hung out with Laika, a book and a thermos full of iced coffee in the park.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Park.jpg)\n\nScott and Aurora visited us in Helsingborg; we walked to P√•lsj√∂ skog and had ice cream in Gr√∂ningen. \n\nH22 expo was also taking place during June, but to be honest there was not much to do and we missed most of it. We attended one event about a sustainable mall, but it was quite bad. And we bought food at the food truck festival; it was rainy and about 10 C and we ate our food on a park bench. \n\nDuncan and his Elevate gang organized an online dataviz conference and I presented my mapping project of Gothenburg's street names: https://silfaz.github.io/gbgclusters/\n\nThis was at 10 pm on 21 June:\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Helsingborg.jpg)\n\nOn midsummer, it was pretty warm and we had picnic in the park.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Midsommar.jpg)\n\n\n### July\nFor Duncan's birthday weekend we went to Malm√∂ and stayed over in a \"bike hostel\" (which looked more like a prison cell) near Turning Torso. It was the first proper time exploring Malm√∂: we let Laika run on the dog beach, had fantastic pizza (twice!) and walked through M√∂llev√•ngen and Folkets Park. We also met two of Duncan's Possible colleagues who came through to study good concepts of car-free cities. We had cake in the park and Laika chased a cat. We also explored V√§stra Hamnen and had the BEST strawberries from a small stand outside of ICA. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malm√∂.jpg)\n\nBuffy stayed with us for a few days, which overlapped on the last day with both Duncan's family visiting and Chris staying over to go to a concert with us. It all worked out fine. The first concert after peak pandemic! The Sounds, Mando Diao and The Hives in Sofiero park. Really fun and chill, and the smoothest and most efficient leaving-the-venue experience I've ever had at a concert. \n\nDuncan's family (Ros, Edmund and later also Melissa and Nicola) stayed for over a week and we showed them everything: Helsinborg, M√∂lle, Helsing√∏r, Malm√∂, Copenhagen. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20M√∂lle.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20M√∂lle%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malm√∂%2003.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malm√∂%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20HBG.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20HBG%2004.jpg)\n\nThe weather was mostly great, I swam in the sea several times (despite it only being 16-18C) and we had a particularly good time in Copenhagen where we explored the less touristy parts like N√∏rrebro and the post-industrial area around the ski-slope-waste-incinerator Copenhill and the food truck place Reffen. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2001.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2003.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2005.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2007.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2009.jpeg)\n\nThe weekend after we went to GBG to hang out with many of ours friends in the park (Stefan, Sara, Chris, Mikael, Siri, Josefine + boyfriend, Scott) for a little birthday picnic. \n\n\n### August\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Duncan%20and%20Laika.jpg)\n\nThe first weekend in August, Jonas and Lisa visited us from the Netherlands and stayed over a few days. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Jonas%20and%20Lisa.jpg)\n\nI participated in the big Oatly oat harvest for the oat breeding group in a field near Lund.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Oat%20harvest.jpg)\n\nI made a self-drafted summer dress. Duncan sold his bike that had been standing unused in the cellar for 1.5 years and then bought a bass guitar.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Dress.jpg)\n\nAnd at the end of August we went to Borrby for a H√ºttner family holiday. We had a nice house with a hot tub and only 5 min walk to the endless sand beach. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Borrby%2002.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Borrby.jpg)\n\nLaika and Luna met again for the first time after separation (and hated each other initially), we took a trip to Stenshuvud Nationalpark and to Kivik for √§ppelmust, and Angie and Chris got married in Ystad. I also went swimming a few times! \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Balloons.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Wedding%2001.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Wedding%2002.jpeg)\n\n\n### September\nThe week after Borrby, Mama, Papa and Luna stayed in Helsingborg in a hostel down the road from our house, and we had some more nice walks and trips. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Pussh√•llplats.jpg)\n\nAnd I got Mama's old Overlock machine (they had come here by car)! Their trip back home took another week, since they avoided motorways completely. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Overlocker.jpg)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8th September. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/Screenshot%202022-09-08%20at%2020.56.07.png)\n_Screenshot from BBC News_\n\nDuncan and had a little trip to Lund: we walked around, had African food from a food truck, bought nice nail polishes and Duncan bought fingerless gloves from a fishing supply shop.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Duncan.jpg)\n\nI bought new glasses with a clear frame.\n\nBought an exercise bike on Blocket for 750 SEK, and got it delivered by the seller for an extra 50 SEK. We decided to cycle from Helsingborg to Haparanda. \n\nAt the end of September I took the night train from Hamburg to Vienna. I had 4 hours in Hamburg and walked around the city a bit - got a good impression, in contrast to the first few times I had to change trains here. The trip was mostly to attend the 20-year anniversary of my university year: we were about 30 people and visited the Muthgasse premises and then walked up Kahlenberg to a nice Heurigen. Most people hadn't really changed much - don't know if that's good or bad. Otherwise, I spent the time mostly with Angie: we went to the new vegan Billa Pflanzilla supermarket (vegan Bananenschnitten and vegan Leberk√§se!!), spent a lot of time in Komolka looking at fabrics, had dinner with Tante Irmi \u0026 Onkel Bertram, and met Stefan, Stephanstefan and others in a pub. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Percy.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Austria%2003.jpg)\nAfter a few days in Vienna I spent some time in Zipf, which was really nice. The weather was very summery and we visited some place in the area that I had never properly visited, like Ampflwang and Gmunden. I also remember spending a lot of time in the dairy section in various supermarkets to check out the varieties and ingredients of plant-based and dairy yogurt products because of the oat gurt project I had become involved with at Oatly. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Austria%2001.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Austria%2002.jpg)\n\n### October \nA few days after I came back from Austria, Duncan went by train for a week to Netherlands and Luxemburg for a Loud Numbers workshop and a data sonification conference. \n\nI got several kilos of garden apples from my colleague Kerstin which I turned into Apfelmus. \n\nI had a health check from work and got pretty good marks for blood sugar, blood fat, blood pressure and lung capacity. They didn't check much else. \nI also got my 4th covid vaccination. No one in Sweden officially recommended it to under-65-year-olds, but it was also no problem to book a slot and show up to get the vaccination. \n\nOne Saturday we went to M√∂lle for pizza. It was good, but cold.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20M√∂lle.jpg)\n\n### November\nBuffy stayed with us for 10 days while Isak and Callo went to Turkey. She and Laika got along fine, they're just not exactly best friends. And I will never get used to the weird way that Buffy pees: just standing on her front legs. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20November%20-%20Buffy%2002.jpg)\n\nWe had a Zoom call with Pawel who had just moved back to GBG after a (miserable) year in Trondheim. And we got a new internet provider, which finally meant the end of random internet dropouts which had been especially annoying during online meetings. \n\nOne Saturday we went to a concert in Malm√∂. The trains got stopped at K√§vlinge and nothing continued for about 1.5 h. We cancelled our nice pizza restaurant reservation in Malm√∂ and went to a sushi place in K√§vlinge, until we could see the trains run again. Then continued on and made it in time for the concert. I had not realised how much I had missed going out and being among people in a dark, slightly shabby nightclub that smells of beer. It was great! The concert was great too - William Basinski, and pre-show was Elin Piel, both delivering very atmospheric synth music.\n\nI made my first pair of real trousers with a complicated fly zipper and fancy welt backpockets. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20trousers.jpg)\n\nI put up the Christmas decoration early, since it was so dark and grey outside.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20November%20-%20stra.jpg)\n\nWe got a new electric toothbrush (Sonicare!). brrrrr.\n\n\n### December\n\nAt the very beginning of December, Duncan stayed in a \"cabin in the woods\" in Tj√∂rnarp as a music retreat. Laika stayed with him, and I joined for the last two days. We had pizza at the only food place in town, which was only open once a week. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Nov%20-%20Tj√∂rnarp.jpg)\n\nIt was a bit wet and dark, so times for walks were limited. But we found many interesting mushrooms, hear many nice bird calls and even saw hair ice one morning! \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20hair%20ice.jpg)\n\nDuncan and I  joined the communications sub-group of Klimatavtal and had Lucia fika at our new friend Anna's place to talk social media strategy (and get to know each other). \n\nA card arrived that had been finding its way for more than 6 years! It had been sent in April 2015 by Mama and Papa. Someone from the Swedish postal service had corrected the address and it finally arrived, looking like a relic from hundred years ago. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20card.jpg)\n\nThen I got a big cold and stayed home for a few days, but always tested covid negative (even though my gurt squad colleague Kerstin had tested positive a few days earlier). Luckily, by the time I was supposed to go to Austria I was feeling fine again. Unluckily though, Mama and Papa tested positive, so I couldn't actually see them for this pre-Christmas visit. So it was \"only\" Angie, Chris and friends. We celebrated her 40th birthday partly at the Gl√ºhweinstandl and partly in a pub. While I was in Austria, it was snowy and -8C in Helsingborg, which I mostly missed unfortunately. Being on a plane again felt weird, but I do love the view of the clouds. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20Flight.jpg)\n\nAngie and I went to Josef Brot about 3 times, and ate Brot und Aufstriche for 90% of meals during the four days I was there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20Brot.jpg)\n\nOn the weekend before Christmas we watched Home Alone and ate lots of Christmas-y snacks from the British Shop that Ros had sent us. Christmas was pretty similar to last year: we had Austrian style dinner on the 24th, and then Tempeh Wellington on the 25th. This year, the holidays were placed pretty badly with 25th and 1st both being Sundays. But I took the whole mellandagarna off work to really enjoy all the boring things: reading, walking, cooking, sewing, coding, playing squash, etc. \n\nLaika had a bad stomach just before Christmas, so Duncan and I had to get up every few hours to take her out. Then during the mellandagarna she got increasingly reluctant to go outside, because of early fireworks. Poor girl. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/Xmas2022%20card%20Silfa%2001.png)\n\nAt the very end of the year, Duncan's new office chair was delivered. New Year's Eve was rainy and 10c. We watched Top Gun, played Spirit Island, ate pizza and cake, planned holidays for the year and were asleep by 00:30.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20chair.jpg)\n\nPlans for next year include 2 big walks (one in spring, one in autumn), a big 3-week summer holiday train travel through Europe (with Laika) and two retreats for Duncan (one in spring, one in late autumn). I would also like to go by train through Sweden a bit more (maybe Inlandsbana?), swim in lakes and the sea, go to Malm√∂ some more and stay happy.\n\n\n### Watched and listened\n- Star Trek: Picard\n- Star Trek: Lower Decks\n- Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. _SO GOOD!_\n- Star Trek TOS (Seasons 1+2 so far)\n- The Power of the Dog. _Award-winning western with Benedict Cumberbatch.

Most Sunday's I make 6 somewhat healthy bowls to have for lunches [Lunchboxes and Bowls](projects/cooking/Lunchboxes%20and%20Bowls.md). Having prepped lunchboxes is GREAT.\n- We had Laoganma tofu (with fermented vegetables) and [Yeung Man's Garlic Chili Noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG8KpOvN5V8\u0026t=366s) each about once a week. \n- Many evenings we watched restoration videos in bed. \n- Due to being in the \"gurt squad\", I have tasted SO MUCH (mostly plant-based) yogurt this year. \n- Visiting Fl√•m out of season (at the beginning of April) was amazing. We had the whole Fl√•mbana to ourselves and the village that is usually flooded by cruise tourists in summer was sleepy and deserted. The weather wasn't too bad either: nice snow in Myrdal and low-hanging clouds in the fjords down at sea level. Bergen was even sunny!\n- I continued to make a lot of fermentations and sew and repair many things. I made my first pair of proper trousers [Attitude trousers](projects/sewing/Attitude%20trousers.md), a self-drafted summer dress, a self-drafted summer skirt, and I designed a fabric to make a blouse for Angie's 40th birthday (which unfortunately didn't arrive in time). I also learned how to use the Overlocker. \n- I learned some new coding skills, mainly during my project of Gothenburg's street maps. I also learned how to use Github pages to set up a website, and started a [Digital Garden](https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden/) (via Quartz) that is also hosted on Github pages. And I worked through about 20 days of the 100 Days of Python course. \n- Malm√∂ and Copenhagen are both really cool places, once you get away from the shopping streets and the more touristy places. \n- I read several books in Swedish this year, listened to a lot of Spr√•ket and P3 Dokument√§r podcasts, joined the Matkooperativet community group meetings which were in Swedish, and survived the Oatly Technolgy Development Christmas get-together in Swedish. Still not 100% comfortably fluent, but getting there. \n- Fermentation wisdom of this year: Fermenting Brussels sprouts is delicious! So are celeric and carrot. When making chili ferments, wear gloves. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Fermentations.jpg)\n\n- Didn't quite manage to go winter swimming this year. But I did go swimming in the sea several times this year, including in the harbour at Pixlapiren. And it does get easier when going in. And it does feel amazing!\n- It's much better to stay at solid, simple hostels than supposedly fancy hotels that then disappoint.\n- Gimbap are a great hiking and picnic food: make a whole roll, cut into pieces without taking the roll apart and wrap tightly into aluminium foil or clingfilm. Super un-messy transportation and delicious when at room temperature. \n- Exciting science news this year were the release of AlphaFold and other AI protein structure prediction tools. Also, GPT-3 and ChatGPT were two language neural networks that blew everyone's mind with how good they are at generating text. For visuals generation with AI, Midjourney and Dall-e were two of the biggest things and started a big discussion about copyright and originality in art. COP27 in Egypt was a disappointment as expected. James Webb telescope was launched and delivered amazing new insights into cosmology. \n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:58.337439585Z","tags":null},"/private/Yearly-reviews/2022-Review/2023-plans":{"title":"2023 plans","content":"\n\nSee also [Personal canon](private/Cadence/Personal%20canon.md), [Cadence Review](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review.md)\n\n## Science\n- Keep up to date with scientific discoveries: Make time (2h/week) to read Science and Nature --\u003e book **Sunday afternoons** into the calendar.\n- Fermentation \u0026 biotechnology: \n\t- Plan it into the workweek to read papers and books, increase knowledge in these areas --\u003e book **Friday afternoons** into the calendar. \n\t- Continue to experiment at home with fermentations.\n\t- Pursue the fermentation visualization/database project (with Max).\n\n\n## Media \u0026 art\n- Read more solarpunk-related literature.\n- Go through inspiration folder and pinterest every once in a while.\n- Take the camera and take photos.

It was alright, but I was not interested to do the 24h thing, so I left in the evening and showed up again in the morning for breakfast and wrap-up. \n\n## February\n\nWe took the train to spend a weekend in Gothenburg and meet friends. After a winter in almost snowfree Helsingborg, it was wonderful to get a big load of snow on the first morning we woke up in GBG. Met Eva and Kennet in a cool bar in Majorna, then walked around Nya Varvet with Chris on the snowy morning. Had a few beers with Josh in a pub and joined a little party at Isak \u0026 Kallo's new place in Angered. \n\n![|](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231172815.png)\n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231172929.png)\n\n![|](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231173339.png)\nWe also went to a dogcaf√© with Gina, Bailey and her two kids. It was SO sweet and Laika met Bailey again :') \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231173107.png)\n\nDuncan went to a meditation and creativity retreat in R√∂st√•nga in Villa S√∂der√•sen (9-12 Feb). \nI made a cool pair of trousers, the [Shop Pants](projects/sewing/Shop%20Pants.md) (later on I extended the bottom a bit straight, so it wouldn't be quite so barrel-shaped).\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231173906.png)\n\nA nice view when walking up the stairs in our house in Helsingborg. \n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174027.png)\n\nAnd a nice view from our kitchen window in HBG.\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174118.png)\n\nSome days in February were very nice and sunny, but of course there were some cloudy and foggy days. Very moody, especially when walking through the nice gamla kyrkog√•rd near our home in HBG.\n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174255.png)\n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231174325.png)\n\nDuncan went to a synth meetups in Malm√∂ and I went along for the day to have lunch and go to some shops. We met a guy he knew in a department store (John, who had *just* gotten married) and in the evening Duncan attended a concert in a cellar club where there was a sitar player and some guy who said he knows a count who can get us an apartment in Malm√∂. In hindsight, that was probably the point when we (or at least Duncan) decided that he really wanted to move to Malm√∂. \nKlimatavtal organised a politician's debate and from each party one person actually showed up and joined the discussion about sustainable transport in Helsingborg. Was quite interesting. As member of the comms team, I filmed the whole thing and put info about it on social media. \n\n## March\nGot a haircut. Had a wonderful sunny day in early March in Copenhagen. I visited Jenny in her cute very Copenhagen apartment, walked around with Laika and then met up with Duncan (who had attended a modular meetup) for beers in the meatpacking district. \n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175021.png)\n\nDuncan got REALLY into Yogi tea. Got a little bit of snow in HBG. \nOn a fairly soggy day, we took train and bus to Dalby S√∂derskog to visit Sweden's smallest national park. \n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175300.png)\n\nI designed and made a sleeve for our ebook reader.\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175500.png)\n\nWe went to Malm√∂ again for a Niels Frahm concert in Moriska Paviljongen and ate at Arous Damaskus *again*. Good stuff. \nLaika got a fancy muzzle for the upcoming train trip through Europe, since many countries require it. \n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175649.png)\n\n## April\nI went to G√•seb√§ck film festival where I saw an interesting documentary about where the money for new oil exploration in the UK comes from. The festival was small but cool, and located in an industrial area. Nice to see that there are some things going on in HBG. Sad that no one I knew showed up (not even Klimatavtal people).\n\nI made Laika a relaxation landscape.\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231175906.png)\n\n\nOn 5 April we started our spring walk along Sk√•neleden from North to South. We started on a sunny morning at Vittsj√∂ train station and walked about 25-30 km each day, stopping on the way to H√§ssleholm, in H√§ssleholm, near Tj√∂rnarp (Jallahustruns), in H√∂√∂r, and then took the bus and train back from H√∂rby. We were super lucky with the weather; generally it was very pleasant, often sunny and relatively warm, but we also got some snow dusting on some mornings, which was magical when walking through the forest. So many nice moments on this walk, we barely met any other people. Next time, no more matmuffins. Duncan's vegan sausage rolls were a hit though. Laika walked like a champ, still pulling strong on the leash at the end of each day (though she slept pretty hard every night). \nAnother thing that I tried for the first time was taking the canicross leash. It worked really well! Great to have the hands free, and Laika usually had no problem walking in front and figuring out where the path went. \nRIP my orange puffer jacket that I had bought in the second hand shop and was perfect for the walk, but that I then washed after the walk, which completely destroyed it :( \n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231180354.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5803290326830529485-y.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231180624.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231180709.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231180717.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231180806.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231180830.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181050.png)\n\nGot a nice Easter care package from M\u0026P. Duncan and I had fondue at Chay, which is quite something. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181009.png)\n\nWent to Fredriksdal to look at the animals, including supercute new lambs.\nSpring had clearly arrived in HBG when we came back - flowers everywhere. The cherry blossoms were blooming around the library and in Furutorpsparken.\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181300.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181353.png)\n\nWe spent our anniversary weekend in Copenhagen, staying at a cosy Airbnb in Norrebro. Had potato pizza. Went to a Yo La Tengo show in an old (porn?) cinema. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181452.png)\n\nWe also went back to Tj√∂rnarp one Saturday to complete the last leg of Sk√•neleden, which we had skipped on our walk because it would've been too much for a day. Took the chance to eat again at this amazing pizza place in H√∂√∂r that we had discovered on our walk. \n\n## May\nWe saw the First of May parade from Sosserna walk past our window. Had pizzalunch outside in glorious spring weather - HBG showing itself from its best side.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231181856.png)\n\nAfter much nudging from Duncan I brought a (old model) Theromix home from work to test it out. Eurovision happened, and even though Finland was MUCH better, I'm not unhappy that Sweden won (yay, Loreen!). \nGot Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Switch. What a game.\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182329.png)\nIt got pretty warm halfway through May. I bought the first watermelon of the year and made loads of iced coffees with crushed ice in the Thermomix. Rapeseed fields all over Sk√•ne and tulips in Slottshagen were blooming. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182302.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182406.png)\n\nAt the end of May our 3 week train trip through Europe started!\nHelsingborg to Helsing√∂r by ferry, then train to Copenhagen and from Copenhagen to Kolding. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182529.png)\n\nWe visited the Miniby in Kolding, and a kind of botanical garden. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182631.png)\n\nThe next day we went to Hamburg and stayed over in hostel with a kind of Fritz Cola theme. Had fantastic Vietnamese food and walked through the Speicherstadt, but also found Hamburg - especially around the station - a bit unpleasant and crowded. \n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231182843.png)\n\nContinued to Osnabr√ºck, which we unexpectedly liked very much. It had nice houses and old buildings and was kind of cute. Lots of fair trade and alternative tea/yoga shops. I bought a baobab tree sapling for me and for Christian's upcoming birthday. Duncan bought a cool backpack made out of a car airbag and a seatbelt.\n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183131.png)\n\nNext day, train from Osnabr√ºck to Amersfoort, and then further to Utrecht. Very pleasant connection.\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183056.png)\n\nI loved Utrecht. The weather was great, the houses cute, the canals picturesque, the people all on bikes and the flowers next to the houses in full bloom. Duncan attended a conference for 2 days, and I mostly walked around with Laika. We had Indonesian food, breakfast in adorable caf√©s and good ice cream. \n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183524.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183725.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183504.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183644.png)\n\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183419.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183614.png)\n\n\n## June\n\nOn 2 June we continued onwards to Rotterdam, where we changed into a train to Brussels. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020231231183832.png)\n\nFrom Brussels to Luxemburg was a really pleasant, calm trainride through the south of Belgium - rolling hills and small forests, cool train carriage, PERFECT! But then just before the Luxemburg border we got put on a rail replacement bus that was really full and hot and unpleasant. Oh well.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112013.png)\n\nLuxemburg itself was great. Quite spectacularly placed city with a big ravine separating the old town from the more modern part. Free public transport. Fantastic pizza and ice cream. More German-feeling city than I had expected, but also very French. Weird mix. And the dialect sounds crazy, like a perfect mix of German, French and something else.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112150.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112337.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102112310.png)\n\nOnwards with the train to Koblenz, where we would catch our overnight train to Innsbruck. The train ride was very pleasant, going mostly along the Mosel river past vineyards and old castles. Then unfortunately we got stranded at a random train station again with no information about rail replacement services. One completely full bus left and bus driver couldn't tell us when or if there would be another one. So we just waited with a bunch of other confused people, hoping that there would be a bus in time to catch our connection in Koblenz. About half an hour later, a bus arrived and we got on it and arrived in Koblenz on time, only to see that our night train was massively delayed. Had a beer in a pub, then checked back - more delays. Spent some hours in the train station, but Laika was very unhappy there. Finally we checked into the cheapest hotel next to the station and set our timer for hour intervals to not miss the train updates. Finally, the train was completely cancelled at 3 am. Ugh. Managed to book us on a day train to Innsbruck leaving at 9 am. Met Duncan's parents at Innsbruck train station, then arrived in Fulpmes in the afternoon. Met up with Mama, Papa and Luna, and Angie and Chris the day after. \n\nWe went to a nice waterfall, and up the mountains in cable cars, and down the mountains in Sommerrodelbahn. We carried the dogs through cow herds, ate K√§sesp√§tzle and Topfenstrudl and drank holy spring water and Buttermilch mir Preiselbeeren. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113211.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113226.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113246.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113305.png)\n\nThe weather was generally really good, it only poured a few times. It was very nice to see family and to hang out together in the same place for a week after being on a train every day for the past week. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113355.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113404.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113437.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114727.png)\n\nAfter a week we said goodbye to Duncan's parents and Angie and Chris, and went to Zipf to spend another night there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113511.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113554.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113612.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113637.png)\n\nThen we took the train to Munich, stayed a night there, and continued on to Berlin for 3 nights. Munich was ok, Berlin was great. The only bad thing was the sticky stuff from all the linden trees that was caked on the pavement and stuck to Laika's paws and tail. But the food was great, Tempelhof was interesting in a very solarpunk way, we spent a morning bathing to gentle techno beats in Liquidrom, met up with Max Graze for food, chat and ice cream, and Duncan got new glasses.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102113940.png)\n\n ![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114004.png)\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114029.png)\n\nNext stop was L√ºbeck, where it was very warm. Pretty, old town centre and exciting to finally see the Holstentor in reality. Found a great Korean place and a nice Afghan place in a shady inner courtyard. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114219.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114232.png)\n\nThen we took a short bus to Travem√ºnde and embarked on the ferry to Malm√∂. Our cabin was very cosy and the trip was really restful. Slept great! And arriving in the morning under the √ñresundsbron was super cool!\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114338.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114347.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114415.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114430.png)\n\nWe spent midsommar with Luciane at Fredriksdal in Helsinborg. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114513.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114527.png)\n\nDuncan went to Norrk√∂ping for a sonification conference and really liked it there. \n\n## July\nPawel visited on his way back from Portugal-Sweden bike trip that he had started at the end of February, and brought Duncan some nice Lego for his 39th birthday.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114652.png)\n\nI got the tiniest tick in the world and fermented some unusual fruits from the Asian shop: bottle gourd and a green papaya. \n\nMax visited us in Helsingborg and we went to Fredriskdal and P√•lsj√∂ skog. Laika enjoyed some swims in the sea.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114856.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102114951.png)\n\nDuncan and I organised few walks for Klimatavtal, and we walked to R√•√• together with Luciane and her husband Amit. Met Margit there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115108.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115125.png)\n\nTried fermenting water melon rind, but that didn't turn out great. Made a [Donny shirt](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt.md). \nWe started looking actually for apartments in Malm√∂ and went to a few viewings. \nI went to Kouvola in Finland to do a trial for Oatly's gurt 2.0 at FFF. Lot of driving and waiting, long evening and a very early morning. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115348.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115415.png)\n\nChris visited us in Helsingborg and we went to Helsing√∂r and walked through Danish forests.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115530.png)\n\nGot nice Fairphone headphones and a customised Heinz ketchup bottle for my birthday. And we went for a nice lunch to Chay. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115626.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115638.png)\n\nThen we headed to R√∂st√•nga to spend a night in Villa S√∂der√•sen. Both to enjoy a weekend in the forest and to check out the place for a possible 40th birthday celebration next summer/autumn with our families. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115800.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102115807.png)\n\n\n## August\nI went to a viewing of an apartment in Malm√∂, was on spot 19 of the botplats queue initially, and for some miraculous reason we actually got it. Yay!\n\nBig storm and flooding of fox valley in HBG.\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120025.png)\n\nDuncan went for a weekend to Stockholm for a Norns coding workshop. \nWe went on another Klimatavtal field trip from Glumsl√∂v to Landskrona, and only two girls from a hiking in Sk√•ne facebook group showed up. Was still nice though.\n\nDuncan bought a bright red electric guitar on Blocket. \nLisi visited me at Oatly to present a glucose and maltose sensor. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120309.png)\n\nAt the end of August, Duncan left for a 2.5 week UK trip to visit family, Possible colleagues, go to Andrew Lewis' wedding and going to Wales to visit his relatives. He took the train via Brussels, which was a bit stressful because of German train problems and delays. \n\nPapa came to Helsingborg. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120510.png)\n\n\n## September\nPapa and I walked to R√•√•, P√•lsj√∂ skog and Sofiero, went to Lousiana museum, and spent a day in Malm√∂. We also cooked nice food and Papa helped fix some holes in the wall in preparation of moving out.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120607.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120615.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120648.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120728.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102120818.png)\n\nWhen Duncan came back from the UK, he got Covid and spent 10 days in bed, mostly in the bedroom. We successfully isolated from each other so I didn't actually catch it. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102161909.png)\n\nI got a nice fermentation tub from Duncan from the UK. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102162441.png)\n\nThe loquat seed I got from Pawel from Italy finally started sprouting.\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102162301.png)\n\n## October\nWe sold our grey IKEA Friheten sofa. Great sofabed, but 90% of the time we just used the chaise-longue, and we thought it was too chunky for the new apartment in Malm√∂.\nGot the keys to the apartment!\n\nWent on a Netherlands train trip with Mama (5-11 Oct). We met up in Osnabr√ºck and had a nice day there. We walked through the city, the botanical gardens, and visited an art gallery in a fomer church that had a lot of electronic trash piled up in big tubs. Mama was very interested in the motherboards, because she used to build them back when she worked at Eltrona. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102162659.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102162940.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102162957.png)\n\nOn the second day in late afternoon, we took the train to Amersfoort. Amersfoort is super cute, with a nice historical centre, a huge churchtower that we climbed (including a carillon that we got showed how to play), lots of shops and restaurants, people everywhere on foot and bike, and a vibrant market on a Saturday. We stayed in the Hotel de Tabaksplant and went out to eat in an Asian fusion restaurant that served us meat not once but *twice*, even though we had ordered from their vegan menu.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102163258.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102163530.png)\n\nWe took a daytrip to Rotterdam, where we looked at a lot of cool architecture (cube houses, Markthal, design museum) and did a boat tour around the port. I also bought a bright orange wholly hat. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102164220.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102164406.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102164302.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102164324.png)\n\nOn the next day we went to Den Haag and walked all the way past the International Court of Justice to Scheveningen beach. Had some vegan cake and coffee, and walked back.

I wasn't very happy with the state of the walls (lots of non-white fixed holes), but there was not enough time to paint everything before the big move. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102165739.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102165720.png)\n\nGot loads of apples from Kerstin's apple trees in Helsingborg.

Very nice autumn days, exploring Pildammsparken, going to Far i Hatten for pizza, Mitt M√∂llan for bento boxes, Scandwich for trendy sandwiches, Farina for amazing bread and the M√∂llev√•gnstorget market for fresh veggies. Also 500 times to Clas Ohlson to buy various hooks and sticky things and showerhead tube and boxes for cupboards, etc. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102170920.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171344.png)\n\nIt took me a while, but I bought a very nice pair of jeans from Nudie jeans. I also fixed all our curtains because the apartment in HBG had much higher ceiling and we needed to shorten the curtains. I also started a guitar course to learn how to play the electric guitar.\nMalm√∂ FF won the Swedish league and the fans walked right past our house.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171321.png)\n\nI bought a sofa at a second hand shop for 200 SEK, we got it transported home by a nice Syrian guy for another 350 SEK, the had pizza from 400 Grader on it. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171508.png)\n\nI went to the city library with Tessa and Konstantin. Isak \u0026 Buffy visited, and we went to Plan B to see some bands, including Arab Strap. A week later we went there again to see Subways and Ash. \nThen Mikael, Siri and Tage visited and we went to Mitt M√∂llan and Folkets Park. \n\nHad to go back to the HBG apartment several times for a flyttst√§d nightmare, because the Balder lady didn't approve how the st√§dfirma cleaned. In the end I fixed it myself. \nWe also went to Sofiero, which was very nice. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171803.png)\n\nGot an air purifier. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102171834.png)\n\nMet Carlos from our building and his Samoyed puppy Aurora for a playdate near Jesusparken.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102172002.png)\n\nIt snowed! A LOT! (28 Nov) We went for a walk at 10:30 pm around Pildammsparken just to enjoy the new fluffy snow. And it stayed really cold for 1-2 weeks, so the snow stayed on the ground for quite a while and it was wonderful. \n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102172122.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102172302.png)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102172328.png)\n\n## December\nLaika got little snow boots!\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102174130.png)\n\nWe went to Gothenburg for the weekend (mostly to pick up the Tubble, but also to see friends) and we got stopped SO much on the streets and shops just because of Laika's cute shoes. \nHung out with Chris, did a escape room board game and tried miracle berries with a load of sour things. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102172603.png)\n\nWe went to Eva \u0026 Kennet's Christmas party, then a morning walk around Lindholmen and lunch at Barley's with Scott, and ate dinner with Josh in a very nice place at Stigbergstorget (Skeppet). Eva and Kennet were the same as always, had just come back from Japan (which they didn't entirely love), Josh was over but maybe not really over Helen and talked a lot about Warcraft and his new job at RISE, and Scott and Aurora are appartently trying for a baby right now. We met Stefan \u0026 Sarah for lunch at Benne Pasta - Morgan had just turned 1 and they had moved to V√•gm√§stareplatsen. In the afternoon on Sunday we also hung out with Pawel, who had also started at RISE not too long ago and was grumpy that his Loquart seed had not sprouted as well as mine had. \nWe picked up the Tubble!\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173015.png)\n\nThen we had a partially horrible trainride back to Malm√∂ because Laika had had a bad stomach for the previous week, and around Halmstad she started shaking and panicky looking for a poop spot. I forbid Duncan to jump out of the train on the platform in Laholm and spent an hour with a continuously more frantic dog near the door until she finally pooped on a napkin (and partially on my hand). \n\nMalm√∂ was icy and cold and Stora Pildammen froze over completely (lost a bet to Duncan).\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173401.png)\n\nThen it got warmer again and all the ice and snow disappeared. We bought a Christmas tree and had fancy vegan 5-course Chinese dinner at Kin Long to celebrate my new job title (Principal Scientist in Enzyme and Fermentation Technology) and Duncan's award from the Dataviz Society for community engagement. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173453.png)\n\nGot cherry cheesecake at Konstantin's place because it was his 40th birthday (same birthday as Angie! 14 Dec). \nI tested Covid positive on 16 Dec after attending about 3 work Christmas gatherings the days before. Spent a few days in bed and a few more just at home. First time I've been sick off work since I started at Oatly. No fever, just headache and sore throat and a bit generally ill feeling. \n\nGot new chairs for the dinner table and a bamboo bench for the hallway.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173803.png)\n\nAs usual, Austrian Christmas dinner on 24 and British Christmas lunch on 25.\n![|500](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102173857.png)\n\nDuncan got a nice baseball cap, a fancy glass tea mug, bass equipment and an apple corer. I got a turquoise guitar amp, an e bow, invitations to several nice restaurants and a course at a pottery place nearby. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2023%20Review/photos/Pasted%20image%2020240102174054.png)\n\nTo avoid bangers and fireworks in Malm√∂ we booked a place in Skillingaryd in Sm√•land (28 Dec - 2 Jan). The train ride there was again less than ideal, because there were two cats on our 4-seater and Laika spent the whole 2 hours vibrating with adrenalin and trying to get closer to their transport boxes. \nWe had two days of rain in Skillingaryd, but then it snowed and cooled down at it was very nice to walk in the woods. Laika had bad stomach again for a day, but this time we just starved her for a day and fed her Canikur and that seemed to do the trick instantly. Duncan got a massive migraine on 30th, but was fine again on 31st. \nHappy New Year 2024!\n\n\n## Did\n\n\n\n## Read\n\n\n\n\n## Watched\n\n\n\n## Played\n\n\n\n## Goals for 2024\n- Kayak in Malm√∂\n- ","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:35:59.949450535Z","tags":null},"/projects/attachments/Plant-based-dairy-fermentation-notes":{"title":"","content":"\n2022, Harper et al.

The concept is also surprising._\n\n_As the author writes in the end notes:_ \"Back in the 1990s the physicist Kip Thorne was on a book tour, and I heard him give a talk in which he described how you could - in theory - create a time machine that obeyed Einstein's theory of relativity. I found it absolutely fascinating. Movies and television have encouraged us to think of time machines as vehicles you ride in, or else some kind of teleporter that beams you to different era. But what Thorne described was more like a pair of doors, where anything that goes in or comes out of one door will come out or go into the other door a fixed period of time later. Several questions raised by vehicular or transporter-style time machines - what about the movement of the Earth, why haven't we seen visitors from the future yet - were answered by this type of time machine. Even more interesting was the fact that Thorne had performed some mathematical analysis indicating that you couldn't change the past with this time machine, and that only a single, self-consistent timeline was possible.\"\n\n\n## Exhalation\nAn individual trying to figure out how their mind works and realises that everyone is a machine whose memories are dependent on air flow and entropy.\n\n_From the author's end notes:_ \"(Inspiration for this story came from) the chapter in Roger Penrose's book _The Emporer's New Mind_ in which he discusses entropy. He points out that therer's a sense in which it's incorrect to say we eat food because we need the energy it contains. The conservation of energy means that it is neither created nor destroyed; we are radiating energy constantly, at pretty much the same rate that we absorb it. The difference is that the heat energy we radiate is a high-entropy form of energy, meaning it's disordered. The chemical energy we absorb is a low-entropy form of energy, meaning it's ordered. In effect, we are consuming order and generating disorder; we live by increasing the disorder of the universe. It's only because the universe started in a highly ordered state that we are able to exist at all.\"\n[Quotes](Quotes.md)\n\n## What's expected of us\nA simple machine shows people that free will doesn't exist, and a warning from the future to never use it.\n\n\n## The lifecycle of software objects\nMore a novella than a short story, since it's quite lengthy. \n\nIn the near future, pet avatars are developed to work in virtual reality.

The education of a reluctant businessman (by Yvon Chouinard)\n\n_Read: January 2021_\n\nFounder of Patagonia details the beginnings of the company, how they grew and what the considerations were at all steps of the way. It's a very nicely comprehensive book of how to try to lead an as good company as possible, in terms of sustainability, work ethics, employer happiness and product quality. Also about the hurdles on the way and the problems of combining growth and production with environmental consciousness. Lots in there to aspire to, and it makes want to never work for a company that does not agree with these values. \nI didn't take as many notes as I wanted to, since I rarely had a pen nearby, but I will probably read the book again in the future. \n**Some take away messages:** Change is good, embrace it, don't stand still. It's more important to get people who share the philosophy than people who have a lot of knowledge (e.g. rather hiring a surfer to train them in accounting, than an accountant who would never ever surf). The best leadership is by example. Not buying a product in the first place is best for the environment. But if you buy one, use it as long as possible, repair it.\n\n\u003e If we could al come to see our customer products as tools that help us live our real lives - rather than as substitutes and surrogates for that life - we would need many fewer products to be happy. And we would keep the ones we already have for longer. (Naomi Klein) pXI\n\n\u003e When a problem comes up, the effective CEO does not immediately hire a consultant. Outsiders don't know your business the way you do, and anyway, I've found that most consultants come from a failed business.

The main characters all live in the same co-op building: two small orphans, an activist and politician, a police inspector, a finance bro, the facility manager, two quants/hackers, an influencer/animal rescuer, and an old professor. They do wildly different things - from digging up lost pirate gold to shipping polar bears to Antarctica to establishing a new real estate market. \n\n### + \nIt paints an interesting picture of a chaotic and realistic NY in the future, some parts a bit Venice-like, some parts derelict and rotting. It didn't seem entirely futuristic - besides some new hovercrafts and hints about new building materials it doesn't seem very different to New York 2023 (or 2017 when it was written). But it's a new perspective to imagine the time after the \"pulses\" where ice cap meltings and enormous floodings wreaked havoc on the world. The mix of charcters is also nice, I especially liked the scenes with the police inspector and the more exciting passages like the treasure hunt or the hurricane.  \n\n### - \nIt's a thick book, and it could easily be cut by half. There's a lot of \"babbling\" - dialogue between characters or inner monologues that just go on and don't really lead anywhere. Lots of references to things that make you feel a bit outside the clique. And the pacing was off for me; I wished that the plot was cut down to fewer things but those described better. Like there was a whole exciting plot about hackers being abducted and kept in an underwater container, and then they're just found, not really mentioned for half the book, and then it's just solved who kidnapped them. And of course fiction novels don't _need_ to be entirely realistic, but finding this pirate gold by just sucking up some dirt in a huge vacuum cleaner was just TOO unbelievable. Some other narrative strands were just never really taken up or resolved properly: there was a tense sene about a mob starting to enter a fancy skyscraper that's not really followed up later. I felt like I wanted to know more about where those stories went, instead of being inside the finance bros head again, thinking about if his investments into something \"real\" gets his crush back.

A person whose nature was genuinely unsociable had to get away from society and look after himself. He was completely free to do so. He could build himself a house wherever he liked (though if it spoiled a good view or a fertile bit of land he might find himself under heavy pressure from his neighours to move elsewhere).\n\n\n\u003eA long time later, he was awake. He could breathe. He was perfectly well. Everything was all right. He felt disinclined to move. To move would disturb the perfect, stable moment, the balance of the world. The winter light along the ceiling was beautiful beyond expression. He lay and watched it. The old men down the ward were laughing together, old husky cackling laughs, a beautiful sound.\n\n\n\u003eEven from a brother there is no comfort in the bad hour, in the dark at the foot of the wall.\n\n\n### Chapter 5\n\u003eHe worked at the Light Research Laboratories, read a great deal, and wrote three papers that summer and autumn: a productive half year, by normal standards. But he knew that in fact he had done nothing real.\n\n\n\u003eHe tried to read an elementary economics text; it bored him past endurance, it was like listening to somebody interminably recounting a long and stupid dream. He could not force himself to understand how banks functioned and so forth, because all of the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the money changers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal. \n\n\n\u003eAnd the strangest thing about the nightmare street was that none of the millions of things for sale were made there. They were only sold there. Where were the workshops, the factories, where were the farmers, the craftsmen, the miners, the weavers, the chemists, the carvers, the dyers, the designers, the machinists, where were the hands, the people who made? Out of sight, somewhere else. Behind walls. All the people in all the shops were either buyers or sellers. They had no relation to the things but that of possession. \n\n\n\u003e\"Nobody owns anything to rob. If you want things you take them from the depository. As for violence, well, I don't know, Oiie; would you murder me, ordinarily? And if you felt like it, would a law against it stop you? Coercion is the least efficient means of obtaining order.\"\n\n\n### Chapter 6\n\u003e\"You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them. By refusing to think, refusing to change. And that's precisely what our society is doing!\"\n\n\n\u003eIn the night one of them cried out aloud, dreaming.

The extravagance, the sheer quantity, of the storm exhilarated him. He reveled in its excess. It was too white, too cold, silent, and indifferent to be called excremental by the sincerest Odonian; to see it as other than an innocent magnificence would be pettiness of soul.\n\n\n\u003eHe had been fascinated from the start by the Urrasti habit of wrapping everything up in clean, fancy paper or plastic or cardboard or foil. Laundry, books, vegetables, clothes, medicines, everything came inside layers and layers of wrappings. Even packets of paper were wrapped in several layers of paper. Nothing was to touch anything else.

As the train swung in smoothly on a long viaduct the city rose up taller, brighter, solider, until suddenly it enclosed the train entirely in the roaring darkness of an underground approach, twenty tracks together, and then released it and its passengers into the enormous, brilliant spaces of the Central Station, under the central dome of ivory and azure, said to be the largest dome ever raised on any world by the hand of man.\n\n\n### Chapter 8\n\u003eThe validity of the promise, even promise of indefinite term, was deep in the grain of Odo's thinking; though it might seem that her insistence on freedom to change would invalidate the idea of promise or vow, in fact the freedom made the promise meaningful. A promise is a direction taken, a self-limitation of choice. \n\n\n### Chapter 10\n\u003eThey walked along side by side. The autumn stars had come out, incredible in number and brilliance, twinkling and almost blinking because of the dust stirred up by the earthquake and the wind, so that the whole sky seemed to tremble, a shaking of diamond chips, a scintillation of sunlight on a black sea. Under that uneasy splendor the hills were dark and solid, the roofs hard-edged, the light of the street lamps mild.\n\n\n\u003eThe days were utterly peaceful, in the autumn sunlight, in the silence of the hills.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/The-Ministry-for-the-Future":{"title":"The Ministry for the Future","content":"\n_Read: 2022_\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/The-Mountain-in-the-Sea":{"title":"The Mountain in the Sea","content":"![|300](projects/attachments/cover.jpg)\n_Read: March 2023_\n\nLoved it! It's not a long book, and I generally like when there's no unnecessary filling material in a book. When it doesn't drag on. This one was almost too short, especially towards the end I was wondering how they will wrap everything up (and it did feel slightly rushed towards the end). But overall a great book. Very pleasant, quite dry writing, and a good example of \"showing not telling\". For example when the characters use futuristic tech, like a kind of virtual mask that conceals your identity. Nothings _over_-explained. \n\nThe story is set in a slightly (?) dystopian, alternative world, where some of our current countries don't exist, but instead are split into city states and autonomous trade zones. The different storylines unveil that the world is run by mega corporations and AI, but there are also glimpses into the day-to-day of \"normal\" people that just use the tech that exists and lead their own happy lives.  \n\nI particularly liked the storyline with the AI trawler. A mega ship staffed with slaves and mercenaries, steered by an AI mind whose only goal is to comb the oceans for sea protein. Previously, these ships were run by robots, but the corporation owning the ships found out maintaining and repairing robots was much more costly than kidnapping humans and forcing them to catch, gut and freeze the fish they catch. I found it fascinating how this creepy ship is described, with it's plate-steel-protected wheelhouse and the AI mind lurking inside, continuously calculating fish stock prices, ocean currents and fish travel routes, and defending the ship from outside or inside forces with any means necessary. I guess it kind of falls into the sci-fi genre of \"_abandoned spaceship_\", which I love. \n\nThe other story lines are also interesting - environmental protection, drone warfare, hacking, linguistics, alien minds, conscious AI. \n\n## Some quotes from the book\n\n\u003e _The great and terrible thing about humankind is simply this: we will always do what we are capable of._\n\n\u003e Yes, guilt. It's a revenge fantasy. We are so ashamed of what we have done as a species that we have made up a monster to destroy ourselves with. We aren't afraid it will happen: We hope it will. We long for it. Someone needs to make us pay the price for what we have done. Someone needs to take this planet away from us before we destroy it once and for all. And if the _robots_ don't rise up, if our creations don't come to life and take the power we have used so badly for so long away from us, who will? What we fear isn't that AI will destroy us - we fear it won't. We fear we will continue to degrade life on this planet until we destroy ourselves. And we will have no one to blame for what we have done but ourselves. \n\n\u003e \"I was a nautical engineer, before all of this. This\" - He gestured around them, to the darkened, sweat-stinking barracks lurching in the storm. \"This world didn't exist. It was a story in the news. A story I clicked past without reading. Autotrawlers crewed by slave crews. Another world, a degraded shadow of our own. How was I to know there was a hole in the world that I could fall into, like falling through an open manhole? That I could fall right through that story in the news, and end up on the other side, on a planet I don't even recognize? And become a person I don't recognize.\" \"This was always there,\" Eiko said, \"underneath it all.\"\n\n\u003e _Given time, even the stones will flow._","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/The-Mushroom-at-the-End-of-the-World":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/Things-Become-Other-Things":{"title":"","content":"_Read: February 2024_\n\nThis book is a work of art, from the cover outside to the photos inside. The text is a finely crafted mix of autobiography, descriptions of walking along small coastal villages of Japan and its inhabitants. Every few pages, there are beautiful, high quality shots with a melancholic vibe of buildings and landscapes that Craig Mod encountered along the way, often with an interesting colour palette and a play of light and shadow. \n\n\u003e The owner said she never intended to own the place. But the guy she married turned out to be a nudnik, couldn't hold a job, and so she entered the kissa game. Took over this shop from someone else thirty years ago. That husband was long gone, but she kept at it, loved the work, loved the view. She was buoyant and chatty and her arms and legs had the subtle quality of a finely made marionette, shaking as if animated by the beating heart of some puppeteer above.\n\n\nThe whole thing is a bit melancholic, a bit wehm√ºtig for times gone. In his own personal life he describes a brother-like friendship that illuminated his rough childhood. And in the surroundings he's walking in, he describes the derelict coastal towns with aging populations and shuttered store fronts, where you still come across gems of people that lighten up your day.

The activity of art is to process the universe through the matrix of one's own being and then to express that experience into the world. Folks often choose not to live consciously and instead aggressively pursue activities and mind spaces that numb and mute any small voice of consciousness that might awaken their attention. Many are quite satisfied to respond to life with a series of default behaviors, opinions, and responses that have been collected and stored since childhood.\n\n\u003e By treating creativity like a daily process - like eating dinner or exercising - you will allow your mind to prepare for that time, thus making it feel more fruitful and methodical, as opposed to random and unexpected.\n\n\u003e How can you let your mind wander with purpose? _This_ is where listening can be our helpful field guide as we navigate creative endeavors. Listening is how our mind activates the fine-tuned aspects of perception that help us understand and decipher the world.\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/books_main":{"title":"Books main","content":"## Read 2024\n- All Systems Red - Murderbot Diaries #1 (Martha Wells)\n- [**Things Become Other Things**](projects/books/Things%20Become%20Other%20Things.md) (Craig Mod)\n- Jag √§r Zlatan (autobiography) (Zlatan Ibrahimovic)\n- Der beste Platz zum Leben (Anne Weiss)\n- De som inte syns (Micha Foss-Ghazarian)\n- Eine Geschichte der Welt in 100 Mikroorganismen (Florian Freistetter, Helmut Jungwirth, audiobook)\n- The Fabric of Civilization: How Textiles Made the World (Virginia Postrel)\n- [[The Hidden Life of Trees]] (Peter Wohlleben)\n\n## Read 2023\n- **[Exhalation](projects/books/Exhalation.md) (Ted Chiang)** \n- Children of Time (Adrian Tchaikovsky, audiobook)\n- Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes, audiobook)\n- **A Psalm for the Wild-Built (Becky Chambers)**\n- Hunder Jahre Einsamkeit (Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez)\n- **[[The Mountain in the Sea]] (Ray Nayler)** \n- Jade City (Fonda Lee)\n- The Birthday of the World and other stories (Ursula K.

Just put in a variable name instead of the `print` statement:\n\n1.  name = input (\"What's your name?\")\n\nSimilarly, if I want to turn the answer immediately into a different data type, I can do that together with the `input` command:\n\n`age =¬†int(input (\"How old are you?\")`\n\nUsually, inputs are strings, so if I just write:\n\n`name =¬†input(\"What's your name?\")`\n\nThe input value is stored as a string.\n\n### Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings\n`type()` Check the type of a variable, e.g. int, str\n`str()` Turn something into a string\n`int()` Turn something in to an integer\n`round()` Round a number to a specific number of decimal places, e.g. `round(3.5542, 2)`\n\n**F-string:** In front of a string (i.e. in front of the quotes) you type an `f`, then you can include different data types in curly brackets in the quotes. No need to doing `str()` or `int()`, etc.\n\n`print (f\"My weight is {weight} kg and my height is {height} m.\")`\n\n`variable =¬†variable + 1` is the same as `variable += 1`\n\nSame for -=, *=, /=\n\nE.g. `variable =¬†variable*2` is the same as `variable *=2`\n\n### Control flow and logical operators\n`if condition 1:`\n`    do A`\n`elif condition 2:`\n`    do B`\n`else: `\n`    do C`\n\n`\"Silvia\".lower()` --\u003e¬†\"silvia\"\n`\"Silvia\".count(\"i\")`¬†--\u003e¬†2\n\nUse three single quotes for writing multi-line strings:\n\n`print ('''This`\n`is a `\n`multi-`\n`line string`\n`''')``\n\n### Random module\nRandom number generation with the random module:\n\n`random.randint(1, 10) #Generates random integer between (and including)¬†1 and 10`\n`random.random() #Generates random float between (and including)¬†0 and (excluding) 1`\n\nPick a random item from a list:\n`random.choice(list_name)`\n\n_Don't try to learn every single function by heart. Instead, when you come across a new thing (e.g. a new data structure), read through the documentation to see what is possible. Then next time when you use it, you can look specific things up._\n\n**When importing modules:** \n\neither\n`import chosen_module`\n`print (chosen_module.sentence)`\n\nor\n`from chosen_module import sentence`\n`print (sentence)`\n\nor\n`import chosen_module as mod`\n`print (mod.sentence)`\n\nE.g. to import and use the Turtle class from the turtle module, either write:\n`import turtle`\n`new_turtle = turtle.Turtle()`\n\nor\n`from turtle import Turtle`\n`new_turtle = Turtle()`\n\nThe latter is useful when the class is used often and you don't want to type `turtle.Turtle()`¬†all the time.\n\nIt's also possible to import everything from a module and use it as if it was part of the normal environment (i.e. without the module name).\n`from turtle import *`\n\nThis however can be confusing, since it's often good to know which module a function belongs to.\n\nE.g.\n`choice([1,3,4])` looks confusing out of context. But if you write `random.choice([1,3,4])` it's much clearer that it is part of the random module and that a random number is picked from this list.\n\nFor long module names, it's also possible to use aliases:\n\n`import turtle as t`\n`new_turtle = t.Turtle()`\n\n### Lists\n**Lists** store data in a specific order\n`fruits =¬†[\"Cherry\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"]`\n\nTo access a specific entry from the list:\n`fruits[0]` or `fruits[-1]`\n\nTo add an item to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append(\"Melon\")`\n\nTo add several times to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append([\"Strawberry\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"]`\n\n`random.choice(list)`\nThis generates a random choice from a given list.\n\n`str.split()`\nSplits a string into separate components based on some defined divider, e.g. a comma.\n\n`str.split(\",\")`\nThe result will be a **list** that contains the separate components of the string.\n\nNested lists contain **lists of lists**. When addressing a specific item in a nested list, you have to first pick the right nested list, then the item in that list, e.g. the first item in the first list would be:\n`print (list([0][0])`\n\nTransform a string into a list:\n`list(string)`\n\n**in**\n\nThe **in** construct is an easy way to test if an element is contained in a collection, e.g. in a list.\n\n`list = [\"Silfa\", \"Duncan\", \"Laika\"]`\n`if \"Silfa\" in list:`\n`    print (\"yay\")`\n\n### Loops\n`letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`   print (letter)``\n\nNB:¬†The item (here `number`)¬†in a for loop does **NOT** count from 0 to i, but instead takes the value of the first item in the list (e.g. `\"a\"`)¬†and takes on that value. This means, that to have some kind of **counting variable** that is first set to 0 (outside the loop)¬†and then increases with each round inside the loop, you have to do the following:\n`count = 0`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`    print (letter)`\n`    count += 1``\nThen with each round through the loop, `count` will increase by 1, and will in the end have the same value as items in `letters`.\n\nFor loops are often used to loop through lists, but you can also loop through ranges of items that are not lists.\n\n**for loops and the** `**range()**` **function**\n\n`for number in range (a, b):`\n`    print (number)`\n_NB:¬†a is included, b is not_\n\nThe step size can also be changed, e.g. to increase the numbers by 3, type:\n`range(1, 100, 3)`\n\n**So there are 2 types of for loops:**\ntype 1\n\n`for item in list _of_items:`\n`    #do something to each item`\n\ntype 2\n`for number in range(a,b):`\n`    #do something``\n\n**_When to use a for and when a while loop?_**\n\n**For** loops are great when you iterate over something, and you want to do something with each thing you iterate over. E.g. iterating through a list.\n\n  \n\n**While** loops are used when you just want to carry out some sort of functionality many times until a condition is met. Don't care about what number in a sequence you're in, which item in a list you're iterating through, etc.\n\nWhile loops are a bit more dangerous than for loops. In for loops you always have an upper bound, but while loops will continue running until the condition evaluates to `FALSE`. That can lead to infinite loops.\n\nA good thing to do when you don't know why you get an infinite loop, simply `print()` the condition inside the loop and check what's happening.\n\n**While loop**\nA loop that keeps on going while a condition is `TRUE`.\n\n`while something_is_true:`\n`    #do a thing, then test the condition again, etc.`\n\nOnce the condition evaluates to FALSE, the while loop is skipped.\n\nExample of how a while loop can be used:\n`count =¬†6`\n`while count \u003e 0:`\n¬† ¬† ¬† `print (\"Hello!\")`\n¬† ¬† ¬† `count -= 1¬† ¬†#this decreases the` `number of counts by one every time` `the loop runs`\n  \nWhile loops can also be used while a condition is `FALSE`. For that, use this syntax:\n\n`while not some_condition_that_is_true:`\n`    #do something`\n\nThis means the loop runs while the condition is `FALSE`, but as soon as it evaluates to `TRUE`, we drop out of the loop.\n\nA good way to **include a check in a while loop** is to set a variable to `True` (or `False`) before the while loop starts. Then set the while loop to run WHILE¬†the `variable == True`. Inside the while loop, something makes the variable either remain `True` or switch to `False`. In case of False, the while loop will stop.\n\nA good way to **increase something or build something up in a For loop** is to set an empty string or an empty list outside of the for loop first. Then inside the for loop, in every turn something is added to the string or list, adding up to the final string or list when the for loop is finished.\n\n### Dictionaries\nDictionaries are useful if you want to associate labels with each value. Lists are better if you are storing similar data, such as a list of proces or names, where you cannot label each value.\n\n`dictionary1 = {`\n`   key1: value1,`\n`   key2: value2,`\n`   key3: value3,`\n`   }\n\nTo get a value back:\n`dictionary1[key2]`\n\nTo add an entry to the dictionary:\n`dictionary1[key4] =¬†value4`\n\nSimilar to lists and strings, it's often useful to start with an _empty_ dictionary, and then later on add to the dictionary.\n`dic_new =¬†{}`\n\nWhen looping through a dictionary, usually the **key** will be picked out:\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`   print (key)`\n\nIf you want to access a specific **value** in a dictionary (e.g. when looping through the dictionary):\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`    print (dictionary1[key])``\n\n**Nested dictionaries**\nThe nested dictionaries don't need to be the same size as the outer dictionaries. They can also include lists, strings, numbers, etc.\n\nLists are ordered and are accessed by the position inside the list. Dictionaries are NOT ordered.\n\nDictionaries (or lists)¬†are like folders. They can contain values, but they can also contain other dictionaries (or lists).\n\nA **_dictionary that contains a list_** looks like this:\n\n`travel_log = {`\n`   \"France\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"],`\n`    \"Germany\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n`    }`\n\n  \nA **_dictionary that contains a dictionary_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = {`\n      `\"France\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], \"total_visits\": 12},`\n      `\"Germany\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"], \"total_visits\": 5},`\n`}`\n\nAnd a **_list that contains dictionaries_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = [`\n`{`\n`\"country\": \"France\", `\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], `\n`\"total_visits\": 12,`\n` },`\n` {`\n`\"country\": \"Germany\",`\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n` \"total_visits\": 5,`\n` },`\n` ]`\n\nTo get **values** from a dictionary, type the variable for the dictionary, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[\"name\"]`\n\nTo get the **keys** from a dictionary, you can turn the keys into a list, and then refer to an item in this list. NB: items in a list are ordered, while items in a dictionary are not!\n`keys_list =¬†list(dictionary)`\n\nTo get **values from a dictionary of lists**, type the variable for the dictionary, the index of the entry in question, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[0][\"name\"]`\n\n#### Generate dictionary from a list\nSeveral options:\n- `dict.fromkeys()` Used to create a dictionary from a list. It accepts a list of **keys** that you want to turn into a dictionary. Optionally, you can specify a value you want to assign to every key. You cannot set individual values for each item in the dictionary. \n\tE.g. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict.fromkeys(fruits, \"In stock\")`\nIf we did not specify a value in our code, the default value for the keys in the dictionary would be `None`. \n- Dictionary comprehension: Creates a new dictionary from an existing list. You can specify different valuues for each key in the dictionary. \n\tE.g.\n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]` \n\t`fruit_dict = { fruit: \"In stock\" for fruit in fruits }\n\tThe dictionary comprehension runs through each item in the list `fruits`. We then add an item to our new dictionary for each fruit in our list. \n- `zip()` Converts (merges) two or more lists into a list of tuples. You can use the `dict()` method to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary. This way, one list can become the keys of the dictionary, and the other the values, e.g. if you have one list with fruits, and the other with the price of these fruits. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`prices = [3.5, 4.0, 2.1]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict(zip(fruits, prices))`\n\n#### Loop (iterate) over a dictionary\nDictionaries contain an `__iter__()` method that iterates over the keys. this method is automatically called when you put a dictionary into a `for` loop.\n`for key in a_dict: print (key)` \n\nIf you want access to the values, use the indexing operator `[]` with the dictionary and its keys:\n`for key in a_dict: print (a_dict[key])`  \n\nWhen you're working with dictionaries, it's likely that you'll want to work with both the keys and the values. One of the most useful ways to iterate through a dictionary is by using `.items()`, which is a method that returns a new view of the dictionaries items. It's a dynamic view, meaning that if the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. \nViews can be iterated over to yield their respective data, so you can iterate through a dictionary in Python by using the view object returned by `.items()`: \n`for item in a_dict.items(): print(item)`--\u003e returns tuples of the key-value pairs\n\n\nIf you just need to work with the keys of a dictionary, then you can use `.keys()`, which is a method that returns a new view object containing the dictionary's keys. To iterate through a dictionary by using `.keys()`, you just need to call `.keys()` in the header of a `for` loop:\n`for key in a_dict.keys(): print (key)` \nSimilarly, you can use `.values()` to iterate through values. \nBoth `.keys()` and `.values()` can be used to check if a key or value is present in a dictionary by using `in`: `\"apple\" in a_dict.values()`. \n\n#### Modifying values and keys\nYou'll need to use the original dictionary! \n\n#### Filtering items\nSometimes you'll want to create a new dictionary from an existing dictionary, that only stores the data that satisfies a given condition. You can do this with an `if` stateent inside a `for` loop:\n`a_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4}``\n`new_dict = {}`\n`for key, value in a_dict.items():`\n`if value \u003c= 2: new_dict[key] = value`\n`#new_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\", 2}` \n\n\n### Tuples\n`my_tuple =¬†(1, 2, 3)` --\u003e similar to list\n\nItems in a tuple are ordered (as in a list) and are accessed by indexing with square brackets.\n\nWhat's the difference from a list?¬†A tuple's values can't be changed once it's created (i.e. **_immutable_**).\n\nWhen do you want to use a tuple?¬†When creating something that shouldn't be changed or is protected from accidental change (e.g. the colour scheme of a website).\n\nWhen you want to change a tuple's values, you can convert it into a list by writing:  \n`list(my_tuple)`\nand then you can change the values as you would in a list.\n\n**Creating tuples:**¬†\n`new_tuple =¬†(first_item, second_item, third_item)`\n--\u003e separated by commas, and in round brackets\n\nTo access tuples, use same notation as for lists:\n`new_tuple[0] #first_item`\n\n\n## Functions\n**Functions**\nPython has built-in functions, e.g. `int()`, `range()`, `print()` or `round()`.\n\nCreating your own functions:\n`def my_function():`\n¬† `¬† ¬† ¬† content of function`\n\nTo call the function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**Functions with inputs**\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`    #Do this with something`\n`    #Then this `\n`    #And finally this with something`\n\nA function can have several parameters:\n`def my_function (param1, param2):`\n\nThis called **positional arguments**\n`def my_function (a, b, c):`\n`    #Do this with a`\n`    #then do this with b`\n`    #then this with c`\n\nIn comparison with keyword arguments the order doesn't matter. When a function is called, the name of the parameter is used, together with the argument for it:\n\n`my_function (a=1, b=2, c=3)`\n\nSince order doesn't matter, we could also write:\n\n`my_function (b=2, c=3, a=1)`\n\n**_Functions with outputs_**\n\nCan be simple or take inputs (arguments). Inside the function, the keyword `return` is used to \"transfer\"¬†a result/output to the _outside_ of the function, so it can be used further.\n\n`def my_function():`\n`result = 2*3`\n`return result`\n\nAfter the `return` keyword, the function is exited, and anything that would come after the `return` keyword in the function will not be executed. This can be used to return the function early if needed (e.g. check with an `if` statement if some condition is true, and then just use the `return` keyword to exit out of the function).\n\n**Different types of functions:**\n  \n**_Simple functions_**\nVery simple, without any parameters. Just reduced complexity by reducing the amount of code you need to write (e.g. if there is a recurring task).\n\n`def my_function():`\n`#do this`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**_Functions with inputs_**\nFunctions with parameters take an input that gets passed into the function when the function is called. This allows us to modify what the function does, depending on what input was passed in.\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`#do this with something`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function(123)`\n\n\n**_Docstrings_**\nWith docstrings, you can include a comment or little explanation with your newly created function about what it does and what it takes as input. Docstrings must be placed in the first line of the function and have to be encased in triple quotation marks. They can run over several lines.\n\n`def some_function(a, b):`\n`\"\"\"This function takes inputs a and b and does something to them, `\n`returning something else.\"\"\"`\n\n**Keyword arguments**\nEspecially for functions you haven't written yourself, it's really useful to write keyword arguments instead of positional arguments when calling the function.\n\nWith keyword arguments, you specify which argument you are referring to.\n`def function1 (a, b, c):`\n`#some function text`\n`function1(a=13, b=44, c=0)`\n\n**Recursion** \n=¬†calling a function inside itself\nYou can also take the output of one function call as an input for another function call. This is very useful for complex functions.\n\n**Useful functions:**\n\n`sum([list])` gives a sum of all items in the list\n`random.choice([list])` picks a random item from a list (requires to import the random package first)\n\nGlobal variables are by convention written in all caps.\n\nTo exit a function, simply use the `return` keyword.\n\n**Higher order function**\nA function that can work with other functions. E.g. it can take another function as an input and work with it inside the body of the function.\n\nWhen passing a function as an argument to another function, don't use the paranthesis at the end. E.g.\n`function_a (function_b)`\n\n\n## Debugging\n1. Describe the problem\n2. Reproduce the bug\n3. Play computer\n4. Fix the errors\n5. Print is your friend\n6. Use a debugger\n7. Take a break\n8. Ask a friend\n9. Run your code often\n10. Ask Stackoverflow\n\nTo access and change a global variable inside a local environment, e.g. a function, you have to write `global` + variable name first.\n\nFor example:\n`some_variable = 4`\n`def increase_something():`\n`global some_variable`\n`some_variable += 1``\n\n\n## Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n**OOP analogy:**\n\u003eYou come to a foreign country and don't know the language, don't know the city and don't have local money, but you want your clothes dry-cleaned. Instead of doing it yourself, you ask the hotel staff to do it, who know the language, the city and have local money.\n\n`hotel.dry_clean_clothes()`\n\n\nObjects have things they HAVE¬†and things they DO.\nThings they HAVE =¬†**_attributes_**\nE.g.\n`is_holding_plate = True`\n`tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]`\n\nThings they DO =¬†**_methods_**\nMethods are functions specific for an object\nE.g.\n`def take_order(table, order):`\n`#takes order to chef`\n`def take_payment(amount):`\n`#add money to restaurant``\n\n### Classes\nClasses are _blueprints_ for objects.\nClasses are usually written in Pascal case, i.e. every word beginning is capitalized\nE.g.\n`car =¬†CarBlueprint()`\n\nTo leave a class or function empty (for now), you can use the keyword `pass` to avoid \"indent error\" messages.\n\n#### init function\n**Constructor** =¬†part of the class that specifies what should happen when our object is constructed (= initializing an object). Variables and counters are set to their starting values.\n\nUse special function `__init__ (self)` to initialize the attributes.\n\nThe init function is going to be called every time a new object from this class is created.\n\nIn addition to the parameter self, there can be as many parameters as you want in the brackets after __init__. These parameters get passed in when a new object is constructed. These parameters can then be used to set an object's attributes.\n\n\nTo have a default value for an attribute, instead of setting it equal to one of the parameters of the init function, set it to a value in the init function (not the parameters!).\n\ne.g.\n`def __init__ (self, user_id, username):`\n`self.user_id = user_id`\n`self.username = username`\n`self.followers = 0`\n\nThis way the new object has new_object.followers set to 0 by default.\n\nExample of init function:\n`class Car:`\n`def __init__(self, seats):`\n`self.seats = seats`\n\nThe number of seats specificied when a new object of this class is initialized gets passed to that object as an attribute.\n\n`new_car =¬†Car(5)` --\u003e this will set the attribute new_car.seats to 5.\n\nThere can be many parameters in the init function. However, it means that whenever you create a new object from this class, you MUST¬†provide all these pieces of information for the new object.\n\n#### Making a new class\n`class User:`\n`#add functions, etc.`\n\n`user_1 =¬†User()`¬†to make a new instance of the class\n\n`user_1.username =¬†\"Silfa\"` to create a new attribute for the object. An attribute is a variable that is associated with an object.\n\nBut for attributes that all new instances should have in common, it's better to include them in the constructor.\n\n#### Methods in classes\nMethods = what the object DOES, i.e. a function that the object has.\n\nMethods can use `self.` attributes of objects.\n\nTo call the method, use the normal dot notation with brackets after the method, e.g.\n`user_1.start_game()`\n\nMethods in classes always need to have a `self` parameter as the first (and sometimes only)¬†parameter. This means that when the method is called, it \"knows\" the object that called it.\n\n`def new_method(self):`\n`self.followers += 1`\n\nThe `self` keyword is a way to refer to the object that is being created from a class.\n\nWe can use the class name inside an object to tap into the class.\n\nFor example we can create a list of objects by initiating new instances of a class inside a loop and filling a list with these new objects. These objects have all the attributes that are defined in the class constructer, and these attributes can be accessed with dot notation.\n\n\nWhen inside a class, and calling one of the functions inside one of the other functions, you have to use `self.` before the function name.\n\nE.g.\n`def function_using_another_function(self, input, something):`\n`self.previous_function(attribute1, attribute2)`\n`...`\n\n\nDifferent **instances** of classes can have different **states**. E.g. Turty and Timmy can be different instances of the class Turtle(), and they can have different states, e.g. `turty.color = green` and `timmy.color = purple`. \n\n## Interesting modules and other things\n\n**colorgram** is a Python library that lets you extract colours from images.\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/AlphaFold":{"title":"AlphaFold basics","content":"\n[What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution (Nature News)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5)\n\n[ColabFold: Making protein folding accessible to all (Nature Methods)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01488-1)\n\n\n## Original AlphaFold paper\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2\n- First computational method (neural network-based model AlphaFold) that can regularly predict protein structures from amino acid sequence alone, with atomic accuracy, even in cases in which no similar structure is known. \n- Novel machine learning approach incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure. AlphaFold network directly predicts the 3D coordinates of all heavy atoms for a given protein using the primary amino acid sequence and aligned sequences of homologues as inputs.\n- AlphaFold is trained on protein chains in the PDB released before 2018-04-30. \n- All-atom accuracy of AlphaFold in the CASP14 competition was 1.5 √Ö (1.4 √Ö is the width of a carbon atom). \n\nThe AlphaFold pipeline:\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023095944.png)\n\n- **Confidence measure = pLDDT**(predicted local-distance difference test).\n- Limitations: Model uses MSAs and the accuracy decreases substantially when the median alignment depth is less than around 30 sequences. AlphaFold is also much weaker for proteins that have few intra-chain or homotypic contacts compared to the number of heterotypic contacts; this occurs typically for bridging domains within larger complexes in which the shape of the protein is created almost entirely by interactions with other chains in the complex. \n\n## AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\nhttps://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/\n\n- **Search**: search for queries based on protein name, gene name, UniProt accession or organism name. (Currently no BLAST/sequence-based searching supported, but you can use hte EBI Protein Similarity Search tool to seach AlphaFold DB based on a query sequence)\n- Currently (as of July 2022) includes most of UniProt 2021_04 release, as well as proteomes of 20 model organisms and 48 complete proteomes. That means in total almost 215 Mio structures. Sequences that are not covered include ones that contain non-standard aas, are \u003c16 aas or \u003e2700 aas, and viral proteins. If your sequences aren't included you can generate your own AlphaFold predicitions using DeepMind's [AlphaFold Colab notebook](projects/coding/AlphaFold.md#AlphaFold%20Colab%20notebook). \n\n### Example of structure page\n\n#### General structure and confidence\n3D viewer: shows overall structure and confidence (pLDDT score; 100 = best, 0 = worst) in different parts of the structure. pLDDT \u003e 90 are suitable for applications that require high accuracy, e.g. characterising binding sites. pLDDT \u003c 70 should be treated with caution, and pLDDT \u003c 50 should not be interpreted (shown as only a ribbon-like structure); these regions are often either unstructured in physiological conditions or only structured as part of a complex. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023102704.png)\n\nClick on aas in the sequence to zoom in and see side chains:\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023102819.png)\n\nNB: PDB and mmCIF files that are downloadable contain coordinates for all regions, regardless of pLDDT score! It's up to the user to interpret the model judiciously . \n\n\n#### Relative position of domains\nPredicted alignment error (PAE) is necessary to assess the confidence in the domain packing and large-scale topology of the protein:\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023103017.png)\n\nColour at (x, y) indicates AlphaFold's expected position error at residue x if the predicted and true structures were aligned on residue y. Low = good. If the PAE is high for residue pairs x, y from two different domains, then the relative positions and/or orientations of these domains in the 3D structure are uncertain and should not be interpreted. \n\nPAE info can be downloaded as JSON file.\n\n### What AlphaFold does not support (yet)\n- Intrinsically disordered or unstructured regions\n- Effects of mutations. In particular, AlphaFold is not expected to produce an unfolded protein structure given a sequence containing a destabilising point mutation. \n- Multiple conformations of a protein. AlphaFold usually only produces one of them. \n- Predictions of positions of any non-protein components (e.g. cofactors, ligans, ions, post-translational modifications, DNA/RNA, metals, etc.). However, coordinates are often consistent with the expected structure in the presence of ions or cofactors. \n\n\n### Citing  \u0026 Licence\nIf you use an AlphaFold DB prediction in your work, please cite the following papers:  \n  \n[Jumper, J _et al_.

Course overview + the shell \nhttps://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/\n\n`~` is short for _home_\nType `date` to print (display) the current date and time. \n\n`echo`... Print commands with arguments, e.g. `echo \"Hello Silfa\"` --\u003e prints \"Hello Silfa\" on the screen.\n\n`echo $PATH` --\u003e Prints the directories the should should search for when given a command. \n\nWe can find out which file is executed for a given program using the `which` command, e.g. `which echo` shows where the file for the echo command is located (in my case, it results in \"shell built-in command\").\n\n#### Navigating the shell\nPath directories are separated by `/` on Linux and macOS and `\\` on Windows. \n\nA path that starts with `/` is called an _absolute_ path. Any other path is a _relative_ path (i.e. relative to the current working directory).\n\n`pwd` ... print working directory\n\n`cd` ... change directory \n\n`ls` ... shows list of current directory. With `-l`, list files in long format, i.e. with permissions.\n\n`mv` ... move/rename a file\n\n`cp` ... copy a file\n\n`mkdir`... make a new directory\n\nIn a path, `.` refers to the current directory, and `..` to its parent directory. So `cd ..` moves you \"downwards\" a level of directories.\n\nMost commands accept flags and options (i.e. flags with values) that start with `-` to modify their behaviour. \n\n`--help` or `-h` in addition to command name will print some help text, e.g. `ls --help`. \n\nFile permissions: list with `ls -l`\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221009103057.png)\nd = \"missing\" is a directory.\n\nFirst block of 3 characters: owner of the file; then users; then everyone else. So, `rwx` = read, write and execute (search) access; `r-x` = only read and execute access. \n\nIf you want more information about a command's or program's arguments, inputs, outputs, or how it works in general, try the `man` (= manual) program, e.g. `man ls`. \n\n**In terminal, press q for quit!**\n\n#### Connecting programs\nInput stream \u003c program \u003e output stream\n\nUsually the input and output streams are the terminal, but that can be rewired.\n\n`echo hello \u003e hello.txt` creates a text file containing the word _hello_. \n\n`cat hello.txt` prints the contents of the hello.txt file to the screen. `cat` concetenates and prints files (usually to the standard output, unless otherwise stated). \n\n`cat \u003c hello.txt \u003e hello2.txt` prints the content of the hello.txt file (input, `cat \u003c hello.txt`) to the hello2.txt file (output; `\u003e hello2.txt`). \n\nYou can also use `\u003e\u003e` to append to a file. The pipe operator `|` lets you \"chain\" programs such that the output of one is the input of another:\n\n#### Root user\nRoot user is above (almost) all access restrictions and can create, read, update and delete any file in the system. It's very easy to accidentally break something as the root user, so you will not usually log into your system as root user. Instead, you will be using the `sudo` command. It lets you do (`do`) something as superuser (`su`). _But make sure you double-check that you really want to do it that way!!_\n\nWhen you get permission denied errors, it's usually because you need to do someting as root.\n\n#### More commands\n\n`touch` ... Change file access and modification times. If file does not exist, it is created with default permissions. \n\n`chmod` ... Change file modes or access control lists.\n\n`curl` ... Enables data transfer over various network protocols, suchas ftp, http, https, pop3, etc. It communicates with a web or application server by specifying a relevant URL and the data that needs to be sent or received. `--head` fetches the header only. `--silent` Silent or quiet mode that won't show progress meter or error messages.\n\n`date` ... Display or set date and time. If combined with `-r` and a filename, the date and time of the last modification of filename is returned.\n\n##### Exercises\n1. Check that you're running an appropriate shell: `echo $SHELL` --\u003e `/bin/zsh`, so everything looks good. \n2. Create a new directory called \"Missing Semester\": `mkdir \"Missing Semster\"`\n3. Use `touch` to create a new file called \"semester\": `touch semester`\n4. Write the following (line by line) into the file semester: \n```\n#!/bin/sh\ncurl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu\n```\n Use single quotes for the first line!! # starts a comand in Bash, and ! has a special meaning, even with double quotes.\n5. `echo '#!/bin/sh' \u003e semester`\n6. `'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' \u003e semester`\n7.

Run the command by explicitely starting the `sh` interpreter and giving it the file semester as the first argument: `sh semester`. \n\nWhy does this work, but `./semester` didn't?\n_sh is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. I already have permission to execute sh, so it can run the semester script without problems. On the other hand, I don't have rights to execute the semester script directly._\n\n9. Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than having to type `sh semester`.\nChange the executing rights with `chmod +x semester.sh`. \n\n11. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? \n\n_The purpose of the shebang (`#!`) line is to tell the operating system (or whatever process launches the interpreter) what to use as the interpreter. _\n\n11.

The interface are the connection points between different modules; there's some _internal_ stuff going on inside the module, and some _public_ stuff that is shared with other modules. \n\nSee also: [[JS Packages]], [[JS npm]]\n\nWhy modules:\n- To not have to code everything from scratch if you want to use something repeatedly. \n- To manage complexity.\n- To have a \"LEGO\" system of code pieces that can interact through well-defined connectors. \n\nThe relations between modules are called _dependencies_ (i.e. a module _depends_ on another module). Dependencies are the other modules that a module makes use of.\n\n_Think about how to structure your code and what should maybe go into modules after you have done most of the coding, not during. _\n\nIf we want to make dependency relations part of the code, we'll have to take control of **loading dependencies**. Doing that requires being able to execute strings as code. \nFor that, we use the `Function` constructor. It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names, and a string containing the function body. \n\n```\nlet plusOne = Function(\"n\", \"return n+1;\");\nconsole.log(plusOne(4));\n// 5\n```\n\n\n**`require`**\nWhen you call this function with the module name of a dependency, the module is loaded and returns its interface. Modules automatically get their own local scope. All they have to do is call `require` to access their dependencies and put their interface in the object boud to `exports`.\n\nUsually modules have their dependencies on the top, e.g.\n```\nconst ordinal = require(\"ordinal\");\n```\nCalling `require` involves reading the module's code, wrapping it in a function and calling it. \nIt's usually written as a filepath, e.g. `\"./format-date\"` (i.e. the file `format-date.js` in the same directory). \n\n**`exports`**\nThe module adds its interface function to `exports` so that modules that depend on it get access to it, e.g. \n```\nexports.formatDate = function(date, format) {......};\n``` \n\n**`module`**\n\n## ECMAscript modules\nSince 2015, there's a new standard, that's however slow to be widely adopted. It uses **`import`** instead of `require` to acess a dependency, and **`export`** instead of `exports` to export things. \n```\nimport ordinal from \"ordinal\";\n\nexport funciton formatDate(date, format) {......}\n```\n\nIt's possible to rename imported bindings using the word **`as`**:\n`import {days as dayNames} from \"date-names\"; `\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing your own modules, find out what data structures people are usually using and follow their example, if possible. \n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Packages":{"title":"JS Packages","content":"\n## Packages\n\n_Packages_ enable you to build a program out of separate pieces or run these pieces on their own, and also apply the same pieces in different programs. \nA _package_ is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed) on its own.

Create an .html file, specifying in the `\u003chead\u003e`: `\u003clink href=\"CSS/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\u003e`\n2. Create the `style.css` file and specify the style of various parts of the html document. \n3. To show both windows (html + css) next to each other in Visual Studio Code, right click on one of the files in the Explorer section and select Open to the side.\n\n__To run the website in your browser (from Visual Studio Code), click Terminal \u003e New terminal and then type live-server into the terminal. Then the webpage will show up in the browser and changes will be updated (when saved in VS).__\n\nTo refer to specific parts of the document, just type the part, followed by curly brackets, e.g. \n\t`body { font-size: 3rem;`\n\t\t\t\t`background: green; `\n\t\t\t\t`\n\nYou can refer to `img` (e.g. specifying borders around images), `h1` (to change the style of all H1 headers), `a` (to change the style of all links), etc. \n\nIf there are several segments with the same style, you can group them together, e.g. \n`h2, h3 {....}`\n\n\n### Classes\n\nTo further specify a style for certain selected parts of the website, create a class in the stylesheet:\n`.someclass { (some css style)}`\nand then in the .html file, add the following tag to the part of the code you want to apply that style on, e.g. a certain paragraph only. \n`\u003cp class=\"someclass\"\u003e ...... \u003c/p\u003e`\n\nClasses can be used several times in a document. You can use more than one class per html tag. \n\n\n### Pseudo-classes and links\nPseudo classes often start with a colon.\n\n`a:link` --\u003e unvisited links of a webpage\n`a:visited`--\u003e style for visited links\n`a:focus` --\u003e the currently \"focused\" (selected) element\n`a:hover` --\u003e state of link when hovered over\nThese pseudo classes (if used) must go in the order listed!  L - V - F - H\n\nIt's very nice, for example, to change the background colour of the link or make the text go bold when hovered over. \n\nTo use **classes** for specific links (e.g. a class \"bigandbold\", in the stylsheet write:\n`a.bigandbold { .... }` `\nand in the .html file write add the class tag to the relevant `\u003ca href.... \u003e`:\n`\u003ca href=\".....\" class=\"bigandbold\"\u003e....`\n\n_NB: Here, it's just a **.** whereas in the pseudo classes referring to all links in general, it was a **:**_\n\nClasses and pseudoclasses can also be grouped together (with other segments) if they should have the same style, e.g.:\n\n`h2, h3, .bigandbold, a:link { .... }` \nNB: separated by **comma**!\nSo the style is applied to all of these elements!\n\n### Targeting things more specifically\nChain the \"location\" together with spaces in between. = descendant selector.\nE.g. all unvisited links located inside an unordered list:\n`ul a:link { .....}`\nNB: separated by **space**!\nSo the styling is only applied to the a:link of the unsorted list.\n\n### IDs\nSimliar to classes, but can be used only once per page.\nIDs start with #:\n`#smallanditalics { .... }` \n\nIDs are very specific, overriding styles from elements and classes. \nIDs are not very common in CSS nowadays, but very common in Javascript.\n\n\n### Using a different font than what is by default offered in css\n\nFind a font on Google Font, e.g. Crimson Text.\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text\n\nClick on the little + sign next to the example text, e.g. for Regular.\nIn the \"Use on the web\" box, select \"@import\", then copy the text in between the `\u003cstyle\u003e... \u003c/style\u003e` tags.\n\nPaste this text at the very top of your css stylesheet.\n\nThen, when selecting a font-family, select \"Crimson Text\". \n\n\n### The Box model\n![](projects/attachments/Screenshot%202022-07-30%20at%2016.07.54.png)\n\n#### \u003c div\u003e\nMakes a box. (div = division)\n\nIt's often very useful to draw borders around elements (divs, paragraphs, headings, etc.) to figure out if the distance between them is caused by padding or by margins.\n\n`p { border: 2px black solid; }`\n\n#### margin\nMargin values can be negative or positive. Negative margins makes divs overlap.\n`margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left`\n\n#### border\nBorder around the div.\n`border-width, border-style, border-color, border-top, border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc.`\n\n#### Example of how to use divs\n`\u003cdiv class = \"box1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome text, blalbabllablab \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`\n\nAnd then in the css style sheet, the style of the .box1 class can be specified, e.g.:\n\n`.box1 {width: 25%;`\n\t\t\t`border: 2px solid black;`\n\t\t\t`background-color: green;`\n\t`}`\n\n\n#### block vs. inline elements\nBlock elements stretch across whole screen. \nInline elements are only as wide as their content (e.g. images, links, strong text, emphasised text).\n\nIn inline elements, you can only add *padding* to either side, not on top and bottom! \n\n##### How to change an inline element to a block element\nWhen I have a link (in-line element) and I want it to be bigger, e.g. filling out a whole box that is clickable.\n\n`a {display: block;}`\n\n\n#### Navigation bars\nUser `\u003cnav\u003e` html tag and fill it with an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e`) of links. To access only the links in that nav bar in the css style sheet (to e.g. specify a hover state), use :\n`nav a:hover {....}` \n\n##### Example of creating a navigational bar with clickable buttons\n\n1. In .html, make an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca....\u003e`) inside a `\u003cnav\u003e` tag with the links that you want in the navigation bar.\n2. In .css, change the font, e.g. `body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}`\n3. To access the list of navigation bar elements, type inside of `nav ul {...}`. \n4. To remove the points in front of unordered list items: `list-style-type: None`\n5. Good idea to clean up (i.e. remove) unnecessary margins and padding from some elements: `nav ul {padding: 0; margin: 0;}`\n6. Reduce the width of the box containing the links, i.e. the `\u003cli\u003e` element: `nav li {width: 8rem;}`\n7. Give the box a background colour to make it more visible: `nav li {background-color: lightblue;}`\n8. Center the link text inside the box: `nav li {text-align: center;}`\n9. Remove underlines of links: `nav a {text-decoration: none;}`\n10. More space between the buttons: `nav li {margin-bottom: 0.5rem;}`\n11.

Rainbow Plantlife\nhttps://rainbowplantlife.com/best-easy-vegan-banana-bread/\n### Ingredients\n- 90 mL aquafaba\n- 3 medium-sized _very ripe_ bananas (around 300g)\n- 90 mL oat milk\n- 1 tablespoon lemon juice\n- 75g neutral-tasting oil\n- 115g organic brown sugar\n- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n- 240 to 250g all-purpose flour\n- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n### Instructions\n1. Preheat the oven to 176¬∞C. Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line a 9√ó5-inch (23√ó13 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper, letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling.\n2. Pour the aquafaba into a medium bowl. Using a handheld electric mixer, whip the aquafaba on medium speed for 45-60 seconds until uniformly foamy.\n3. Wipe out the bowl used for the aquafaba. Add the three bananas to the bowl and mash with a fork until smooth and no lumps remain (or, for a more rustic banana bread, leave a few chunks in). FYI: the 3 mashed bananas should weigh around 300g.\n4. Stir the lemon juice into the oat milk and set aside. This is the vegan \"buttermilk.\" \n5. In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and oil. Mix using the electric mixer or a whisk until well combined.\n6. Add the whipped aquafaba and mix until well incorporated. Add in the vegan \"buttermilk\" and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add the mashed bananas and mix until well incorporated.\n7. Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon to the wet ingredients. Switch to using a silicone spatula (if you don‚Äôt have one, use a large wooden spoon). Gently stir until the ingredients are just barely combined. It‚Äôs okay if you can see a few traces of flour.\n8. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top of the batter using a spatula or spoon.   \n9. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes. Since every home oven differs, I like to start checking at 45 minutes. The banana bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the center top **at a slight angle** comes out a few moist crumbs. If there's runny batter, it needs more time.\n10. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Then remove the bread from the pan and cool on the rack for at least 20 to 30 minutes before slicing (the bread is still cooking and setting up, so don't slice too early).\n11. To store, place completely cooled banana bread in an airtight container or wrap tightly in plastic and leave on the counter for 2-4 days (if using decorative banana topping, the topping a will start to brown after day 1). You can also freeze the banana bread. If you freeze the whole loaf, allow it to defrost on the countertop for 2-3 hours. If you freeze individual slices, defrost on the countertop for 20-30 minutes.\n\n### Verdict \n**7/10**\nVery nice and very cakey, almost too fluffy. The texture is like store-bought cake, very fine pores and bouncy. I'm missing a bit the \"roughness\" or breadiness of banana bread. Would be nice with some chunks or some whole grain in it. It does get quite sticky in the mouth, don't know if that's the bananas or the aqua faba, or something. \n\n\n\n\n## 2. BBC GoodFood (adapted)\nhttps://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/vegan-banana-bread\nAlso, incidentally, almost the exact same recipe as here: https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/vegan-banana-bread/\n\nOk, already made the \"mistake\" of adapting a recipe and not sticking 100% to the instructions. I'll write down the ingredients how I used them, and not the original recipe.\n\n### Ingredients\n- 3 bananas - I used frozen and thawed and poured away the excess liquid\n- 75 g vegetable oil - (actually the original recipe said 75 _mL_... I used half coconut fat and half linseed oil\n- 100 g brown sugar\n- 225 g flour in total - I used about 150 g normal flour, 50 g Graham flour and 25 g oat flakes for some bite\n- 3 tsp baking powder\n- 2 tsp cinnamon\n- 50 g dried fruits or nuts (optional) - I used 30 g dried cranberries and 20 g chopped walnuts\n\n### Instructions\n1. Preheat oven to 200¬∞C. Grease a loaf tin and powder with flour.\n2. Mash the banana with a fork and mix with the sugar and fat.\n3. Mix together the other dry ingredients.\n4. Mix dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir well until no dry lumps are left. The batter didn't flow, it had almost a (wet) cookie dough consistency. \n5. Fill batter into the tin and bake for 20 min, then cover with aluminium foil and bake another 20 min. \n\n![|500](Pasted%20image%2020240325192525.png)\n### Verdict\n**8/10**\nI gave it higher points than the previous recipe, because it had the heartiness that I like in a banana bread. Unfortunately it didn't rise much, which could be due to the flour mix that I used, a lack of liquid (since I poured away some banana liquid), or not enough raising power from the baking powder. \nThe denseness/moistness and the dried fruits and nuts make it taste like a mix between a banana bread and a fruit bread. \nNext time try this recipe with some (vegan) yogurt to both increase the moisture and also provide an acidic component to increase rising from the baking powder. Also, don't use coconut oil, use 100% liquid vegetable oil. \n\n\n\n## 3. BBC GoodFood (adapted again)\nSame base recipe as above, with the following changes\n- Only liquid vegetable oil (rapeseed). \n- 200 g normal flour + 25 g Graham flour\n- 30 g dried cranberries, 20 g chopped walnuts\n- 3 non-frozen bananas\n- 1 tsp baking powder + 3/4 tsp baking soda (because we ran out of baking powder, and baking soda is about 3x as strong, according to the internet)\n\n### Instructions\n1. Preheat oven to 200¬∞C. Grease a loaf tin and powder with flour.\n2. Mash the banana with a fork and mix with the sugar and fat.\n3. Mix together the other dry ingredients.\n4. Mix dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir well until no dry lumps are left. The batter didn't flow, it had almost a (wet) cookie dough consistency. \n5. Fill batter into the tin and bake for 20 min, then cover with aluminium foil and bake another 20 min. \n\n### Verdict\n**9.5/10**\nPretty much the perfect banana bread. What would I improve? Maybe slightly higher variation in dough texture? Try a teeny tiny bit of rolled oats in the next one. Slightly too sweet perhaps? \n\n## 4. BBC GoodFood (3rd variation)\nSame recipe as in trial 3, with the following changes:\n- 190 g normal flour (72 g normal wheat flour + 118 g wheat pattiserie flour, because I ran out of normal flour) + 25 g Graham flour + 10 g rolled oats\n- Cardamom instead of cinnamon (1/2 tsp finely ground and 1/2 roughly ground) - just to mix things up\n- 90 g brown sugar (Muscovado sugar, have used that in all the recipes)\n- 1/4 tsp salt\n- 30 g chopped dried lingonberries, 18 g chopped walnuts, 5 g roasted and lightly salted sunflower seeds (because I ran out of walnut)\n\nInstructions as above. Baking tin greased with vegan butter and dusted with breadcrumbs.\n\n### Verdict\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.709530322Z","tags":null},"/projects/cooking/Banana-bread-investigation-Silvias-MacBook-Pros-conflicted-copy-2024-04-09":{"title":"Banana bread investigation","content":"What is the best (vegan) banana bread recipe? \nLet's test different ones and rate them. \n\n## 1.

Mix gluten flour with water and knead to form a nice, chewing-gum like dough. Let rest for 10 min.\n2. Mix seasoned broth: 4 cups water, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp white pepper, 2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 stock cube, 2 tsp maggi seasoning, 2 tsp soy sauce. \n3. Stretching the protein: flatten and stretch the dough into a rectangle, then cut into three strips that are connected at the top. Braid into a tight braid, stretch the strands while doing it. At the end, tuck the ends in to close it off. Streatch out the braid gently into a rope. Then knot the rope tightly several times (to minimize puffing during simmering). As many knots as possible.\n4. Simmer the gluten dough: Place the tight knot into the simmering broth, simmer for 1h (flip over halfway through). After 1h, let it rest in the same liquid for a few hours, up to o/n in the fridge. \n5. Shred the seitan into chickeny strips with your hands. \n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/cooking/Thermomix-recipes":{"title":"Thermomix recipes","content":"\n\n## Walnuss-Risotto mit gebackenen Tomaten\n![|300](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230821075607.png)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Gebackene Tomaten\n\n- 100 g Zwiebeln, halbiert\n- 1 Knoblauchzehe\n- 1 TL brauner Zucker\n- 1 TL Salz\n- ¬Ω TL Pfeffer\n- 6 Zweige Thymian, abgezupft, und etwas mehr zum Garnieren\n- 50 g Oliven√∂l\n- 400 g Cherry-Tomaten, halbiert\n\n#### Walnuss-Risotto und Fertigstellung\n\n- 80 g Walnussh√§lften\n- 1 Zwiebel, halbiert\n- 40 g Oliven√∂l\n- 320 g Risottoreis, z.

Best mixed with other \"softer\" legumes, like Toor dal or soy bean. \n- Same with \"tough\" lentils (e.g. Gotland lentils): they don't make a good cake on their own, but are a good addition to other legumes that would give a too soft cake.\n- Fava beans give a starchy/meaty, but quite soft texture. Would benefit from mixing with something tougher (e.g. Gotland lentils).\n- Quinoa gives a very dense and chewy texture. Grows VERY quickly and overheats very easily! \n- Toor dal can get quite chewy and meat-like, especially when it's boiled and fried after fermentation. \n\n## Fermentation\n- Rather slightly too cold (29 ¬∫C) than too warm (\u003e35 ¬∫C). \n- It's good to test a new batch of starter culture first, to see how active it is. But generally using a bit less starter and incubating for longer at not too high temperature gives the best tempeh. Adding a lot of starter culture results in too rapid fermentation --\u003e too much heat development --\u003e overripe (ammonia) taste and black sporulation spots.\n- Adding salt to the bean cooking water improves the taste only a tiny bit. It's not really worth adding it, and it might slow down fungal growth. It's better to simmer in soy-water afterwards, or marinate. \n- Good sized bags are e.g. Zip bag 16x12cm, PE-LD (ordered from Fyndiq). Fill with about 200-250 g of cooked beans for nice-sized block. Not more, otherwise it gets too thick and develops too much internal heat during mycelium growth.\n\n\n## Cooking\n- When boiling in salt water, **boil for 4-5 min total**, otherwise it gets too soggy and the legumes get too cooked.\n\n## Storing\n- Do not store for more than 2 days in the fridge without prior heat treatment (see below)! It continues fermenting and will start to taste very funky.\n\n## What has worked best so far\n### Fermentation\nFor all legumes: \n- Add **4 Tbsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) apple cider vinegar after cooking, then let dry a bit, e.g. in a **50C** oven for **30-60 min** with occasional stirring. \n- Mix with **1-2tsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) tempeh starter. \n- Fill into plastic bags or glass dishes, nicely compact. For plastic bags, poke holes with a wooden skewer every few centimers. \n- Cover with a clean tea towel and place in the oven onto a heating mat, place the temperature sensor into one of the cakes and set the thermostat to 30C. Close the oven door and just leave it without turning on the oven. Observe the temperature and when it goes over 32C, turn off the heating pad (for a while). If it continues to go up, remove the tea towel, or even take the cakes out of the oven. It really shouldn't be much warmer than 32C for a long time, otherwise it tastes too fermented. Ideal is **30C**. \n- If it looks done after less than 24h or if it starts to get black sporulation spots, place it in the fridge for 1-2 days for slow continued growth. \n\nGenerally, after **30-40h** the cakes are sufficiently densly permeated with mycelium to hold together when cut and marinated. Much earlier than that, and it's a crumbly bean mess that tastes more like just cooked beans than tempeh. Much longer than that and it can get very squidgy and have a very fermented, funky taste (which some people like, but I don't). \n\nIdeal time plan:\n- Soak beans over night.\n- Cook beans in the afternoon, dry and let cool down. \n- Inoculate early evening, place on heating mat/in oven. During the first 12h there's little risk of overheating, so no observation necessary. \n- During the next day, occasionally check the thermometer or touch the cakes. If temperature gets too high, place them in a cooler place to \"calm down\" the fermentation. \n- In the evening of day 2, either place the cake in the fridge if it is nice and dense. If it still looks a bit loose, just leave it on the countertop over night and place it in the fridge the next day. \n- Proceed with heat treatment, cooking it right away, or placing it in the freezer. \n\n### Substrates\n#### Soy beans\n250 g, rinse and soak o/n. Try to remove as much skin as possible from the beans by pressing them through your hands. Doesn't need to be 100%, but good if about half of the beans  lose their skin. Cook for **50 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Nice on its own or mixed with other legumes. _Soy beans increase in weight about 2X during cooking._\n\n#### Black beans\n250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation (this definitely helps with growth!). Don't bother chopping in food processor or dehulling. Best to mix 1:1 or 3:2 with a legume with thinner skin, e.g. Toor dal. _Black beans increase in weight about 1.8X during cooking._\n\n#### Toor dal\n125 g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Best to mix 1:1 or 2:3 with a legume with thicker skin, e.g. black beans, since Toor dal on its own ferments SUPER fast and often over-ferments. \n\n#### Grey peas\nDid not work at all [Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Fava%20beans%20with%20salt,%20grey%20peas%20(2020-11-24)), they have a too tough skin. Need to be dehulled and/or split. \n\n#### Fava beans\nSoak o/n, cook for **2.5 min**. Nice, slightly chewy tempeh [Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Fava%20beans%20with%20salt,%20grey%20peas%20(2020-11-24))]. Need VERY little cooking. _Fava beans increase in weight about 1.7X during cooking._\n\n#### Adzuki beans\nSoak o/n, cook for **8 min** without dehulling. Lose most of the pretty red colour during cooking. Increase in weight about 1.8X during cooking. Does not work well on its own (doesn't stick together). Needs some softer legume mixed in (e.g. Toor dal, Fava bean, soy bean). \n\n\n\n### Post-fermentation\nWhen placed in the fridge, it continues to ferment and change in taste and texture. So for slightly under-fermented cakes that's a good think to do for 1-2 days. For well-fermented cakes however, I wouldn't store it in the fridge without heat-treating (and inactivating, i.e. killing) the fungus. \n\n#### Heat treatment\nRemove the tempeh cake from the plastic bag or glass dish and wrap in aluminium foil. Place in **85¬∞C oven for 30 min**, then let cool down on the counter top. After this, the tempeh is good in the fridge for about 1-2 weeks.\n\nAlso possible (if right plastic bags are chosen) to heat-treat in the bag. E.g. LD-PE has a melting point of \u003e105¬∞C. Wrap in aluminium foil (to prevent loss of moisture) and leave in **85¬∞C oven for 45-60 min**. The tempeh block shrinks a bit inside the plastic bag.\n\n#### Freezing\nVery conveniently, the finished cakes can just be thrown into the freezer for long-term storage and thawed whenever you want to eat it. Best is to place it in the fridge on the day before consumption and let it thaw slowly. It's also very convenient to add marinade to the frozen cake and let it marinate and thaw at the same time in the fridge over night. \n\n\n## Gifting tempeh\nA nice way to give tempeh blocks to other people is to wrap them into baking paper or sandwich paper as an outer layer (blocks still inside the plastic bag). \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106142018.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Bottle-gourd":{"title":"Bottle gourd","content":"\n![|400](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230722161611.png)\n\nMade: _2023-07-16_\n\nBottle gourd - also called calabash - is a squash with very squishy, white flesh.

The basic steps common to most varieties are: \n- acidification\n- coagulation\n- dehydration\n- salting\n- ripening\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230226134256.png)\n_(Common steps to most cheese making processies. From: https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/42344)_\n\nAcid production is the major function of the starter bacteria. Lactic acid is responsible for the fresh acidic flavor of unripened cheese and is important in coagulation of milk casein, which is accomplished by the combined action of rennet (an enzyme) and lactic acid produced by the microbes. During the ripening process the bacteria play other essential roles by producing volatile flavor compounds (e.g. diacetyl, aldehydes), by releasing proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes involved in cheese ripening, and by producing natural antibiotic substances that suppress growth of pathogens and other spoilage microorganisms. For Cheddar and Colby cheese production, starter cultures include strains of _Lactococcus lactis_ ssp. _cremoris_ and/or _lactis_. Likewise, blue cheeses¬† require _Lactococcus lactis_ ssp. cremoris or _lactis,_ but the mold _Penicillium roqueforti_ is also added as a secondary culture for flavor and blue appearance.\n\n## Overview of cheese production\n### Coagulation\nDuring coagulation, modifications on the milk protein complex occur under defined conditions of temperature and by action of a coagulant agent, which changes the physical aspect of milk from liquid to a jelly-like mass. Various coagulants are available, e.g. **lemon juice**, plant **rennet** or more commonly a proteolytic enzyme such as **chymosin** (rennin) or ‚Äì due to high demand from the cheese industry - **proteolytic enzymes** from the mould _Rhizomucor miehei_ obtained via biotechnology. These enzymes have an acidic nature, meaning they have optimum activity in a slightly acidic environment. Therefore, the action of LAB in this phase is crucial as they are required to rapidly release enough lactic acid, to lower the milk pH from 6.7 to near 6.2, (thus creating an appropriate environment for optimum activity of rennin) and later to pH 4.5 as the processing proceeds, creating an inhospitable environment for many unwanted bacteria, thus increasing the end product safety.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230226135604.png)\n_(Typical pH vs time profiles for several cheese varieties (time is in minutes unless otherwise noted). Adapted from: https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/42344)_\n\n\n#### Cutting the coagulum\nThe resulting coagulum may be cut with appropriate knives into curd particles of a defined size, e.g. 1‚Äì2 cm, or it may be transferred into containers or cheese moulds. The cutting or ladling of the coagulum is a very important step in the manufacture of some cheese varieties as it determines the rate of acid development and the body (firmness) and texture of the cheese.\n\n#### Heating or cooking the curds\nHeating (37‚Äì45 ¬∫C, depending on the type of cheese) the curds and whey affects the rate at which whey is expelled from the curd particles and the growth of the starter microorganisms. During heating, the curds and whey are often stirred to maintain the curd in the form of separate particles.\n\n### Whey removal\nAfter heating and stirring, and when the curd particles have firmed and the correct acid development have taken place, the whey is removed allowing the curd particles to mat together.\n\n### Salting and milling the curd\nIn cheeses such as Cheddar, when the curd has reached the desired texture, it is broken up into small pieces to enable it to be salted evenly. Milling the curd can be done either by hand or mechanically. Salting is usually done to enhance the taste of the curd and to increase its safety and shelf life.\n\n### Ripening\nFinally, for most cheeses, the resulting mass is molded and put to ripening for periods that may vary from 15 days to one, two or more years. Ripening is a slow phase, crucial for the development of aroma and flavor, brought about by the action of the many enzymes released by LAB. During ripening the protein in cheese is broken down from casein to low molecular weight peptides and amino acids. Proteolysis is the major ‚Äì and certainly the most complex of biochemical events that take place during ripening of most cheese varieties and LAB play an important role in it. This happens while the cheeses are stored in the curing cabinets and in some cases in caves, usually with temperature and humidity controlled\n\n## Flavour compounds in cheese\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230226135059.png)\n_(General pathways leading to intracellular meatabolites, and their degradation routes to potential flavour compounds.

Depending on type of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in addition CO2, acetic acid, diacetyl, acetaldehyate, ethanol and other substances can also be formed --\u003e gives the final product its distinct taste. \n- For production of fermented milk products, the best possible growth conditions must be created for the starter culture: \n\t- Heat treatment to destroy competing microorganisms\n\t- Hold milk at optimum temperature for the relevant starter cutlure. \n\t- Cool product quickly once best flavour has been achieved. \n- In today's industrial production, milk solid (milk solid no fat - MSNF) content is usually adjusted. \n\n### Yogurt\n- Depending on region, can be highly viscous liquid, soft gel, or drink. \n\t- Set-type: Incubated and cooled in package.\n\t- Stirred type: Incubated in tanks, cooled, packaged. \n\t- Drinking type: Similar to stirred type, but coagulum is broken down to liquid before packing.\n\t- Concentrated/strained: Incubated in tanks, concentrated (i.e. whey removed), packaged.\n- Volatile aromatic substances include acetic acid and acetaldehyde.\n- May have a fat content of 0-10%, most typical is 0.5-3.5%. \n\n#### Milk standardization\nDry matter (DM) content is standardized by:\n- Evaporation\n- Addition of skim milk or protein powder\n- Addition of milk concentration\n- Ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis\n\n#### De-aeration\nAir content should be as low as possible (LAB are facultative anaerobic). In addition de-aeration improves stability, removes off flavours and reduces risk of fouling during heat treatment. \n\n#### Homogenization\nGenerally done at 20-25 MPA and 65-70C. Improves viscosity of final product and prevents creaming. \n\n#### Heat treatment\nBefore inoculation, usually 90-95C for 5 min. Denatures about 70-80% of the whey proteins (mainly beta-lactoglobulin), which then interacts with the kappa-casein to form a stable body. \n\n#### Choice of culture\nDifferent mouth thickness, gel firmness, acidity, fermentation time, post acidification. \n\nIn industrial dairy yogurt production, fermentation time is 4-5 hours at 42-43C, and pH will reach 4.2-4.5 in the end.  Then cooling to below 20C to stop fermentation. \n\n\n\n## Recipes\n\n### Kishk\nhttps://www.196flavors.com/kishk/\n\nMakes 400g:\n\n-   1 cup coarse bulgur (khichin)\n-   2¬Ω cups thick yogurt (labn√©)\n-   2 teaspoons salt\n\n1. In a bowl, mix the yogurt and the bulgur.\n2. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the mixture sit in a cool place for 8 hours, by which time the bulgur should have absorbed most of the moisture from the yogurt.\n3. While adding the salt, knead the mixture then fold it and turn it several times with the hands.\n4. If the dough feels too dry and is able to absorb some more moisture, add more yogurt and knead again.\n5. Cover with a cloth and let ferment at room temperature for 10 days. (During these 10 days, mix the kishk daily).\n6. After 24 hours, fold and turn over the mixture several times.\n7. Continue to mix the mixture every day for 9 days to unify the surface and protect the kishk from mold growth.\n8. At the end of these 10 days, dry the kishk by spreading it out on a baking sheet, and place it in a sunny place, in a dehydrator, under a fan, or in a hot oven at 100 F (40¬∞C). As it dries, crumble it into small pieces.\n9. Once the kishk is completely dry, use a mortar and pestle or food processor to powder it.\n10.

Looks just pale yellow. Toor dal and Chana dal have increased in size quite a lot and have the consistency of raw potato.\n- Cook: Chana dal and Green mung dal: **5 min**; Toor dal: **10 min**. Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. `Could use less soaking or less cooking time.` Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.\n- Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix.

Yellow peas: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. Nice texture, grassy taste. Dehulling was a pain and there were weird peas that didn't get soft (~1%).\n\t2. Gotland lentils: **No soaking**. Cook for **12 min**. Nicely separated. Very good, fresh, chestnutty taste.\n\t3. Lentil Anicia: **No soaking**. Cook for **5 min**. Slightly tougher than Gotland linser, but also pleasant nutty taste.\n\t4. Fava beans: **Soak over night**, cook for **5 min**. Starchy, not a strong bean taste.\n\t5. Brown beans: **Soak over night**, dehull, boil for **18 min** `‚Äî\u003e much too long! Very mushy!` Starchy, clean taste. Dehulling was a pain, quite tough shell.\n\t6. White quinoa: **No soaking**. Rinse very thoroughly and cook for **9 min** in a lot of water. Fluffy and nice pop, slightly bitter, earthy taste, very voluminous.\n\t7. Toor dal: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219200730.png)\n\n- Inoculation: Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and heat up in dry pan to remove moisture. Spread on clean tea towel and let dry a bit. Mix in a tub thoroughly with 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) starter (_topcultures_). \n- Growth: \n\t- Open: Prepare 7 portions in plastic or glass jars for open incubation in sous vide immersion water bath, set to **32¬∞C** water temperature (=\"open\"). Incubation start, 19-09-2020, 21:00. Sous vide immersion cooker is very loud, but temperature in water bath was very even. Water bath shut off 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\t- Plastic: Prepare 7 bigger portions in perforated plastic bags for incubation above freezer (27¬∞C at the start) (=\"plastic\"). In the cupboard the temperature was varied, but once the mycelium started to take over it got VERY warm in some samples (35-43¬∞C!!). Bags put at room temperature 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\n### Results\n1. **Yellow peas**: Smell is quite mild, slightly mushroomy. Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans `‚Äî\u003e maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?` Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528094941.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095009.png]]\n\n2. **Gotland lentils**: Open: Very fluffy on the top and a tiny bit sporulation. Black colour is visible underneath, but that's from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling `‚Äî\u003e mix lentils with something else!` Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095038.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095058.png]]\n\n3. **Lentils Anicia**: Didn't develop mycelium at all, neither in bag nor in cup, and also not after \u003e 48h incubation. Discarded. `‚Äî\u003e Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?`\n\n4. **Fava beans**: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy `‚Äî\u003e dry the beans better next time and cook less!` Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets `‚Äî\u003e press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.` Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095210.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095234.png]]\n\n5. **Brown beans**: Plastic: Nice very white, dense block. Slight ammonia smell! Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095320.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095914.png]]\n\n6. **White quinoa**: Got the hottest and developed mycelium the fastest. The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It's sticky and slimy ‚Äî\u003e remove! `‚Äî\u003e Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.` The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top `‚Äî\u003e incubate for a shorter time!` Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag `‚Äî\u003e Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095423.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095440.png]]\n\n7. **Toor dal**: Plastic. Very nice dense cake with thick, smooth, white mycelium all around. Open: Fluffy top with slight sporulation, otherwise similar density to plastic. Both: Smells of almost nothing, very mild. Nice mycelium throughout, no wet or non-grown spots.

Mix with cooled, cooked beans.\n\n- Material: 220 g dry **favabeans**.\n- Soaking and cooking: **No soaking,** cook for **20 min** until al dente (377 g after cooking). \n- Inoculation: Steam out, add 1 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and after cooling 1/2 tsp _Topcultures_ starter (**2 tsp/kg**).\n\n- Material: 40 g dry **Gotland lentils**.\n- Soaking and cooking: **No soaking**, cook for **12 min** (72 g after cooking).\n\n- Material: 36 g dry **sunflower seeds**.\n- Soaking and cooking: **No soaking**, cook for **5 min** (49 g after cooking).\n\n- Material: 29 g (3 Tbsp) toasted **white sesame seeds**\n\n### Combinations\n1. 125 g cooked fava beans + 29 g toasted sesame seeds.\n2. 125 g cooked fava beans + 49 g cooked sunflower seeds\n3. 125 g cooked fava beans + 72 g cooked Gotland lentils\n\nMix well, fill into take away tubs, press a bit down (cakes are not very high, maybe 1-2 cm), but lid on loosely, incubate above the fridge. Not very warm up there, around 27¬∞C (18:00).\n\nNB: The sesame seed mix developed immediately a very strong sulfurous smell (poopy). That dissipated after a few hours of incubation.\n\n**24h**: Not very colonised yet, leave in cupboard. Condensation on underside of lid.\n\n**37h**: Tubs feel very warm on the underside, so take out of cupboard and leave on kitchen table at RT. Starting to get nicely colonised. Bumpy uneven surface because of big beans. Flip the cakes to get a more even surface and avoid too much fluffy mycelium on the top. The underside is a bit wet from condensation in the tub.\n\n**63h**. Harvest. The sesame mix has slightly started to sporulate in the corner. Nicely colonised, but not super dense mycelium. The beans and seeds are very dense. Sesame seeds are very much collected on the bottom of the tub. Smell is good for all of them, nothing unpleasant or alcoholic.\n\n1. Fava beans + Toasted sesame seeds: Slightly bitter. Sesame taste comes through a little bit, but not too strong.\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219201417.png)\n\n2. Fava beans + Sunflower seeds: Bit nutty.\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219201512.png)\n\n3. Fava beans + Gotland lentils: Embedded lentils are nice since they stay intact; the rest is nicely chewy. Nice texture. Winner! (Although when tempeh is being boiled, the lentils tend to fall out quite a lot)\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219201546.png)\n\n## Test starter cultures - LUVI vs. Topcultures (2020-10-07)\n\n250g **Toor dal**, soak o/n, then cook for **10 min**, drain. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), dry at 30¬∞C in oven for 30 min, then divide into 2 parts (500 g cooked beans in total). Add 1/4 tsp (**1 tsp/kg**) starter, mix and incubate in perforated bags in oven at 30¬∞C. 1) **Topcultures**, 2) **LUVI** starter.\n\n**16.5h**: Topcultures (34¬∞C) nothing visible yet, LUVI (32¬∞C) is already starting to get white and fluffy.\n\n**18.5h**: Topcultures (38¬∞C), LUVI (36¬∞C). Open door and leave on tray.\n\n**29.5h**: Topcultures: Not dense enough, leave in turned-off oven for another 12h (o/n). LUVI is sufficiently grown and smells nice (mild and slightly fruity) ‚Äî\u003e put in fridge.\n\n**40h**: Topcultures is now also colonised, but not as much as the LUVI sample. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203258.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203317.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203418.png)\n\n### Conclusions\nThe Topcultures starter must have lost quite a lot of activity while stored at RT, from now on store all starter in the fridge (or freezer if larger batch)!\n\nUnfortunately I stored the tempeh samples untreated in the fridge for 6 days and then they were DISGUSTING! `They cannot be stored untreated for that long!! 3 days is probably the absolute maximum, so either heat-treat or freeze samples after incubation!` I had to throw it away.\n\n\n## Heat-treated vs. untreated toor dal tempeh\n\n250g **Toor dal**, soak o/n, then boil for **7 min**. Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 30¬∞C. Add 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), mix. 1 bag: only Toor dal, 1 bag: a bit of ripped apart sockert√•ng dispersed in the dal. Incubate in oven at 30¬∞C.\n\n**21h**: Stop incubation, they are densely colonised. There is a tiny bit of sporulation starting around some of the holes. Both samples are colonies nicely, but the seaweed is kind of just sitting on top of the beans. There's no seaweed inside. On the surface, the seaweed feels a bit sticky/slimey.\n\nCut in half and freeze one half immediately. Heat-treat the other half by wrapping in aluminium foil and baking in a **85¬∞C oven for 30 min**. Then leave on the counter a bit to cool, put in a tub and store in the fridge.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203738.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203801.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203820.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203843.png)\n\nCook 8 days later:\n\nSplit into 4 pieces, let thaw (if frozen). No visual difference between frozen and heat-treated tempeh (other than that the not heat-treated one is slightly whiter). Slight difference in smell: frozen \u0026 thawed has fresh mushroomy smell, the heat-treated one smells mild and slightly stale.\n\nFor details of cooking experiment, see [Boiled vs. non-boiled - toor dal and black bean tempeh](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20cooking%20methods.md#Boiled%20vs.%20non-boiled%20-%20toor%20dal%20and%20black%20bean%20tempeh)\n\n## Black bean + fava bean mix\n\n250g **favabeans** and 125g **black beans**; soak separately o/n. Black beans: chop in food processor after soaking to about 1/3-1/4 of original size (though some remain whole!). Cook for **2 min**, drain. Favabeans: Cook for **2 min**, drain.\n\nMix both beans together, add 1.5 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix, spread on baking tray, let dry in 30¬∞C oven, stir ocassionally. Add 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**) and incubate in perforated bags in oven at 30¬∞C.\n\n**21h**: Turn off oven, leave for another 3h.\n\n**24h**: Harvest. Freeze one half immediately, heat-treat the other half immediately by wrapping in aluminium foil and baking at **85¬∞C for 30 min**, then cool down and store in fridge.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219204646.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219204701.png)\n\n**Conclusions**: Good tempeh! No off notes at all. Very little sporulation, very good and fast mycelium growth. However, because of the relatively short incubation time, it tastes quite \"fresh\" and beany/starchy. Not chewy at all. Could be due to shorter time, more or less cooked beans, heat treatment or lack of boiling in soy-water. \n\n\nCook 8 days later:\n\nFor details of cooking experiment, see [Boiled vs. non-boiled - toor dal and black bean tempeh](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20cooking%20methods.md#Boiled%20vs.%20non-boiled%20-%20toor%20dal%20and%20black%20bean%20tempeh)\n\n\n## Fava beans + Gotland lentils - different incubation times (2020-10-28)\n\n200g **favabeans**, soak in cold water for 5h, then cook for **2.5 min**.\n\n57g **Gotlandslinser**, no soaking, cook for **12 min**.\n\nDrain, mix, spread on baking tray. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let evaporate at 30¬∞C. Add 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), mix, incubate.\n\nHarvest at **24h**, **36h** and **48h**. Store in fridge (untreated) for 1 day. Then proceed with cooking.\n\nBoil each sample 2x2 min in 200 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce (= half strength of what I normally use). Dry on rack and store in fridge over night.\n\nFry and taste.\n\n**24h incubation samples**: Quite fragile, falls apart a bit. Not very bound. Quite starchy. Nice flavour. Bit crumbly. Maybe a crumbly topping? The lentils got nicely crunchy and are distinct inside the favabeans.\n\n**36h incubation samples**: Holds together better than 24h sample. Definitely a bit of a fermented taste. Looks very attractive with the embedded lentils. Could be more flavoured, the 1/2 concentrated soy-water mix is not as good as the normal one.\n\n**48h incubation samples**: Browns the best. Nice flavours, a bit more interesting. Bit dry and the fried lentils on the surface got quite (too?) crunchy.\n\n### Conclusions\nOverall, 24h sample falls apart too much and doesn't really taste of tempeh, just of lentils and beans. 36h and 48h are very close with 48h being slightly better. 36h tastes of several things, whereas 48h has a more rounded flavour profile. Both have kept a \"healthy\" tasting texture, i.e. more beans and lentils than meaty. Interesting since I'm sure earlier tempeh trials that resulted in very chewy-juicy tempeh were also incubated for 36-48h. Must be either the starter, the beans (e.g. soybeans) or the \"suboptimal\" incubation conditions in the fridge cupboard that cause the different texture. Both the 36h and 48h ones would be suitable for restaurants, whereas e.g. for a burger you'd want something chewier and juicier.\n\n`Run some more trials with different conditions and beans to see when I get a juicier texture vs. a beanier-healthier texture.`\n\n\n## Black eyed beans \u0026 black beans (2020-11-05)\n\nSoak for 24h: 125g black eyed beans, 125g black beans (from Fram).\n\n#### Black-eyed beans\nUse as they are, don't try to dehull. Change water and cook for **5 min**, then they are nicely done (almost too much maybe). Drain, add 0.5 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 40¬∞C. Mix in 1/4 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill in bag and incubate in oven at 30¬∞C (start: 21:00). Turn off oven at 22:00 (after 25h) and leave at RT until 12:00. Total incubation: **39h**. \n\nVery loose cake, falls apart when I try to lift it since the mycelium is not strong enough to hold the whole beans together. Would've been probably better to chop the beans a bit, and the skin is possibly also too tough for the fungus to penetrate properly. It also looks a bit unpleasant, since the black spots look like spore formation through the white mycelium.\n\n\n#### Black beans\nChop in food processor, 2-3 pulses. Rinse and boil for 2 min. (I could've probably treated the black beans like the black-eyed beans, i.e. not chopping or dehulling, and cooking for 5 min). Drain, add 0.5 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 40¬∞C. Mix in 1/4 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill in bag and incubate in oven at 30¬∞C (start: 21:00). Turn off oven at 22:00 (after 25h) and leave at RT until 12:00. Total incubation: **39h**. \n\nQuite loose cake, not as loose as the black eyed peas, but almost. Falls apart when boiling in soy water. The chopping helped to have the mycelium grow better, but it's still not strong enough to hold the mostly whole beans together. Looks good with the black skins though.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219210824.png)\n\n`The chopping doesn't really remove the hulls at all and just an irregular picture. However, the whole beans (black eyed beans) were not penetrated well by the mycelium and the cake was very loose. Therefore, chopping might be necessary for bigger beans with a tough skin.`\n\nFreeze half, heat-treat the other half (wrapped in aluminium foil, **85¬∞C for 30 min** in the oven). Boiling in 200 mL water + 60 mL light soy sauce for 2 min on each side. The two other bean cakes crumble completely (esp. the black eyed beans one). Store in fridge until use.\n\n`Retry black bean tempeh with more cooking, like in this recipe and also with longer incubation time (48h): `\n[https://fullofplants.com/black-bean-tempeh-soy-free/](https://fullofplants.com/black-bean-tempeh-soy-free/) \n\n\n**Cooking**:\n\nThe two black bean tempehs were too crumbly to fry in one piece, so they were crumbled into a pan with oil and fried. This basically resulted in beans flavoured with soy sauce being fried. There was not much tempeh taste or feeling. They were a bit starchy, but tasty, especially with some sauce. We ate it in tortillas.\n\n\n\n## Black beans + toor dal, 3 different starters (2020-11-12)\n\n_Test LUVI, Topcultures and Raprima starters._\n\n\n**Toor dal** 180g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. The beans are quite soft, probably overcooked ‚Äî\u003e mix with the black beans to balance that. Drain and let cool down, add a bit less than 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and mix.\n\n**Black beans** 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation.\n\nMix the two beans and make 3 portions:\n\n300g + 1/4 tsp **LUVI starter**, 300g + 1/2 tsp **Topcultures starter** (because I know it has lost activity), 240g + 1/4 tsp **Raprima starter** (just arrived, stored in freezer).\n\nIncubate in the oven at **32¬∞C**, start 17:00. Turn off oven from 21:00-9:00. 32¬∞C from 9:00-21:00, then off oven over night.\n\nLUVI grows fastest, very dense cake after 24h. Raprima only slightly less dense. Topcultures is lagging behind and not very dense yet after 24h.\n\nHarvest LUVI and Raprima at 9:00 (**40h**) and Topcultures at 20:00 (**51h**). LUVI and Topcultures: 285g, Raprima 230g.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219211955.png)\n\nStore in fridge until the next day, then heat treat at **85c for 30 min**.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219212022.png)\n\nSmell of LUVI and Raprima is mild and very slightly alcoholic or yeasty, whereas Topcultures is a bit off and musty. Topcultures also has a few patches of bad growth.\n\n\n**Cooking**:\n\nCut half of each cake into thick slices and boil in 400 mL water + 60 mL light soy sauce for 10 min. The other half, boil as a whole block. The slices soak up the liquid very well, but the block is not penetrated with liquid on the inside. `‚Äî\u003e When boiling, cut into slices!`\n\nFry the slices and taste.\n\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219212102.png)\n\n\nAll samples have a very similar consistency: chewy and juicy, but still with some beans inside, but not starchy! Yay! The toor dal has become more like a homogeneous mass that is nicely chewy and the black beans embedded in it give it a nice look and a nice change of texture, since they stayed a bit more beany.\n\n**LUVI tastes best, no off flavours, mild notes. Topcultures also tastes nice. However, Raprima has an unpleasant off-flavour!** `‚Äî\u003e Maybe it was over-fermented, or the 32¬∞C were too high?? Test again by keeping everything else exactly the same but with lower temperature and take different time samples.` It was quite long fermented (40-50h!), because I turned off the heating during the nights, which is not ideal.\n\n**Definitely keep the long cooking time for the black beans and don't bother chopping or dehulling**. However, mash a small part of it with a fork, that definitely helped for growth.\n\n\n## Compare different incubation times (28h \u0026 40h); black beans and Toor dal (2020-11-18)\n**Toor dal**: 90 g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. `The beans are quite soft, probably overcooked ‚Äî\u003e mix with the black beans to balance that.`\nDrain and let cool down, add a bit less than 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and mix.\n\n**Black beans**: 125g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down. Add 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation.\n\nMix toor dal and black beans together, add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter, fill in bag, incubate at 30¬∞C in the oven. Start: 17:00.\n\n**21h**: Turn off the oven and let incubate for another 7 hours. \n\n**28h**: Harvest 2/3 of the block and freeze immediately. \n\n**40h**: Harvest the rest and freeze immediately. \n\nBoth blocks look amazing with dense white mycelium and nicely embedded beans, smell mild and nice, no ammonia smell, uniform. The 40h block has a very thick white mycelium layer all around, no sporulation visible at all.\n\n\n## Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)\n**Favabeans**:  Different kind this time, they look rounder and less fragmented. Ville picked them up directly from Marcus (18 SEK/kg). Soak o/n, cook for **4 min**. Add **1/2 tsp** to the cooking water so that the salt is just about tastable. The cooked beans taste nice and the salt definitely improves the taste. Add 1/2 Tbsp (4 Tbsp/kg) apple cider vinegar and let dry in 30¬∞C oven\n\n**Grey peas**: From Ville. Soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Add 1/2 Tbsp (**4 Tbsp/kg**) apple cider vinegar and let dry in 30¬∞C oven. Squash a few peas with a fork to provide starting material for fungus.\n\nMix each bean portion with 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (**2 tsp/kg**), then incubate at 30¬∞C in the oven. Start: 13:00.\n\n**24h**: Favabean cake is nicely dense and has 35¬∞C, so take out of the oven and let incubate at RT for another 5h (=29h). Store in fridge for 2 days. Grey pea cake is still somewhat loose, so incubate for another 24h (=48h). Store in fridge for 1 day.\n\n### Conclusion\nFavabenas worked really well and they make a nice, slightly chewy tempeh. They salt improved the taste a little bit, but not really enough to make it worth losing a bit of viability. Grey peas didn't work at all, the tempeh is very loose, barely holds together and in between the peas it has actually started to sporulate. Throw away! `‚Äî\u003e Salt addition is not really worth it for the taste, better to boil or marinate afterwards. Grey peas don't work at all if they are not dehulled and split!`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Red quinoa burgers (2020-11-27)\n\n**Red quinoa**: Garant, 125g. Wash thoroughly. Boil in 2-3x as much water for **15 min**, then drain, add 0.5 Tbsp (**4 Tbsp/kg**) apple cider vinegar, spread on baking tray, let dry in oven. Add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill into small glass jars. Incubate in 30¬∞C oven.\n\n**24h**: Turn off the heat, then leave for another 22h (=**44h)**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113226.png)\n\n### Conclusion\nVery nice and dense cake. Need a lot of air, so good to incubate in open dish. Turn off heat quite early, it produces a lot of heat.\n\n\n\n## Toor dal + black bean, Fava bean + black bean (2020-12-01)\n\n**Toor dal**: 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Drain and let cool down, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg) and mix. Dry in oven at 30¬∞C. Add 1/2 tsp (2 tsp/kg) of Raprima starter, mix.\n\n**Black beans**: 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg) and mix. Dry in oven at 40¬∞C. Add 1/2 tsp (2 tsp/kg) of Raprima starter, mix.\n\n**Fava beans**: 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. `Much too long, should've been 3-4 min only! They are quite mushy and fragmented.` Drain and let cool down, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg) and mix. Dry in oven at 40¬∞C. Add 1/2 tsp (2 tsp/kg) of Raprima starter, mix.\n\nMix toor dal with half of black beans (cooked weight: 225g). Mix favabeans with half of black beans (cooked weight: 225g). Then fill in bags (new bags ordered from Fyndiq: Zip bag 16x12cm, PE-LD): **300g** are a good amount to completely fill the bag and get a nice thick cake. Total: 4x300g and a small bag with the rest of all beans mixed (150g) (i.e. 750g dry beans made 1350g wet beans/tempeh).\n\nIncubate in oven at 30¬∞C (start: 17:00).\n\n**21h**: Fava beans + black beans grew very fast (faster than the other mix) and also got hotter, so remove from oven and leave at RT for a few more hours (=24h in total). \n\n**28h**: Harvest fava beans + toor dal.\n\n### Heat treatment\nIn the bags (LD-PE has a melting point of \u003e105¬∞C), wrap them in aluminium foil and leave at 85¬∞C for 30 min, then they were still only 55¬∞C on the surface, so I left them for another approx. 1h (so **1.5h** in total). Then the cakes had shrunk a bit and become a bit soft, so maybe I overdid it. They kept in the fridge for more than 2 weeks though, without a negative effect on taste!\n\n\n### Conclusion\nVery nice dense cakes, but the thickness of the cakes made them VERY hot during incubation (\u003e45¬∞C!) and that's probably why they tasted a bit \"ripe\". Not inedible, but not ideal (in my opinion, Duncan doesn't care that much). `‚Äî\u003e Don't fill the bags quite as full, 250g is probably enough to get a nice thickness.`\n\nHeat-treated in the bag worked fine.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106115308.png)\n\n\n\n## Black bean, Adzuki bean, fava bean\n**Fava bean**s: From Ville (the rounder kind, dehulled). 250g, soak o/n. Cook for **2.5 min**. After cooking and drying: 430g (=1.7x). Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/2 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg). \n\n**Black beans**: From Kville Indian Shop. 125g, soak o/n, cook for 45 min without dehulling. After cooking and drying: 243 (=1.8x). Add 1/2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg).\n\n**Soy beans**: From Kville Indian shop. 250g, soak o/n, roughly dehull part of it, cook for **45 min**. After cooking and drying: 500 (=2x). Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/2 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg).\n\n**Adzuki beans**: From rawfoods.se. 125g, soak o/n, cook for **8 min** without dehulling. They lose a bit of the nice red colour, but are still pretty. After cooking and drying: 227 (=1.8x). Add 1/2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg).\n\nPut at 30¬∞C in oven, start temperature of all bags: 27¬∞C.\n\n**17h**: Turn oven off for a while, since all cakes are at 35¬∞C.\n\n**21h**: Take soybeans out (36¬∞C) to incubate a little longer on countertop. Leave the others (31-33¬∞C) in the oven and turn on the oven again to 30¬∞C.\n\n**26h**: Harvest and heat treat in plastic bags wrapped in aluminium foil, for 45 min at 85¬∞C. \n\n### Conclusion\nThis incubation was too rapid and the tempeh tasted a bit ripe. \n\n## Soy bean + oat residue tempeh (2022-01-27)\n**Soy beans**: 250 g. Soak o/n, cook for 45 min, then drain and dry off a bit. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**). Add 1/2 tsp Raprima starter (**2 tsp/kg**).\n\n**Oat residue**: Leftovers from oat milk production, about 30% moisture. Stored in freezer until use. Microwave for a few minutes to kill off microbes. \n\nSoy bean + oat residue tempeh: Mix inoculated soy beans 1:1 with oat residue. Incubate in warm oven. Periodically turn oven on and off and open door, depending on temperature of tempeh blocks (thermometer sensor inside one block). \n\n### Conclusion:\nNice dense cake without much sporulation (only around air holes). \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106143024.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106143050.png)\n\nAfter frying in oil: Texture is not bad. Dense and a little chewy. Also a bit fibrous but not too unpleasantly. Maybe a bitter hint (when unflavoured). Pretty good when flavoured with soy sauce.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106143208.png)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Dill-pickles":{"title":"Dill pickles","content":"\n![[projects/attachments/Screenshot 2022-06-10 at 20.05.47.png]]\n\nRecipe: [Vegetable recipes - Dill pickles](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Dill%20pickles)\n\n_2022-04-20:_\n\nNot as acidic and sweet as sm√∂rg√•sgurkar, but still nice flavour.

To stay crunchy, I added 2 bay leaves to the brine during fermentation, which seems to have worked well.\n\nAfter 4 months in the fridge, the cucumber started to get quite soft. Still delicious, but crunch is missing. So next time, **consume within 3 months**.\n\n_2022-07-25_:\n\nThis time I found the right cucumbers in the supermarket, the ones with the very textured surface.

It's a mix of two different apple trees, one of which is more for cooking/baking and the other one more for direct eating. I used about 8 small to medium-sized apples. \n\n\nTo test addition of lactobacillus starter cultures, I divided the cut veggies and fruits into four jars:\n1. no additional starter culture \n2. + Acidophilus starter culture\n3. + Vege092 starter culture\n4. + Vege011 starter culture\n\n\n_2022-10-31_: 24h, no cloudiness visible\n\n_2022-11-06 (7 days)_: \n1. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a little bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft. Not very acidic at all yet, leave a bit longer. Add a teaspoon full of liquid from a carrot ferment that's fermenting alongside to speed up fermentation a bit. \n2. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fresh jar, then transfer to fridge.**\n3. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft and a bit fizzy. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fresh jar, then transfer to fridge.**\n4. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft and a bit fizzy. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fresh jar, then transfer to fridge.**\n\n_Conclusion_: After  a few days in the fridge, the acidity has become better and the ferment is very good. Butternut squash pieces are firm and almost crunchy, while the apple pieces are very fizzy, slightly crunchy and very refreshing. The saltiness of the ferment is not very high or obvious when eating it, it's more the fruity acidity that's predominant. \n\nGreat addition to any \"boring\" lunchbox to add acidity and some fruitiness. \n\n**The best of the four are number 3 and 4.** The apples retained the most crunch, while still being nicely fermented. For the butternut squash, there is not really any difference between the four jars (and starter cultures). In general, the one with Acidophilus is probably my least favourite, because the apples became a bit mushy and everything tastes a bit more \"rotten\"-fermented than in the others (which are more fresh and acidic-fermented). That was also the sample where yeast grew most while standing in the fridge.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Squash%20and%20apple%2001.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Fermented-vegetable-production":{"title":"Fermented vegetable production","content":"\n![](projects/attachments/Fermentation%20station.jpg)\n\n[Fermented carrot and parsley root](projects/fermentation/fermented_carrot_parsley.md)\n\n[Hungarian celeriac kraut](projects/fermentation/Hungarian%20celeriac%20kraut.md)\n\n[Dill pickles](projects/fermentation/Dill%20pickles.md)\n\n[Fennel with mint and lemon](projects/fermentation/fennel_mint_lemon.md)\n\n[Turkish peppers](projects/fermentation/Turkish%20peppers.md)\n\n[UFO peaches](projects/fermentation/UFO_peaches.md)\n\n[Vietnamese carrot and daikon radish](projects/fermentation/vietnamese_carrot_daikon.md)\n\n[Fermented triple chili \u0026 peach sauce](projects/fermentation/Chili%20sauce.md)\n\n[Sauerkraut](projects/fermentation/Sauerkraut.md)\n\n[Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)\n\n[Chili sauce](projects/fermentation/Chili%20sauce.md)\n\n[Celeriac and carrot with caraway seeds](projects/fermentation/Celeriac%20and%20carrot%20with%20caraway%20seeds.md)\n\n[Brussel sprouts with garlic and pepper corns](projects/fermentation/Brussel%20sprouts%20with%20garlic%20and%20pepper%20corns.md)\n\n[Fermented apple with butternut squash](projects/fermentation/Fermented%20apple%20with%20butternut%20squash.md)\n\n[[Beet roots]]\n\n[Chayote - plain and Jamaican-style](projects/fermentation/Chayote%20-%20plain%20and%20Jamaican-style.md)\n\n[Green papaya Thai-style](projects/fermentation/Green%20papaya%20Thai-style.md)\n\n[Bottle gourd](projects/fermentation/Bottle%20gourd.md)\n\n[Water melon rinds](projects/fermentation/Water%20melon%20rinds.md)\n\n[Fennel](projects/fermentation/Fennel.md)","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Filamentous-strains-on-waste-streams":{"title":"Filamentous strains on waste streams","content":"\nA wide range of filamentous fungi are used for SCP production: Neurospora spp., Monascus spp., Fusarium venenatum. \n\nProduction of mycoprotein and yeast SCP from industrial waste streams: \n\n\n**Dates**: Safety assays and nutritional values of mycoprotein produced by Fusarium venenatum IR372C from date waste as substrate.

Dongchimi was stored at 4¬∫C during the whole fermentation. \n\n#### Microbial profile during fermentation\n- pH: Initial pH of 6.2 decreased quickly and reached 3.6 after 18 days of fermentation and stayed stable until the end.\n- Bacteria: During early fermentation phase (0-15 days), increase in bacteria abundance was inversly correlated with pH (i.e. more bacteria, lower pH). Starting value: 2.7 * 10^3 CFU/mL, peak value at 15 days of 6.2 * 10^6 CFU/mL. Then rapid decrease to about 1 * 10^4 at 40 days. \n- Yeast: _Saccharomyces_: Started at around 1.5 log. Increased when bacteria abundance decreased, reached maximum at day 40 at 5 * 10^5 CFU/mL. Then gradual decrease and not detected any more at 100 days. _Candida_ increased from 50 days onwards and reached peak at 90 days (4.5 * 10^4 CFU/mL). \n- Lactic acid bacteria: _Leuconostoc_, _Lactobacillus_, _Pseudomonas_, _Pantoea_ and _Weissella_ were present at day 0 (originating from raw materials). Bacterial community was rapidly dominated by genus _Leuconostoc_ within 3 days of fermentation. Bacterial diversity decreased rapidly during the early fermentation period. \n\t- Day 0: Diverse LAB such as _Leuconostoc citreum_ (most abundant), _Leuconostoc gasicomitatum_, _Leuconostoc lactis_, _Leuconostoc holzapfelii_ and _Weissella cibaria_. \n\t- Day 3: _Leuconostoc gasicomitatum_ became predominant, _Leuconostoc gelidum_ second most common species. Both present and dominant until end of fermentation. \n\t- Middle fermentation: _Lactobacillus sakei_ appeared in low quantities. \n- Metabolites: \n\t- Day 0-9: Concentrations of glucose and fructose low.\n\t- Day 6: Concentration of free sugars increased rapidly. Increase of lactate, mannitol, acetate. Mannitol, lactate and acetate stay pretty stable during fermentation (only acetate drops gradually towards later stages).\n\t- Day 30: Glucose and fructose drop rapidly again after day 30 and stay low.

In all samples, pH levels of 4.2 to 4.5 were maintained until the end of the fermentation period. \n\n### Kim et al., 2021\nEffect of temperature on microbial composition of kimchi.\n\n- Chinese cabbage soaked in 10% brine for 12h, then washed 3x. Mixed with other ingredients (radish, green onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger, sugar, myeolchi jeotgal). Packed into plastic containers, stored at RT (25C), 10C, fridge (40C) or in a standard kimchi refrigerator (-1C). \n- pH: Starting value 5.9. Increase in acidity and decrease in pH was slower at lower temperatures. Kimchi fermented at 4, 10 and 25C took about 30, 15 and 3 days, respectively, to reach pH 4.2. \n- Cell count: The number of viable cells increased during fermentation for 20 days in the 4 and 10C fermented kimchi (max. 8 log CUF/mL). At 25C, the viable cell count increased rapidly during the first day and reached 8 log, and then gradually decreased during fermentation. At -1C, viable cell count increased slowly from 6.51 log at day 0 to 6.86 log at the end of fermentation. \n- Microbes: A total of 3115 microorganisms were identified. 21 species were isolated belonging to Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Weissella and Candida. The microbial communities showed a similar pattern in kimchi fermented at -1 and 4C, and a similar pattern at 10 and 25C. \n\t- _Lactobacillus sakei_ and _Lactobacillus curvatus_ dominated all of the kimchi samples, regardless of fermentation temperature.\n\t- At 10 and 25C, _L. plantarum_ and _L. brevis_ appeared during the early to medium stages of the fermentation and dominated in the end, whereas these species were not found in the -1 and 4C fermentations.

When rice is below 40C, mix koji flour in.\n3. Cover dish with plastic wrap (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n4. Incubate at 30C. Check internal temperature every few hours, should be 27-35C.\n5. After 24h, sweet smell. Check temperature. Stir and break up lumps. Make furrows to dissipate heat.\n6. After around **40 h in total**, rice koji is ready.\n\n\n### Oat koji\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\nLike rice koji, but use 3 cups of oat groats instead. Soak groats for 6-8h, then steam until al dente. Follow the rice koji instructions.\n\nNice oatmeal cookie smell when done.\n\n\n### Barley koji\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\nMore prone to overheating! Nutty chestnut aroma when done. Will look less fuzzy than rice koji.\n\n- 1225 g pearled barley\n- 35 g wheat or rice flour\n- 2 g (2 tsp) koji starter\n\n1. Soak barley 6-8 h, drain and rinse. Steam for 1.5 hours or boil for 1h. Barley is done when the kernels are soft all the way through but not mushy. Drain and spread out on a drain to cool to below 40C.\n2. Toast the flour for 5 min, cool down. Add koji spores to cooled flour, mix well. \n3. Sprinkle koji flour on barley, mix very well.\n4. Put everything into a deep dish, cover with cling film (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n5. Incubate at 30C, check internal temperature every few hours (should be 27-35C).\n6. After 24-36h, surface growth and sweet, mushroomy smell. Monitor heat closely, stir and break up lumps, make furrows to dissipate heat. Adjust moisture if needed.\n7. After about **40 h total**, incubation is done.\n\n### Koji from LUVI\n(500g), Grind in mixer to powder. Add 200g water and mix to reconstitute = 700g fresh koji.\n\n\n## Shoyus and aminos\n### Soy-wheat shoyu\nFrom [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/):\n\nTraditional recipe: wheat berries/matvete (from soft wheat, not durum)= whole wheat kernel with bran, germ, endosperm but without the husk + soy beans.\nVariations: Use oats or barley instead of wheat, and lentils or chickpeas instead of soy beans.\n\n#### Ratio soy:wheat (legumes:grains): \n- Traditional **1 part dry soy, 1 part dry wheat** (by weight). \n- A bit more wheat: 1 part soaked soy, 1 part dry wheat. _The less wheat you use, the longer the sauce will have to ferment._\n\n#### Preparation:\n1. **Roast** the wheat berries in the oven until they are golden brown. Mill them in something like a coffee grinder on the coarsest setting or a food processor.\n2. **Soak** soy beans over night. (Soy beans will increase 2.3X when soaked, so calculate how much dry beans to use!)\n3. **Cook** soy beans for at least 40 min, until you can easily squeeze them between your fingers. Strain them and let steam a bit.\n4. **Mix** the steamy beans with the milled wheat (so the dry wheat soaks up the excess moisture). If it seems too wet, add more wheat. If it's too dry, spray some water onto it, or add more beans (if you have). Crush some of the soy beans with your hands.\n\n#### Inoculation:\n1. Dilute the spores, so they are easier to handle, with some flour.\n2. Check that **soybean/wheat mixture** has cooled down to below 40C. Spread spores over the mixture (e.g. with a tea strainer). Mix well.\n3. Line a pyrex dish with damp piece of cloth. Spread your mix into the dish. Cover with another moistened cloth. Put cling film over the dish, poke some holes in.\n4. Incubate (at **30C**) and keep a close eye on the temperature inside the koji, it can overheat very easily.\n5. After 24h, stir the mixture. Moisten the top cloth again if necessary. Put cling film back on and continue incubation. If koji overheats (\u003e37C) a lot, you have to stir a lot. Spread out in a thinner layer and turn off oven!\n6. After another 12h (**36h in total**) you should see a lot of growth. It shouldn't sporulate, but it's not the worst if it does a bit.\n\n#### Fermentation:\n1. Prepare a **15% brine**: 150 g of uniodised salt + 850 g of water. (You'll need about 1.65x the dry ingredients weight in brine weight).\n2. Clean your fermentation vessel well and pour in the koji.\n3. Pour the brine over the koji until the koji is covered. Let it soak for 1-2h. Pour some more brine until koji is covered again. Stir. You might have to add more brine over the next few days to keep the koji covered.\n4. Optional: Stir in a few tea spoons of unpasteurised miso to introduce beneficial bacteria.\n5. During the first **2-3 weeks, stir daily**. A lot of gas will be produced during that time that carry up solids to the surface. Push them down again so they don't get mouldy.\n6. Once your shoyu has settled down and is less active, reduce stirring to once every other day.\n\n#### Pressing:\nAfter **3-12 months**, put a cheese cloth into a sieve or colander, pour the fermentation mash in, cover with a cloth and put a weight on top. Let press over night. (Or use a cider press if you have one).\n\n#### Bottling:\n1. Clean bottles well, sterilise in oven (cover with aluminium foil, keep at 160C for at least 30 min, let cool down over night). Boil bottle caps in water.\n2. Heat the shoyu to 90C to kill off moulds and bacteria, but don't boil it! Pour the shoyu into the bottles and cap.\n\n\n### Bread aminos\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 680 g bread\n- 70 g all purpose or rice flour\n- 1 g (1 tsp) koji starter\n- 1.9 L water\n- 100 g for a 5% salt solution or 165 g for a 8% salt solution\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.\n2. Toast the flour in a pan over medium heat until slightly browned (5 min). Remove and let cool, then combine with koji spores.\n3. Mix koji-flour with bread cubes. Distribute very well.\n4. Transfer the inoculated bread to a casserole dish, cover with cling film and poke a few holes in.\n5. Set incubator to **30C** and place the pan in there. Check the internal temperature every few hours, it **should be 27-35C**.\n6. After 20-24h, you should notice a sweet smell. Stir the bread pieces, then continue to incubate for another 20-30h.\n7. When the koji is done, place everything into a glass jar. Boil the water with the salt and cool down to below 50C. Pour the brine onto the bread koji and mix thoroughly.\n8. Seal the jar with a lid and let sit at warm RT (27-29C) for 24h. Stir a few times during.\n9. Let mixture sit at regular RT for a week. Open the jar to release gases, stir at least once a day. After a week, the ferment should have settled down. When it's no longer active, seal the container and let it **age at RT for at least 6 months**.\n10. When you're ready to use the amino sauce, strain out the bread solids (or blend into a thicker sauce). Use the liquid for seasoning. Store in the fridge (because of low salt content).\n\n### Oat residue aminos\nAdapted from bread aminos (Shockey recipe) \nMade 2021-10-16 [Oat residue aminos](Oat residue aminos)\n\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 430 g dried oat residues (dried in oven at 50C for a day, from 1 kg fresh oat residue)\n- 44 g rice flour\n- 1 tsp **barley koji starter** (LUVI Ferments)\n- 1.2 L water\n- 63 g uniodised salt\n- 1 Tbsp seed miso\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Toast rice flour. Cool down to below 40C, then add about 1/5 of one bag of barley koji starter (whole bag is for 5 kg substrate).\n2. Disinfect a big bowl with Starsan and add the dried oat residues. _It feels rubbery, but not quite damp enough, so carefully add a little bit of water. Add 70 g of water and mix thoroughly with hands. Feels like a good dampness now._\n3. Mix in the flour koji starter with a tea strainer. Mix very thoroughly. _Oats feel quite dry again due to the flour, so add 100 g more water and mix._\n4. Pack into a Pyrex dish lined with a damp tea towel. Cover the oats with the tea towel, stick a thermometer in and cover with cling film + holes.\n5. Incubate at around **30C** until koji has grown nicely, but not sporulated (approx. **48h**).\n6. Place oat koji into a bowl, pour the (cooled down) brine onto it and mix throughly. Place in a large glass jar and leave at RT, stir occassionally for the next 2 weeks. _Mould forms on top over and over again, which looks exactly like koji mould ‚Äî\u003e remove regularly and try to weigh down the solids to keep everything submerged (it‚Äôs hard, since the oat residue is very fine)._\n7. After about 2 weeks at RT in the open glass jar, divide between small plastic tubs with screw-top lids, fill completely to the brim and seal. Now leave at RT for up to 12 months.\n8. Strain away the solids and filter the liquid. Store in fridge until use. Use as flavouring agent when cooking.\n\n### Shio koji\n(1-2 weeks), Shockey\n- 250g (125g) rice koji\n- 50g (25g) salt\n- 470-705mL (235-352mL) water\n\n## Misos\n### Barley + fava miso\n1.

Cupboard above fridge vs. waterbath with immersion heater.\n- Material: Soybeans from Indian shop, Herkulesgatan, Gothenburg: 25 SEK/kg **500 g dry soy beans**\n- Soak: Soak in water for 8h, dehull. Soak in water for another 8 h (**total soaking 16h**). \n- Cook in water for **50 min,** cool down, steam off. \n- Inoculation: Add 2 Tbsp (**4 Tbsp/kg**) apple cider vinegar, mix. Blow dry with hair dryer. Mix with 1 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) tempeh starter (*topcultures*). Spread in tray or in perforated plastic bag.\n- Growth: \n\t- Above fridge in perforated plastic bag. Start: 25-08-2020, 10:00. End: 26-08-2020, 17:00. **31 hours** **incubation**. Temperature was about **30¬∞C**. Opened door at ~9:00 since it was at 32¬∞C.\n\t- In non-stick tray floating in waterbath, heated with immersion sous-vide cooker. Start: 25-08-2020, 10:00. End: 26-08-2020, 17:00. **31 hours incubation**. Temperature was set to **31¬∞C**, then to 32¬∞C at 20:00. Turned off at 9:00.\n\n`Cupboard-incubated: Didn't grow as fast in the beginning as the waterbath-incubated one, but caught up in the end. Very homogeneous growth, very nice dense block. Passive warming, not as controlled. `\n\n![[projects/attachments/Soybean tempeh 01.png]]\n\n`Waterbath-incubated: Grew faster. Fluffy top, very nice dense block. Don't use nonstick pan, the tempeh took off the coating! Use stainless steel next time! Immersion sous vide was quite loud, esp. over night.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527131717.png]]\n\n\n\n## Soybeans - try to modulate texture (2020-11-05)\n\nSoak for 24h: 250g soy beans\n\n**Chop in food processor** until most beans have been chopped, 4-5 pulses (although that results in many very small pieces and some that are still intact beans). Rinse and boil for **20 min**. Drain, add 1 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 40¬∞C (takes foreeever to dry). Mix in 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill in bag and incubate in oven at 30¬∞C (start: 21:00). Take out of oven 20h later. Leave it outside on the countertop for another 5 hours. Total incubation: **22h**. Very nicely firm cake, very good mycelium growth, looks clean and very appealing.\n\n\nInteresting that the soybeans take so much longer to cook than e.g. black beans. They remain very dense and crunchy (like carrot) for a long time, whereas other bean varieties get starchy already after 5 min boiling, even the whole beans with hulls. The soybeans also don't seem to get soggy and there's no gradient visible between outside and inside of the bean or between small pieces and intact beans being cooked earlier or mushier. Also, no difference between small bean pieces and whole beans in terms of done-ness.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219211253.png)\n\nFreeze half, heat-treat the other half (wrapped in aluminium foil, **85¬∞C for 30 min** in the oven). Boiling in 200 mL water + 60 mL light soy sauce for 2 min on each side. The soy cake holds up perfectly. Store in fridge until use.\n\n\n**Cooking**: Very nice to slice and held up well, but the taste was slightly bitter and the texture was quite beany. I didn't find it very pleasant, Duncan said it was good. Could it be that the soybeans need to cook much longer (last time I cooked them for 50 min!)?\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Tempeh-cooking-methods":{"title":"Tempeh cooking methods","content":"\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113805.png)\n\n## Frying vs boiling vs grilling\n\n### Frying in pan\n\n**Green mung dal**: _(from [[projects/fermentation/Tempeh experiments.md#different beans]] - 2022-09-09)_ \n\nGreat texture, very chewy and juicy, very meatlike texture and no individual grains noticeable. Some bits have a neutral taste, some bits are very pungent and bitter (overripe?). Duncan liked the taste (or at least found it interesting) I didn't. \n\n\n**Toor dal**: _(from [[projects/fermentation/Tempeh experiments.md#different beans]] - 2022-09-09)_ \n\nMore juicy than chana dal, no clear bean structure visible on bite surface, very homogeneous. \n\n\n**Chana dal**: _(from [[projects/fermentation/Tempeh experiments.md#different beans]] - 2022-09-09)_ \n\nMore bean-style than squidgy. Visually very defined beans. \n\n\n**Soy tempeh**: _(frozen, from 26-08-2020)_: \n\nTexture between chana and toor dal. Cleanest taste, no bitterness.\n\n\n### Boil in soy-water\n\n200 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce. \n\nSubmerge pieces completely, boil for 5 min. Then after drying, fry in oil in a pan. \n\n**Toor dal**: Very nice texture, homogeneous, no clear bean structure or taste, good flavour. After boiling (before frying) it was much chewier than soybean tempeh, more meat like and soft, slightly bitter. **Chana dal**: Better than the \"fry only\" samples. No weird bitterness, but a bit starchy. After boiling (before frying) the texture is nice, but a bit starchy, but not unpleasant.\n\n\n### Grilled in oven\n\n**Chana dal**: Starchy and dry. **Toor dal**: Not as dry as chana, more juicy and a bit crunchy. **Soy**: Quite beany or vegetable taste, too dry!! `‚Äî\u003e grilling in oven without any marinade or oil is not a good idea!! Turns out starchy and dry`\n\n### Conclusions\n**Toor dal** was the best in all cooking styles. **Chana** was only ok in the boiled+fried samples. **Soy** was pleasant in the fried, but not pleasant in the grilled. **Green mung dal** was the juiciest, but too punget (for me). Duncan liked the unusual taste. \n\n`‚Äî\u003e Maybe soy + green mung bean blend could work well?`\n\nBoiling before frying was MUCH better than frying alone. It takes up juicyness and flavour from the boiling liquid. `‚Äî\u003e test different ways of boiling it (duration, additions, dashi, tamari, etc.)`\n\n## Boiling + frying of different legumes\n\nFor tempeh, see: _[Different Swedish legumes/grains (2020-09-19)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Different%20Swedish%20legumes/grains%20(2020-09-19))_\n\nPut every sample (seperately) for **10 min into boiling water** (flipping once in between). Then let dry on a rack. Then fry in oil. No salt or soy sauce added this time to keep the natural taste. `‚Äî\u003e 10 min is probably too much. All samples got very soaked up, and it also cooks the legumes very much.`\n\n1. **Gula √§rtor** (yellow peas): Crunchy sides are good, quite nice. Duncan found it unpleasantly starchy. They have more own taste (beany/peay, grassy) than other samples. Taste a bit more of something than e.g. the fava beans. Nice bite. Bit starchy.\n2. **Gotland linser** (Gotland lentils): Very distinct lentil taste, no chewy texture like in other samples. It's loosely packed lentils, almost no mycelium between. Starchy. `‚Äî\u003e Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. But it's a nice addition to a too smooth tempeh!`\n3. **Fava beans:** Very juicy/moist. Potato-cake quality. Pretty good, nice mix between something slightly starchy and meaty. `‚Äî\u003e Good candidate for mixing and further experiments!`\n4. **Brown beans**: I don't know what happened, but they had a really unpleasant, sour taste, even though no (unpleasant) smell at all. Kind of weird. No bite. Disappointing.\n5. **White quinoa**: Very juicy, but very dense. No seeds distinguishable, very homogeneous. Kind of beef-like, because it's a bit too chewy. `‚Äî\u003e Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. Also, reducing the cooking time might give it a bit more defined texture.`\n6. **Toor dal**: Very chewy, surprisingly homogenous. Kind of pork-vibe.\n\nWorst-to-best ranking:\n\n**Brown beans - Gotland linser - quinoa - gula √§rtor - toor dal - fava beans.** `‚Äî\u003e Definitely work on the fava beans more, try combinations with quinoa and linser to give it a bit more bite and a nicer look. Also try additions like seaweed, chili, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame), etc.`\n\n\n## Boiled vs. non-boiled - toor dal and black bean tempeh\n\n[Toor dal tempeh](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Heat-treated%20vs.%20untreated%20toor%20dal%20tempeh)\n[Black bean + fava bean mix](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Black%20bean%20+%20fava%20bean%20mix)\n\nOf each tempeh, I have one frozen (8 days) and one heat-treated and stored in fridge.\n\nNo visual difference between frozen and heat-treated tempeh (other than that the not heat-treated one is slightly whiter). Slight difference in smell: frozen \u0026 thawed has fresh mushroomy smell, the heat-treated one smells mild and slightly stale.\n\n### Cooking test\n1. Unboiled\n2. Cook for 2 min in 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, flight half-time\n3. Cook for 5 min in 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, flip half-time\n4. Cook for 10 min in 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, flip half-time\n\nCook all samples in oil for the same amount of time.\n\n### Conclusions\nSurprisingly, the heat-treated tempeh had a better texture than the frozen one! It was not dried out as maybe expected. \n\nIn general, the boiled samples were MUCH better than the unboiled samples, both in taste and texture. **5 min boiling was the sweet spot**, whereas 2 min was also ok if you don't want a strong soy sauce taste.\n\n#### Fava bean + black bean, heat-treated\n1. Unboiled: Better texture than frozen, bit moist, still a bit starchy but beans are a bit more separated.\n2. 2min boiled: Right amount of seasoning if you don't want it to taste of soy sauce. Beans are more separated and less starchy than in frozen variant.\n3. 5min boiled: Perfect texture, firm beans but still a bit starchy. Not as squidshy as some past trials.\n4. 10min boiled. Too much soy, but good texture. Maybe good starting point for a jerky?\n\n\n#### Fava bean + black bean, frozen\n1. Unboiled: Bland, very starchy, not enough flavour.\n2. 2min boiled: Much better already (compared to unboiled), bit dry and starchy, probably enough flavour.\n3. 5min boiled: Good smell, good taste, slightly less dry than 2min boiled. Nicely compact, really good flavour, a bit like a bean burger, still a bit starchy.\n4. 10min boiled. Took up a lot of soy sauce, so more flavour and salt than the others. Good flavour. Similar texture to 2min and 5min, but a bit more homogeneous.\n\n\n#### Toor dal, frozen\n1. Unboiled: Fresh grassy note, very different texture to fava bean + black bean, almost potato-y.\n2. 2min boiled: Tastes like a potato. Nice flavour. Needs something else in it, not only toor dal.\n3. 5min boiled: Same as 2min boiled, but slightly saltier.\n4. 10min boiled: Same as 2min and 5min, but more (soy sauce) flavour.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205716.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205737.png)\n\n![Black bean + fava bean tempeh fried in pan, unboiled, 2-5-10 min boiled](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205758.png)\n\n![Toor dal tempeh fried in pan, unboiled, 2-5-10 min boiled](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205816.png)\n\n\n## Red quinoa burgers (2020-11-27)\n\nFermentation: [Red quinoa burgers (2020-11-27)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Red%20quinoa%20burgers%20(2020-11-27))\n\nTwo different cooking methods:\n1. Simmer in soy-water: 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, 10 min simmering. Fry in oil.\n2. Marinate: 1 Tbsp HP sauce + some sugar + 1 glove of garlic, minces + some apple cider vinegar + some soy sauce. Marinate for 2 days in the fridge. Fry in oil.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe marinated burgers look VERY burger-like and brown super nicely. The boiled ones remain a bit white and \"raw\"-looking. Texture is good, a bit of chewiness and juicyness, but also a little bit porridge-like. The boiled ones have a slightly better, because slightly tougher, texture. The taste is very good, particularly of the marinated ones, quite meaty actually because they also soaked up a lot of flavour and also a lot of fat during frying.\n\n`‚Äî\u003e Definitely something that could be served to other people.`\n\nSee also [Mycobrewery instagram 2020-11-30](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIOspOnlpt1/)\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113610.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113631.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Toor dal + black bean tempeh: gulasch and Wellington (2020-12-01)\n\n### Gulasch\nI fried the tempeh bits with onions and then added paprika powder, stock, etc. Cooked it for almost 1h, but the tempeh held up quite nicely.

Leave for another day and taste again.\n- 7 days: Banana and slightly funky smell (like when I fermented the oat residues). Some kahm yeast growth on top of liquid. Fruit pieces have got a soft exterior and a crunchy core, and a clearly fermented taste. Should've maybe harvested 1-2 days ago when the fruits were still crunchy through and through? **Harvest today!**\n\n_Conclusion:_ Much more fermented tasting on the bottom than on the top of the jar --\u003e maybe stir next time.

Peel and cut onion into rough cubes. Peel garlic cloves. \n\nArrange vegetables in jar and fill up with brine until everything is covered. Top off with 1 vine leaf and weigh down so everything's submerged. Leave at room temperature for a 7-14 days. When it has a nice pickel-y taste and the liquid is cloudy, it's ready. Blend in blender to get sauce with the desired consistency. A bit of vinegar adds a nice flavour. If it's too thick, you can add a bit of water. Adjust salt to taste. Optional: mix with fruit purr√© or fermented fruit to get a fruitier and slightly sweet condiment.\n\nFill into clean bottles and keep in fridge for 2-12 months.\n\n\n## Kimchi (vegan)\nRecipe adapted from: https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-vegan-kimchi-recipe\n\n_Made: 2022:_ [Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)\n\n- 1 large Chinese cabbage\n- 1 small daikon radish\n- 8 spring onions\n- flaky sea salt (kosher salt)\n- 8 garlic cloves\n- 4 cm piece of ginger\n- 1/2 cup gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)\n- 2 Tbsp miso paste (white or red)\n- 1 Tbsp sugar\n\n1. Wash cabbage, then remove trunk and cut the leaves into rough pieces (approx. 3x3 cm).\n2. Wash the daikon and cut into little sticks. \n3. Wash the spring onions, chop roughly and set aside. \n4. Place cabbage leaves, daikon and green parts of the spring onions into a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp flaky sea salt. Toss to combine and work in a bit with your hands. Cover with a plate or tea towel, then let sit at room temperature until cabbage is wilted (min. 1h, better up to 12h). The cabbage will release some liquid. \n5. Combine white parts of spring onion, minced garlic, finely chopped ginger, chili flakes, miso paste and sugar in a blender or food processor. Start pulsing to combine everything. Slowly add water to get to the right pasty consistency for it to blend properly (approx. 1 cup). Blend this past about 30 sec, scraping down the sides to not have too big chunks. \n6. Add the chili paste to the wilted cabbage and mix well with a spoon. \n7. Prepare glass jars by pouring boiling water into them and leaving to soak for a bit. Empty the jars and let cool down. \n8. Fill the cabbage-chili mixture into the jars, pressing down firmly with a spoon or chop stick to pack it tightly and not leave any air pockets. Make sure the top is covered with some of the liquid. \n9. Close jars and leave at room temperature for 24h. Then transfer to fridge and allow to ferment for at least 3 weeks before eating.  \n\nIt will not develop much CO2, so it's actually ok to close the jar tightly. I still air it from time to time during the first days and weeks, when I think about it. \n\nIt will last forever in the fridge and just get more sour and softer. \n\n\n## Quick pickles (with vinegar)\n\n_Technically not fermented, but still delicious!_\n\n### Quick-pickled carrots \u0026 cucumbers\nAdapted from: https://livelytable.com/asian-style-quick-pickled-carrots/\n\n- 2 carrots, cut into matchsticks \n- 1/2 cucumber or several baby cucumbers, cut into matchsticks\n- ¬º cup rice vinegar\n- ¬Ω cup hot water\n- ¬Ω tsp sugar\n- 1 tsp salt\n- optional: fresh ginger slices\n\n1.

For dairy, both are firm, but for soy the 092 is still liquid after 8h. The acidity is quite low in all of them, although dairy 053 is quite pleasant. Soy 053 is very mild and vanilla-y. \n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\nContinue fermentation over night in the turned-off rice cooker: **10h, 40¬∞C-RT** (=18h in total).\nAll yogurts are firm now, to differing degrees. Stir before tasting.\n- Dairy 053: Quite runny. Nice mellow acidity without sticking out too much. No off-flavours. **Duncan's favourite** (\"Tastes the most like yogurt.\").\n- Dairy 092: Also runny, but not as much as 053. In addition, there's a thick, slimy component to the texture that gives it nice body. Acidity is very mild (milder than 053), no off-flavours sticking out. **Silfa's favourite**. \n- Soy 053: Quite runny, similar to dairy 053, though a bit more watery (might be also due to the lower fat). Too sour, very strong single acidity that reminds of red currant and tingles on the tongue. Fruity notes, vanilla. \n- Soy 092: Quite runny, very similar to soy 053. Missing the body of dairy 092. Strong vanilla note and quite strong acidity. Some undefinable off-notes. Duncan thinks it's pretty bad tasting.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a few days in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 053: Soft and good body, a bit watery. Just plops off a spoon. Quite acidic and quite clean acidity. No off notes.\n- Dairy 092: Thick and gloopy, almost a bit stretchy. Drips off a spoon in a slightly viscous way. Very good almost buttery taste and fine acidity (not overwhelming). Still Silfa's favourite. \n- Soy 053: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Quite runny texture. Very sour and quite a one-note, clean acidity, bit fizzy on the tongue. Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Not much body (neither in texture nor in taste). A bit too sour for me to eat/enjoy. Duncan thinks it has similar sourness to fil, but needs more body/thickness.\n- Soy 092: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Quite runny texture, but also a tiny bit viscous. Sour, but also a mild/buttery note. Has more body in flavour than 092, better. Duncan likes this better, mostly because of the vanilla note.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Find higher fat soy milk? \n- Test same cultures with oat milk\n- Test different cultures and compare\n- Some time in between would probably be good, e.g. 10h at 40¬∞C.\n\n### Vege011 and √ñresunds fil starter cultures\n_2022-06-16_\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 01**, **√ñresunds fil (Sk√•nemejerier)**\n\nSubstrates: Fresh dairy milk (3% fat), Alpro soy milk (1.8% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milks to approx. 90¬∞C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: \n- Freeze-dried culture: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (approx. 1/8 tsp) into 25 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 5 mL of that to inoculate each jar (of about 200 mL).\n- Store-bought fil: Take 1/2 Tbsp of fil and stir into each jar (of about 200 mL) = **1/4 Tbsp/100 mL**. \n\n**1st fermentation**: **8h, 40¬∞C** (in the rice cooker)\n\nAfter 3h, the fil-inoculated soy and dairy milks already firmed up and started to get sour, while the Vege011 milks were still liquid and sweet. \n\nAfter 6h, the fil-inoculated firmed up even more, Vege011 were getting a little bit thicker.\n\nAfter 8h: fil-inoculated firmed up a lot in both soy and dairy. Vege011 have soft yogurt consistency.\n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\n- Dairy 011: Quite loose structure. Not very sour but nice taste.\n- Soy 011: Quite loose structure, looser than dairy 011. Not sour, quite sweet actually and very vanilla-y.\n- Dairy fil: Good stable gel-structure and very nice sourness. But not so nice to taste warm.\n- Soy fil: Firmness in between Dairy fil and Dairy 011. Not as sour as dairy fil but pleasant. Very vanilla-y.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a day in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 011: Smells very animaly/milky. Has firmed up a lot and holds shape on spoon. Mellow acidity, bit funky. Very pleasant. Slight cheesiness maybe. Great texture, almost like stirred yogurt from the start. Much denser than the soy yogurts. When stirred it becomes very homogenous and smooth, with a bit of a gloopy, viscous texture that slowly drips off a spoon. Duncan: texture is better, but taste is not much better than the soy gurts. \n- Soy 011: Smells like vanilla yogurt. Wobbly-gelly. Very loose, runny structure. Taste is very nice. Not really sour, but the sweetness of the soy milk has disappeared and it's quite neutral with a nice vanilla note. When stirred, it's very runny and looks almost like custard. Curdles a bit. Very refreshing taste. Duncan found it watery, but after adding a bit of salt it tasted much better.\n- Dairy fil: Smells a bit lemony. Great taste, very pleasant. Rich taste, mellow acidity, no off flavours. Texture is quite firm, stays on spoon. But when stirred it becomes nicely soft and smooth, even a bit thinner than dairy 011 and a bit less viscous. Duncan: could still have more acidity, but nice taste.\n- Soy fil: Smells less like vanilla and more a bit animaly/milky. A bit more sour than soy 011, but also not very strong. Very nice acidity level actually. Vanilla aroma is not overwhelming, but present. Texture is like a loose gel. When stirred, it gets almost gloopy. More homogeneous texture than soy 011, very smooth. Clean taste. Duncan thinks it should be more acidic.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Dairy 011 and dairy fil are quite similar in taste, texture and acidity level. Dairy 011 is a bit more mouth-filling and viscous, maybe some bacteria that make exopolysaccharides?\n- Soy011 is too loose and thin. Try fermenting longer? \n- Soy fil worked really well, but could also benefit from a bit longer fermentation.\n- The vanilla taste in the soy milk is a bit much, try to find another plant milk to test.\n- Salt improves taste of soy yogurts. \n\n## Oat\n_2022-05-06\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 053**, **Vege 092**\n\nSubstrates: Oatly chilled mellan (1.5% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milk to approx. 90¬∞C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (fraction of 1/4 tsp) into 10 mL of water, shake.

Daikon pieces are nicely crunchy, slightly salty and have the tiniest hint of fermentation. \n- 5 days: Liquid still cloudy, sulfuric smells not as strong any more (or have I got used to it?). Bubbles coming up, but not fizzy yet. Daikon is very crunchy and has a slightly sourness/bitterness to it. Carrot is also crunchy with slightly sourness/bitterness, as well as still a bit of sweetness. Leave for another couple of days.\n- 7 days: Nice and crunchy, sour but could be more. Bitter note has faded a bit. **Harvest!**\n\n_Conclusion_: Both the carrot and the daikon are very crunchy, slightly sour, and still a bit bitter (unpleasant). Also, it smelled really bad (sulfurous) throughout the fermentation, sometimes worse sometimes less bad. Was considering leaving some out a bit longer to see how the fermentation progresses, but I'm a bit sick of the smell. Will probably ferment a bit further in the fridge anyway.  \n\nAfter 1-2 weeks in the fridge, the liquid has got clear (though it's still fizzing and bubbling a bit) and the bitterness has mellowed out. The acidity has increased slightly as well and is very pleasant now. Especially the carrots taste good, but the daikon is a bit too rotten/sulfuric tasting for my preference. **Maybe some sweet note missing to balance that out or cover it a bit?**\n\n_Try next time without the lemon (might have added bitterness?) and maybe a bit sugar in the brine afterwards when stored in the fridge._\n\n![](projects/attachments/Carrot%20daikon.jpeg)\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/plants/01-plants_main":{"title":"","content":"\nV√§xtzoner i Sverige\nhttps://nordensgard.se/zonkartan/\nhttps://svensktradgard.se/tradgardsrad/zonkartan/\n\n![|300](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240218110934.png)\n## Sources\n[Gardening books \u0026 websites](projects/plants/Gardening%20books%20\u0026%20websites.md)\n\n[Garden centres and shops](projects/plants/Garden%20centres%20and%20shops.md)\n\n## Balcony gardening\n[Plans 2024](projects/plants/Plans%202024.md)\n\n[General balcony gardening tips](projects/plants/General%20balcony%20gardening%20tips.md)\n\n[Inspiration pictures](projects/plants/Inspiration%20pictures.md)\n\n## Indoor plants\n[How to care for the plants I have at home](projects/plants/How%20to%20care%20for%20the%20plants%20I%20have%20at%20home.md)\n\n[Plants to get](projects/plants/Plants%20to%20get.md)","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/plants/Cornflower":{"title":"Cornflower","content":"## Bl√•klint (cornflower) (Weibulls)\n_Centaurea cyanus_\nAnnual\n- Sow outside: **April, May**.

Mist the leaves or put pebbles in water nearby.\n\t- Soil that drains well and retains moisture (mix something moisture retaining - like coconut coir - and something draining - like perlite). Also good: 2:1 soil-based compost and perlite.\n- Avoid:\n\t- Drafts\n\t- Direct sun\n\t- Water with high mineral content\n\t- Never let the soil dry out more than an inch on the top!\n\t- Temperatures below 18C.\n\t- Overfertilizing\n- Common problems:\n\t- Burnt tips and edges: Mineral burning, i.e. too much minerals in the water. Use filtered, distilled or rain water. \n\t- Leaves drying up or drooping: Too low humidity.\n\t- Burnt leaves, brown patches: Too much light.\n\t- Leaves that curl inwards: Underwatering\n\t- Yellowing or wilting leaves: Overwatering\n\t- Faded leaves: Too much light.\n- Occasional lukewarm shower is good to remove dust from the leaves. Best with distilled water, as mineral-rich water can leave white chalky deposits on the leaves. \n- Very good for bathrooms (high humidity), but they do need some light.\n- Give the plant a good trim to remove dried leaves. \n- Doesn't need much fertilizer. Half-strength during growing season. \n- Propagate by repotting: Gently separate the plants, disentangle the roots, repot into new pots.\n\n\n### Crassula ovata (Jade plant)\n\n![|300](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230426090944.png)\n\n- https://www.almanac.com/plant/jade-plants\n- Needs:\n\t- **Full sun**\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.713530359Z","tags":null},"/projects/plants/Inspiration-pictures":{"title":"Inspiration pictures","content":"![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240212193754.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240212193853.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240212194048.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240212194136.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240212194240.png)\n\n**Balconies from Malm√∂ Garden show 2024**\n![](Pasted%20image%2020240526150354.png)Double-level pallgkrage with snack peppers, herbs, strawberries and flowers.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020240526150445.png)\nQuarter-circle flower pot for corners.

Water and repot. They don't mind being crowded. \n- Don't like too much water: a soaking every week in summer when the top soil feels dry is enough. \n- Can be kept outside in the winter in a sheltered spot. Only water once every few weeks, and after winter cut everything back to 5 cm above the soil to encourage new growth. \n- Very easy to buy cheaply in garden centre, so maybe better than growing from seeds.\n\n\n### Osteospermum (daisy)\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240225154125.png)\n- Loves sun and can tolerate wind very well - can be hung over the balcony. \n- Dozens of varieties available. \n- Will spread out in the space that you give them, so they are a good choice to fill up empty corners in planters. \n- Like sandy soil, but will grow basically in anything. \n- Will wilt and look sad if it needs water. But generally doesn't need large amounts of water.\n- Dead-heading (i.e. cutting off tired looking flowers) will encourage new blooms. Do that regularly. \n- They really benefit from a good trim halfway through the season (e.g. beginning of summer). Of all stems, cut off the top third. You'll get a neater, bushier plant that will flower well into the autumn. \n- Can be kept outside in the winter in a sheltered spot. Only water once every few weeks, and after winter cut everything back to 5 cm above the soil to encourage new growth. \n- Take cuttings to have inside during the winter to be ready to plant outside next spring. Cut off fresh 10 cm stems from the plant, remove all leaves, put into a small pot with damp soil and keep in a warm spot out of direct sunlight. When roots appear, put into a proper pot in a bright spot. \n\n#### Varieties\n\n\n### Pansies\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240225155842.png)\n- Can be grown all year round, flower in any season, tolerate windy, wet and cold weather. \n- Exist in every colour of the rainbow and are easy to grow from seeds. \n- Like good drainage and moist soil, happy in sun or shade (but more likely to flower in sun). Warm temperatures and dry soil will cause them to suffer and get leggy. \n- During flowering season, dead-head tired flowers once a week to keep the plant happy. \n- Can be sown directly into soil, outside or inside. Inside in the warmth they will germinate sooner (within 1 week). When they have 8-10 leaves, plant them into a pot outside. \n- Are happy in a container and will fill the space they're given. Plant about 15 cm apart from each other. \n- After several months of growing season, they will die down and put seeds into the ground. So you can just leave them grow for the next season. \n- Very easy to buy them cheaply as plants in garden centre, so maybe better buy as plant than grow from seed. \n\n### Mohn/poppy/vallmo\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240225161945.png)\n- Direkt im M√§rz/April auss√§en und auf einen Abstand von 20-30 cm ausd√ºnnen.

Bl√ºtezeit Mai-Oktober. Je nach Sorte aufrecht oder kriechend, h√§ngend oder kompakt. St√§ngel sind auffallend vierkantig. Verstr√∂men einen leicht w√ºrzigen Duft und locken damit viele Schmetterlinge an. \n- Nicht besonders anspruchsvoll. Sonnig und warm, vertragen gut sommerliche Hitze. Auch Wind und Regen machen ihnen generell nichts aus. Substrat soll etwas feucht und gut durchl√§ssig sein. Gute Blumenerde und Ausrichtung nach S√ºden sind optimal. \n- Oft gie√üen. Erde im Gef√§√ü darf weder austrocknen noch staunass werden. \n- Extrem frostempfindlich. \n- Neuer Bl√ºtenwuchs wird durch entfernen der verwelkten Bl√ºtenb√§lle stimuliert. Regelm√§√üiges (w√∂chentliches) D√ºngen mit Bl√ºhpflanzend√ºnger f√∂rder die Entwicklung neuer Bl√ºtenknospen. \n- Im Sp√§tsommer/Herbst Stecklinge (ca. 10 cm lange Triebspitzen) schneiden und drinnen in Anzuchterde an einem hellen, k√ºhlen Platz √ºberwintern. Wenn sich Wurzeln gebildet haben, in einen Topf setzen. Wenn sie im Mai gro√ü und kr√§ftig genug sind, auspflanzen. \n- Varianten mit kr√§ftigen und h√§ngenden Trieben (z.B. f√ºr Ampeln): Samira, Empress, Lanai, Tapien. \n\n#### Varieties\n- Stor h√§ngverbena \"Imagination\".

Bl√ºtezeit Juni-September. 50-80 cm Wuchsh√∂he. \n- Dekorative Bl√ºtenbl√§tter schmecken zart und versch√∂nern Salate und S√º√üspeisen. Insektenmagnet.\n- Ab M√§rz vorziehen, direkt ins Beet ab Mitte April. Danach ist durchgehend bis September die Aussaat m√∂glich. Wenn September, dann bl√ºhen sie im n√§chsten Jahr. Keimdauer 10-15 Tage. Keimen am Licht, daher nur hauchd√ºnn mit Erde bedecken und leicht feucht halten. Wenn die Pflanze 4 Bl√§ttchen hat in T√∂pfe setzen und am Fensterbrett bei nicht zu viel Sonne wachsen lassen. \n- Auspflanzen ab Mai an einem sonnigen Ort. Magerer Boden (nicht ged√ºngt!), keine n√§hrstoffreiche Blumenerde, Wasser muss gut abflie√üen. Wenn man die Aussaattermine staffelt, verl√§ngert man die Bl√ºtezeit. \n- Sparsam gie√üen, Kornblumen sind Trockenheit gewohnt. Vertr√§gt keine dauern√§sse.\n- Verbl√ºhte Teile gleich entfernen. \n- Trockene Bl√ºtenk√∂pfchen kann man ernten und Samen f√ºrs n√§chste Fr√ºhjahr aufheben. \n\n#### Varieties\n- Bl√•klint \"Polka Dot\".

Sollen als Solit√§rpflanzen gepflanzt werden (eine pro Topf). \n- **Extrem durstig** - je gr√∂√üer desto mehr Wasserbedarf. Getrocknete Bl√§tter erholen sich nicht mehr vollst√§ndig. Aber Staun√§sse vermeiden! Daher gute Drainageschicht in den Topf einf√ºllen. \n- Brauchen viel D√ºnger, optimal ist ein stickstoffbetonter D√ºnger. Einmal pro Woche d√ºngen, sonst bleiben die Bl√ºten klein. \n- Bl√ºhen von Ende Juni bis Oktober. Einj√§hrig. \n- Einfach von Samen gezogen ab April am Fensterbrett. Ab Mitte Mai kann man direkt auss√§en. Auf ausreichend Abstand zwischen den K√∂rnern achten. \n- Einige Sorten verzweigen sich und bl√ºhen sehr lange.

T√∂pfe sollten gro√ü und schwer sein, damit sie nicht kippen. \n- Zwergsorten f√ºr Balkon: Big smile (35 cm), Pacino (30 cm), Teddyb√§r (70 cm), Sunspot (60 cm), Sunny smile (50 cm), Garden statement (80 cm). \n- Mittelgro√üe Sorten: Waooh (90 cm), Orange sun (140 cm), Piccolo (100 cm), Vanilla Ice (120 cm). \n\n#### Varieties:\n- Wild Mix: https://www.blomsterlandet.se/produkter/vaxter/froer/blomsterfroer/rabattblommor/solros-wilde-mixture-7877/\n- Pollenfree mix: https://www.blomsterlandet.se/produkter/vaxter/froer/blomsterfroer/snittblommor/solros-mix-62261/\n- Wahoo: https://www.blomsterlandet.se/produkter/vaxter/froer/blomsterfroer/rabattblommor/solros-waooh-72114/\n- Moonwalker, buschig: https://www.blomsterlandet.se/produkter/vaxter/froer/blomsterfroer/rabattblommor/solros-moonwalker-7875/\n- Ring of fire: https://www.blomsterlandet.se/produkter/vaxter/froer/blomsterfroer/snittblommor/solros-ring-of-fire-72111/\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226203606.png)\n- Pachine Gold, buschig und klein: https://www.blomsterlandet.se/produkter/vaxter/froer/blomsterfroer/rabattblommor/solros-pacino-gold-7872/\n\n### Hollyhocks / Alcea / Stockrosen / Stockros\n- Brauchen Platz f√ºr Wurzeln, gen√ºgend N√§hrstoffe und einen sonnigen, windgesch√ºtzten Platz. Vertragen keinen N√§sse. \n- Anzucht: im ersten Jahr bilden sich Blattrosetten, die Bl√ºte zeigt sich im zweiten Jahr. Die Blumen sind winterhart und k√∂nnen in milden Regionen ohne extra Schutz am Balkon √ºberwintern. \n- Grow up to 6 ft. tall. Need a stake for support. \n- Come in single and double flower varieties. \n- Need full sun and shelter from wind. Can break in too much wind. \n- Pots should be as large as possible. Well draining soil. \n- Plant directly in May or June. Easy to grow from seed: keep moist, in warm and sunny spot. After about a month, transfer to larger pot and move outdoors. \n- Best to grow against a wall or balcony railing. \n- No need for fertilising or much care. Water once a week, perhaps more during hot weather. \n- Prune off flower stems after the seed heads have burst and cut back the plant in autumn once it's died back. \n- Hollyhocks are perennials, so you could move the pots somewhere sheltered over winer and ensure the roots still get some water. If cared for properly, the plant should sprout again in spring. \n\n\n## Plants\n\n### Strawberries\nTips for huge harvest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MKkBy93yqA\n\n\n#### Varieties\n- Smultron \"Regina\": https://www.plantagen.se/smultron-regina-rod-536017.html\n\n#### Bought\n- Weibulls Junior M√•nadssmultron R√ºgen\n\n\n## Soil\n\nTorvfri planteringsjord\n\nMedelhavsjord\n\nBlomjord med leca\n\nHow much soil do I need?  https://www.gartengnom.net/rechner/volumen/\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.717530395Z","tags":null},"/projects/plants/Plants-to-get":{"title":"Plants to get","content":"## For full sunlight\n\n### Jade plant (Crassula argentea)\n- Need at least 4h of sunlight each day, so perfect for s south-facing windowsill. \n- Succulent, so drought-tolerant.

Amino acids containing an amino group bonded direclty to the alpha-carbon are referred to as __alpha-amino acids__. \n\npKa = acid dissociation constant. It indicates whether an acid is a strong acid or a weak acid. The lower the pKa, the more easily it gives up its proton. The higher the pKa, the more tightly the proton is held. Strong acids have pKa of less than zero. \n\nAt physiological pH (pH 7), most aas have a **COO-** group and a **NH3+** group and are therefore zwitterions: -NH3+-CHR-COO-. This form predominates at pH values between the two pKas (the pKa of the amino group and the pKa of the carboxyl group). The so-called \"neutral\" forms -NH2-CHR-COOH are not present to any measurable degree at neutral pH. At strongly acidic conditions (pH \u003c 3), the carboxylate group becomes protonated (-COOH), resulting in -NH3+-CHR-COOH. At strongly basic conditions (pH \u003e 10) the ammonio group is deprotonated to give -NH2-CHR-COO-.

Limited capacity to synthesize amino acids using inorganic nitrogen sources. They are therefore dependent on preformed amino acids being present in the growth medium as a source of nitrogen.\n- Contribute to the taste and texture of fermented products and inhibit food spoilage bacteria by **producing growth-inhibiting substances** and **large amounts of lactic acid**.\n- Ability to degrade different carbohydrates and related compounds (but depending on species and strain!).\n- Spoilage organisms among LAB typically grow slowly with lactic acid as a carbon source. \n\n\n## Fermentation pathways\nPresence or absence of the key cleavage enzymes of the glycolysis pathway (fructose 1,6-diphosphate) and the pentose phosphate pathway. \n\n### Homofermentative\n**Glycolysis pathway**. Some _lactobacilli_ and most species of _enterococci_, _lactococci, _pediococci_, _streptococci_, _tetragenococci_, and _vagococci_. \n- Under excess gluose and limited oxygen: one mole of **glucose** yields two moles of **pyruvate** (through glycolysis pathway). Oxidation of NADH to NAD, while puryvate gets reduced to **lactate**. The process yields two molecules ATP per glucose consumed. \n- Free glucose is transported into the cell and phosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphate by an ATP-dependent hexose kinase. Other sugars (mannose, fructose) enter the major pathway at the level of glucose-6-phosphate or fructore-6-phosphate after isomerization or phosphorylation, or both. \n- Alternatively, some species use the phosphoenolpyrucate (PEP) sugar phosphtransferase system (PTS); either for galactose only or for all sugars. \n\n\n### Heterofermentative\n**Pentose phosphate pathway**. *Leuconostocs*, some _lactobacilli_, _oenococci_, and _weissella_ species. \n- One mole **glucose** --\u003e **glucose-6-phosphate** --\u003e dehydrogenated to **6-phosphogluconate** --\u003e decarboxylated to yield one **CO2**. \n- **Pentose-5-phosphate** is cleaved into one molecule of glyceraldehyde phosphate (**GAP**) and one molecule of **acetyl phosphate** --\u003e GAP is further metabolized into **lactate**; acetyl phosphate is reduced to **ethanol** via acetyl-CoA and acetaldehyade intermediates. \n\n## Proteolytic system\nSince the quantities of free amino acids present in their environment are not sufficient to support the growth of bacteria to a high cell density, they require a proteolytic system capable of hydrolyzing peptides and proteins in order to obtain essential amino acids. All dairy lactococci used for acidification of milk (e.g., in cheese manufacture) have proteolytic activity. The lactococcal proteolytic system consists of enzymes outside the cytoplasmic membrane, transport systems, and intracellular peptidases. The proteolytic activity of LAB contributes additionally to the development of the flavor, aroma and texture of fermented products. For many varieties of cheeses, such as Swiss and Cheddar, desirable \"flavor tones\" are derived by proteolysis.\n\n\n\n## Lactobacillaceae\n\n- 3 major subgroups, \u003e250 species of which 84 are on the International Dairy Federation list of food cultures and around 20 are produced as starter culture or probiotic cultures.\n- New taxonomy since 2020: reclassification into 26 genera: _Lactobacillus_, _Pedicococcus_, _Paralactobacillus_ and 23 novel genera. 16S rRNA similarity allows robust assignment to the new genera.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230226204406.png)\n_(Reclassified genera of lactobacillaceae and their translations.

Some strains of intestinal _Lactobacillaceae_ picked up tetracycline resistance. \n- Main product of fermentative metabolism is lactate, other products may be acetate, ethanol, CO2, formate or succinate. \n\n### Group 1\nHomofermentative, produce lactic acid as major end product (\u003e85%) from glucose. E.g. _L. delbrueckii_ and _L. acidophilus_. Grow at 45¬∫C but not 15¬∫C. \n\n### Group 2\nHomofermentative. Grow at 15¬∫C and show variable growth at 45¬∫C. E.g. _L. casei_ and _L. plantarum_. Can produce more oxidized fermentations (e.g. acetate) when O2 is present. \n\n### Group 3\nHeterofermentative. From glucose they produce lactic acid, ethanol and CO2. E.g. _L. fermentum_ (now called _Limosilactobacillus fermentum_), _L. brevis_ (_Levilactobacillus brevi_) and _L. kefiri_ (_Lentilactobacillus kefiri)_. \n\n\n### Lactobacillus\n- Homofermentative\n- Most species don't ferment pentoses, but they have the ability to ferment a relatively broad spectrum of carbohydrates (e.g. mannitol), and even fructans, starch or glycogen. Metabolic focus on lactose explains the dominance in yogurt and cheese fermentations (esp. of _L. delbrueckii_), as well as the presence in the intestines of suckling pigs.\n\n### Lacticaseibillus\n- Homofermentative\n- Some species ferment pentoses via the phosphoketolase pathway. \n- Several species of it are used as dairy starter cultures and probiotics.\n\n## Different species of _Lactobacillaceae_\n\n### _Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus_\nPreviously _L. bulgaricus_. Ferments glucose to D(-)-lactic acid and also metabolises fructose, mannose and lactose, but not sucrose. Important starter culture for yogurt and cheese. Type strain: ATCC 11842 (DSM 20081). Genome sequence accession number: JQAV00000000.\n\n### _Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii_\nFerments glucose to D(-)-lactic acid and also metabolises sucrose, fructose and mannose, but not lactose. Isolated from vegetables and fermented grains. Type strain: ATCC 9649 (DSM 20074). Genome sequence accession number: AY773949.\n\n### _Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis_\nIncludes strains previously designated as _L. lactis_ and _L. leichmannii_. Ferments glucose do D(-)-lactic acid and also metabolises sucrose, fructose, mannose, maltose and trehalose. Isolated from milk, cheese and grain mash. Type strain: ATCC 12315 (DSM 20072). Genome sequence accession number: AZDE00000000.\n\n### _Lactobacillus acidophilus_\nProduces DL-lactic acid from cellobiose, galactose, lactose, maltose, mannose, sucrose and trehalose. Specific strains have been used as probiotics. Isolated from intestinal tract of humans and animals, human mouth, vagina, sourdough and wine. Type strain: ATCC 4356 (DSM 20079). Genome sequence accession number: AZCS00000000.\n\n### Lactobacillus helveticus\nProduces DL-lactic acid from glucose, galactose, lactose, mannose, and trehaolse, but not cellobiose, mannitol, raffinose and sucrose. Isolated from sour milk, cheese (particularly Emmental and Gruy√®re cheeses). Type strain: ATCC 15009 (DSM 20075). Genome sequence accession number: AZEK00000000.\n\n### _Streptococcus thermophilus_\n_Streptococcus thermophilus_ is an alpha-hemolytic species of the viridans group. The bacterium is found in milk and milk products. It is not a probiotic (it does not survive the stomach) and generally is used in the production of **yogurt** and the manufacture of several types of cheese, especially **Italian and Swiss cheeses**. The organism is a moderate thermophile with an optimal growth rate at **45 ¬∞C**. Although _S. thermophilus_ is closely related to other pathogenic streptococci (such as _S. pneumoniae_ and _S. pyogenes_), _S. thermophilus_ is classified as a non-pathogenic species. It is closely related to _S. salivarius_ in the oral cavity.\n\n\n### _Lactococcus lactis_\nLactococcus is a genus of of LAB with five major species formerly classified as Group N streptococci. The type species for the genus is _L. lactis,_ which has two subspecies, _lactis_ and _cremoris_. Lactococci differ from other lactic acid bacteria by their pH, salt and temperature tolerances for growth.  \n  \n_Lactococcus lactis_ is critical for manufacturing cheeses such as **Cheddar**, **cottage cheese**, **cream cheese**, **Camembert**, **Roquefort** and **Brie**, as well as other dairy products like cultured butter, **buttermilk**, **sour cream** and **kefir**. The bacterium can be used in single strain starter cultures, or in mixed strain cultures with other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230226130546.png)\n_(Lactococcus lactis.

From: https://textbookofbacteriology.net/lactics_5.html)_\n\n### Lactococcus genome\nPartly due to their industrial relevance, both _Lactococcus lactis_ subspecies (_lactis_ and _cremoris_) are widely used as generic LAB models for research. _L. lactis ssp. cremoris_, used in the production of hard cheeses, is represented by the laboratory strains **LM0230** and **MG1363**. \nCurrently, there are two _L. lactis ssp. cremoris_ that have been sequenced for public release, one of which is _L. lactic ssp. cremoris_ MG1363 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1855848/. \n\nSimilarly, _L. lactis ssp. lactis_ is employed in soft cheese fermentations, with the workhorse strain **IL1403**, ubiquitous in LAB research laboratories. In 2001, the genome of strain IL1403 was sequenced leading to increased understanding of LAB genomics and related applications. \n\nThe genome sequence reveals 12 enzymes called aminotransferases, some of which are used to break down complex, branched, ring-shaped, and sulfur-containing amino acids. The molecules produced when the amino acids are degraded are very important for cheese flavor. Understanding which amino acids are broken down by which enzymes could give cheese makers greater control over flavor and fragrance of their cheeses.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Bifidobacterium\nBifidobacterium is not included in the traditional Lactic Acid Bacteria due to its genetic unrelatedness, but the bacterium has a habitat that overlaps with LAB, and it has a metabolism that produces lactic acid as a primary end-product of fermentation.¬†Bifidobacteria are strictly anaerobic and are a prominant Gram-positve bacterium in the large intestine (colon). _Bifidobacterium infantum_ is the predominant bacterium in the intestine of breast-fed infants because mother's milk contains a specific growth factor that enriches for the growth of the bacterium.\n\nAmong 30 species, those recognized as probiotics include:  \n- _B. adolescentis_\n- _B. breve_\n- _B. longum_\n- _B. animalis_ \n- _B. infantis_\n- _B. thermophilum_ \n- _B. bifidum_\n- _B. lactis_\n\n## Probiotics\n\n[Pre-, pro- and postbiotics](projects/fermentation/Pre-,%20pro-%20and%20postbiotics.md)\n\n\n## Dairy fermentation\nSee my \u0026 Max Graze's [Dairy Ferments Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv4NzMfaMoGOAlro\u0026inviteToken=be8dca27eeaaa4e313349e17c353744edd29320c373d962cbea4abf36fcd06dc\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=product_team\u0026utm_content=transactional-alerts)\n\n[Dairy fermentation notes](projects/fermentation/Dairy%20fermentation%20notes.md)\n\n[Plant-based dairy fermentation notes](projects/attachments/Plant-based%20dairy%20fermentation%20notes.md)\n\n\n## Vegetable fermentation\n\n[Vegetable fermentation notes](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20fermentation%20notes.md)\n\n\n## Bacteriocins and antibiotics from LAB\n**Nisin** produced by _Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis_ has been studied extensively. It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The primary target is believed to be the cell membrane. Unlike some other antimicrobial peptides, nisin does not need a receptor for its interaction with the cell membrane; however, the presence of a membrane potential is required.\n\nNisin is a natural preservative present in cheese made with _Lactococcus lactis_ ssp. _lactis_, but it is also used as a preservative in heat processed and low pH foods. Since nisin cannot be synthesized chemically, the nisin-producing _Lactococcus lactis_ strains are used for its industrial synthesis.  \n  \nThe first established use of nisin was as a preservative in processed cheese products, but numerous other applications in preservation of foods and beverages have been identified. It is currently recognized as a safe food preservative in approximately 50 countries. Nisin has been used as a preservative in various pasteurized dairy products and canned vegetables, baked, high-moisture flour products, and pasteurized liquid eggs. There is interest in the use of nisin in natural cheese production. Considerable research has been carried out on the anti-listerial properties of nisin in foods and a number of applications have been proposed. Uses of nisin to control spoilage lactic acid bacteria have been identified in beer, wine, alcohol production, and high acid foods such as salad dressings. Production of highly purified nisin preparations has led to interest in the use of nisin for human ulcer therapy and mastitis control in cattle.\n\nAlthough nisin is today the only bacteriocin that reached commercial status, approved worldwide as a natural food preservative, many other bacteriocins may soon reach similar status.

Iron interfacing on the ones where necessary:\n\t1. 2x piece 11 on main fabric\n\t2. 1x piece 6 on main fabric\n2. Transfer the markings for the fly on the front pieces to the fabric (on the wrong side), then baste stitch with a contrasting thread so it appears on the right side. \n3. Only on right-side front piece: Press 1 cm fold on the fly tab.\n4. Only left-side front piece: Trim away the 1 cm fly tab (that you just pressed to the back on the right-side front piece)\n5. On each of the front pieces, sew a form tape interfacing (1 cm width, non-stretch) along the waist line.  _Helps to prevent deformation and stretching of the waist._\n6. If Italian pockets are done: fuse a 3 cm wide piece of interfacing all along the future pocket opening on the front pieces (on wrong side of fabric).\n7. Overlock the insides of the legs of the front and back pieces. On the right-side front, only up to the fly where the tab starts, but no the fly tab (that was pressed to the inside). Also overlock the bottom parts of the legs on the front and back pieces, as well as the outside of the legs on the back pieces. _Be careful not to stretch the fabric, especially when overlocking the inside of the crotch!_\n8. Press a 4 cm hem on the bottom of the front and back piece legs.\n9. Transfer the markings for the back pockets onto the right and wrong sides of the fabric on the back pieces. \n10. Sew the darts on the back pieces and press them towards the crotch. \n11. Iron on interfacing where the back pocket openings will be.\n12. On each of the back pieces, sew a form tape interfacing (1 cm width, non-stretch) along the waist line.  _Helps to prevent deformation and stretching of the waist._\n13. Back pocket lining: transfer the placement of the pocket to the right side of the back pocket lining piece. \n14. Italian pockets: Front pocket linings 2x piece 10: fold wrong sides together in the middle (line up notches - the top and the bottom curve should match) and iron. Front pocket opening 2x piece 8: overlock the short part and the longest part only. Then place the front pocket opening wrong side to wrong side to the front pocket lining and stitch the two pieces with a long stitch (4) together, a few mm away from the edge. Pin the wrong side of the pocket lining to the right side of the front leg at the pocket opening. Stitch along the outer edge at 1 cm. Then press the seam allowance towards the pocket lining and understitch it in place (2 mm away from the other stitching line). Then iron the pocket towards the back of the front leg. Then sew the pocket shut with French seams. For that, fold the pocket lining right sides together along the lower edge. Sew with an overlocker along the bottom edge at 8mm (so that 3 mm will be cut off and sewn at 5 mm). Then fold the pocket inside out, press, and sew over the newly made stitch line at 6 mm, so that the overlocker stitching is encased. Then align the top edge of the trouser leg with the pocket and stitch along at 5 mm to hold it in place. Also, stitch a bit (at 5 mm) on the side of the trouser leg, below the pocket opening, to keep the pocket in place. \n15. Back pocket (welt pocket): Cut a 2cm wide x 8cm long strip on the main fabric, then fold and press like a bias tape. Stitch along the long edge as close to the edge as possible, then shorten the strip to 6.5 cm. Fold the strip in half to form a little loop. On the back trouser leg with the welt pocket, pin the loop pointing upwards in the middle of the outlined welt pocket. Stitch at 5 mm to keep in place.

Quite cropped in the front (is it supposed to be shorter in the front than in the back?) - might make it a little bit longer next time. \nI definitely want to make this shirt in different fabrics, and also make a dress hack. It looks lovely, the sleeves are exactly as I like them - slightly puffy, perfectly on the shoulders, good length and not too tight. The only adjustment was that I closed the cleavage a bit higher because my bra was peeking out. \n\n### Pattern\nFriday Pattern Company, size S. See [Donny shirt pictures \u0026 fabric](projects/sewing/Donny%20shirt%20pictures%20\u0026%20fabric.md)\n\n### Fabric\n#### Version 1\nSize S. I had about 1 m2 of linen left from my [Tula pants](projects/sewing/Tula%20pants%20\u0026%20shorts%20(Papercut%20Patterns).md) and managed to squeeze the Donny shirt out of it, with disregard of the grainline. I also had to make the collar in a different fabric and chose a simple quilting cotton. It's visible, but I think that looks quite nice actually. \nVery short, especially in the front. Belly shows when I move.\n\n![|500](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230722173438.png)\n\n\n#### Version 2\nSize S. Made with leftover fabric from [Lotta dress (Tilly and the Buttons)](projects/sewing/Lotta%20dress%20(Tilly%20and%20the%20Buttons).md) - a dark green and black, flowery Lyocell viscose from Kattun Stoffe. I didn't have quite enough, so for some of the collar pieces I used some black fabric that I got from Tante Irmi, probably also a viscose or some polyester. Feels quite similar in weight and structure to the main fabrick. \nI lengthened the front and back by 3.5 cm, which resulted in a very good length for me. Again, I hand-stitched the collar close much higher up than intended by the pattern, otherwise my bra would show all the time. \n\n![|500](Donny%20blouse%2007.jpeg)\n\n![|500](Donny%20blouse%2006.jpeg)\n\n#### Version 3\nRust-coloured Lyocell viscose from Kattun Stoffe for Mama. Size S. \n\n![|500](Donny%20blouse%2005.jpeg)\n\n![|500](Donny%20blouse%2004.jpeg)\n\n\n#### Version 4\nGingham cotton for Angie. Size S. \nThis time, instead of hand-sewing the collar more closed as the last step, I moved the collar marking from size S to a size 4XL. This worked really well to get the collar opening to a height that I liked. \n\n![|500](Donny%20blouse%2001.jpeg)\n\n![|500](Donny%20blouse%2002.jpeg)![|500](Donny%20blouse%2003.jpeg)","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.717530395Z","tags":null},"/projects/sewing/Donny-shirt-pictures-fabric":{"title":"Donny shirt pictures \u0026 fabric","content":"Instagram hashtag: #DonnyShirt https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/donnyshirt/\n\nhttps://fridaypatterncompany.com/products/donny-shirt-pdf-pattern\nFriday Pattern Company\n\n## Suggested fabrics\nFor 115 cm width: 1.3 m.

The easy silhouette of the Heather makes it look great in a variety of fabrics.  \n\nMAIN FABRIC: Any woven fabric with a bit of weight to it is great: Linen, suiting, twill, denim, canvas. Avoid fabrics that can't take a press since there is a fair amount of fusible interfacing involved in this project. \n137-162 cm width: 1.7 m (size S or M) \n114 cm width: 2.2 m (size S or M)\n\nLINING FABRIC: Typically you want to line your jackets with something that will easily slide on and off over other fabrics. Anything a little bit slippery would work. Rayon, silk, a cotton with a tight weave. \n114 cm width: 1.6 m (size S or M)\n\nWOVEN INTERFACING: You want the type that looks like fabric (not the papery kind) and is fusible. The papery kind will work in a pinch but it is worth investing in the woven stuff as it will really give your blazer a nicer feel. \n114 cm width: 0.8 m (size S or M)\n\nKNIT INTERFACING: This interfacing also looks like fabric but has stretch, it will reinforce the collar and lapel without making them too stiff! \n114 cm width: 0.8 m (size S or M)\n\n## Sew-along\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FegU4C7zJ8\n\n\n## Pictures\nhttps://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/heatherblazer/\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220911114649.png)\n_Credit: https://www.instagram.com/p/CKmkrx8FV7H/ (@siri_kate)\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.717530395Z","tags":null},"/projects/sewing/Helmi-trench-blouse-and-tunic-dress":{"title":"Helmi trench blouse and tunic dress","content":"[#helmitrenchblouse](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/helmitrenchblouse/)\n[#helmitunicdress](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/helmitunicdress/)\n\n\n### Pattern\nNamed Clothing, size 38.\n\n\n### Fabric\n1.

It's a simple dress that you just throw on and you're styled. No buttons, no zips, no fastenings. With the short sleeves it's a nice mix between casual and elegant looking. Love the fabric: it's a bit heavier than \"normal\" viscose, has a very nice drape, and doesn't crease much. \n\n### Pattern\nTilly and the Buttons, size 4 https://shop.tillyandthebuttons.com/products/lotta\nKnee-length with short sleeves.\n### Fabric\n100% Lenzing Ecovero Viscose from Kattun Stoffe, Floral shade bottle green, 165 g/m2, 1.45 m width. Suggested length: 2.5 m, actual needed: 2 m (since skirt part was cut against the grain). \n\n### Adjustments\nShort sleeves, cut length to just above knee, a bit less volume (i.e. width) in the skirt section. Added deep side pockets (cut in the same fabric). Since I cut the skirt part against the grain (not obvious difference with this fabric and the pattern), it would probably have even fit on **1.7 m** if I had made the pockets from a different material. If even more volume is taken out of the skirt, then it would need even less fabric. \n\nAfter a while the neck facing really bothered me, because it always looked sloppy. So I made some bias binding with leftover fabric and sewed it all around the neckline. Now it's slightly bulky, but it doesn't bother me, and everything feels so much more secure and falls better. \n\n### Next time\n- Get less fabric than indicated in pattern description (see above).\n- Bias binding instead of facing for the neckline! The facing always flips up and peeks out. \n- Slightly wider elastic, I like the look of that (similar to [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfLf1UFMzfJ/)).\n- Maybe try a longer version with patch pocket in a double gauze, like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CevjUlwsH4J/?)?\n- In Gingham fabric like [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrTy5Yws9p8/)?

Alle Teile im Stoff ausschneiden, Markierungen √ºbertragen, b√ºgeln.\n2. Knopfleiste: Bei beiden Vorderteilen (Achtung: m√ºssen spiegelverkehrt sein!), die vordere mittlere) Kante 1 cm nach links umb√ºgeln. Dann nochmal 3 cm bei der selben Kante umb√ºgeln, und mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Mit geradem Stich (Stichl√§nge 2.5) knapp neben der umgeschlagenen Kante die ganze L√§nge runtern√§hen. \n3. **Knopfl√∂cher** (nur im rechten Vorderteil!): Knopfl√∂cher-Markierungen auf den Stoff √ºbertragen (sowohl vertikal als auch horizontal). Dann mit Knopflochfu√ü und richtigen Abmessungen (h√§ngt von der Knopfgr√∂√üe ab) die Knopfl√∂cher n√§hen.\n4. **Brusttasche(n)**: Mit Vorlage die Taschenposition(en) auf den Vorderteilen markieren. Dann das Taschenteil oben 2 cm nach links umfalten und b√ºgeln. Dann nochmal 2 cm umb√ºgeln und mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Dann knappkantig dr√ºbern√§hen. Dann alle restrlichen Kanten 1 cm nach links umb√ºgeln. _W√§re es nicht besser die 3 anderen Kanten zuerst zu b√ºgeln und dann die oberste?? Schaut sauberer aus._ Dann auf das Vorderteile stecken und auf 3 Seiten knappkantig von der rechten Seite ann√§hen. \n5. R√ºckenteil: Die Mittelfalte in R√ºckenteil und Passen (yokes) b√ºgeln. Am R√ºckenteil, die Knips zur Mittelfalte legen (links) und feststecken (d.h. Knips genau auf die hintere Mitte legen). In 5 mm Abstand von der Kante √ºber die Kellerfalte n√§hen um sie zu fixieren. Eine Passe rechts auf rechts auf das R√ºckenteil legen. Die andere Passe unter das R√ºckenteil (rechte Seite von Passe auf linke Seite von R√ºckenteil) legen. Alle Ecken und Kanten der drei Teile sch√∂n aufeinanderlegen. In 1 cm Abstand alle drei Teile entlang der Oberkante zusammenn√§hen.  B√ºgeln. \n6. Schultern√§hte schlie√üen: R√ºckenteil rechts nach oben hinlegen, beide Vorderteile rechts auf rechts darauf, an Schulterkanten ausrichten. Mit Nadeln fixieren, aber nur **eine** Passenlage (die √§u√üere)  und das Vorderteil! Dann Vorderteile mit R√ºckenteil einrollen, das ganze Stoffpaket wenden (liegt jetzt auf den eingerollten Teilen), und die andere (innere) Passe um das Stoffpaket einschlagen sodass die Schultern√§hte der beiden Passen wieder aufeinandertreffen. Mit Nadeln festestecken und in 1 cm Abstand die Schultern√§hte n√§hen (3 Stofflagen). Dann das ganze Stoffpaket durch das Halsroch rausziehen. N√§hte b√ºgeln. \n7. √Ñrmel: √Ñrmel rechts auf rechts auf das Hauptteil legen. √Ñrmelknips genau auf die Schulternaht legen. Dann die Ecken des √Ñrmelteils mit den anderen Knipsen am Hauptteil angleichen und mit Nadeln fixieren. Mit 1.5 cm Nahtzugabe die √Ñrmel festn√§hen. B√ºgeln, sodass die Nahtzugaben zum √Ñrmel zeigen. Kanten vers√§ubern. \n8. Seitennaht schlie√üen (mit French seams): Bluse mit Vorderseite nach oben hinlegen, √Ñrmeln√§hte und Seitenn√§hte aufeinander (**links auf links**). Mit Nadeln fixieren. Mit 5 mm Nahtzugabe n√§hen. Die Naht platt b√ºgeln und mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Dann von der linken Seite (Stoffteile liegen rechts auf rechts) knapp neben der anderen Naht (also mit ca. 6 mm Abstand) √Ñrmel und Seitennaht entlang n√§hen. Naht platt b√ºgeln mit Nahtzugaben zur Vorderseite hin. \n9. Kragen: Beide Kragenteile rechts auf rechts aufeinenderlegen. Die kurzen Seiten und die lange obere Seite mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Mit 1 cm Nahtzugabe an diesen drei Seiten entlang n√§hen. Ecken diagonal abschneiden, dann Kragen umdrehen und b√ºgeln. _Optional: den ganzen Kragen in 5 mm Abstand rundum absteppen._ Einen der Stege mit Rundunden nach oben (und rechts nach oben)hinlegen, die Knipse mit der ungen√§hten Kante des Kragens abstimmen. Dann den anderen Steg rechts auf rechts drauflegen (der Kragen ist also zwischen den zwei Stegen), und die gesamte obere Kante feststecken. Mit 1 cm Abstand n√§hen: die Rundungen der Stege, dann weiter entlang der Kante des Kragenteils. _Achtung: nicht direkt an der Kante der Stege zu n√§hen beginnen, sondern 1 cm frei lassen (am Anfang und am Ende._ Nahtzugaben an den Rundungen k√ºrzen und einschneiden. Dann alles umdrehen und b√ºgeln. \n10. Kragen ann√§hen: Kragen-Steg-Teil rechts auf rechts auf das Vorderteil legen, Ecke mit Nahtzugabe genau an die Kante. Nur den inneren Steg mit Nadeln auf das Vorderteil stecken. Das selbe mit der Ecke auf der anderen Seite. Dann die ganze Kante des Stegs entlang an das Hauptteil stecken. Mit 1 cm Abstand ann√§hen. **Sicherstellen dass die Ecken des Stegs wirklich genau mit den Kanten des Vorderteils abschlie√üen!** Hauptteil umdreehen, d.h. mit links nach unten auflegen. Dann die Nahtzugaben des √§u√üeren Stegs nach innen falten, ca. 1 cm, aber soweit dass es ein bisschen √ºber die Naht am Hauptteil hinausgeht, d.h. dass diese Naht verdeckt wird. Alles entlang mit Nadeln abstecken. Dann auf der rechten Seite entlang n√§hen, m√∂glichst nahe neben der Falte. _Auf der linken Seite kontrollieren ob alle Stofflagen erwischt wurden._\n![](projects/attachments/Noella%20blouse%2002.png)\n11. Optional: Knopflock am Kragen: Horizontales Knopfloch am Ende des Stegs n√§hen. \n![](projects/attachments/Noella%20blouse%2004.png)\n\n12. S√§ume: An der Unterkante der Bluse 1 cm umb√ºgeln. Dann nochmal 1 cm umb√ºgeln, mit Nadeln fixieren, m√∂glichst nahe an der umgeb√ºgelten Kante festn√§hen. Das selbe mit den √Ñrmeln. \n13. Kn√∂pfe ann√§hen. \n\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.717530395Z","tags":null},"/projects/sewing/Paola-Workwear-Jacket":{"title":"Paola Workwear Jacket","content":"https://fabrics-store.com/jackets/paola-workwear-jacket-pattern-type-pdf\nThe Fabrics Store (free pattern!)\n\n## Suggested fabrics\n\n\n## Pictures\n\n![|300](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230410203547.png)\n(_https://www.instagram.com/p/CqqDI7-Mpia/.

This allows the sleeve lining a bit more room to move in there, and removes any tightness. \n- Added 1\" to the center back to form a pleat to allow plenty of moving room, and again avoid any tightness. \n- Instead of 'bagging' my lining, I serged all the edges, and basted it at the side seams, shoulders and fronts, and spent a lovely time hand stitching it in place with an invisible stitch while listening to some podcasts. I love doing these little hand stitched finishes. The basting stitches just held everything in place so it didn't shift around while I was hand sewing.

Iron on interfacing on pieces 10 and 11 (and optionally also 8 and 9).\n\n### Leg pieces\n1. Attach bottom pieces (Front hem, pieces 5; Back hem, pieces 4) of legs to all 4 legs (pieces 1, 2 and 3) - right sides together. Match the notches. \n2. Overlock the seams together, then press the seam allowances towards the bottom of the trouser leg. \n3. Top stitch on the right side of the trouser legs at 0.25''/**0.6 cm** away from the seam on top of the seam allowance. Use a slightly longer stitch length than for the normal sewing.\n4. Sew the darts on the back leg pieces and press towards the side seams.\n5. Overlock the inside rise of the front legs.\n6. Overlock the inside rise of the back legs.\n7. Overlock the inside of the front and back legs.\n\n\n### Pockets\n1. Overlock the shortest and the longest sides (i.e. the interior edges) of Front Pocket Facing (pieces 6).\n2. Stitch the **wrong** side of piece 6 to **right** side (i.e. the nice patterned side that you want on the inside of the pockets in the end) of Pocket Bags (pieces 7) along the serged edges with **0.6 cm** seam allowance. \n3. Right sides together, align the pocket bags with the front trouser legs, stitch with **1 cm** seam allowance. Pivot the needle in the corner to get a sharp edge. When finished stitching, clip the sharp point for clean turning.\n4. Press the seams of the pocket bag open and turn the pocket bags. Then top stitch at 0.3 cm from the finished edge through both layers, sandwiching the seam allowance in between those layers.\n5. Overlock the lower, rounded edges of the pocket bag together to close the pocket bag.\n6. Then, fold the pocket bag in on itself and align with the outer edge of the front leg. Align notches, Stay stitch on the top (waist) and the side (hip) at the pocket opening, for about 4 cm. Don't stitch over the pocket opening though!\n7. Topstitch a little **0.6 cm** wide rectangle on short end of the pocket opening through all layers of fabric. This is to hold the pocket down so it doesn't flip inside out later.\n\n### Back pockets\n1. Fold over the top of the back pockets by 1.9 cm, press. Fold over again by **1.9 cm**, press.\n2. Topstitch the folded-over hem **0.3 cm** from the **inner** edge. \n3. Overlock the other sides of the back pockets, fold over by **0.9 cm**, press.\n4. Line up one of the back pockets with the marks on the back legs and top stitch **0.3 cm** from the edge to the back leg. Reinforce the openings by sewing a little triangle. \n5. Pin on the second back pocket on the trouser leg. Before sewing on the second back pocket, make triple sure that they line up, even after the two back legs are sewn together! \n\n### Fly and zipper\n1. Fold fly extension (piece 8) right sides together in half and stitch the bottom closed with **1.27 cm**  seam allowance. Clip the corner and fold inside out.\n2. Press the fly extension and sew the raw edge closed with **0.6 cm** seam allowance. Overlock the raw edge. \n3. Fly front (piece 9): overlock the curved edge. \n4. Place right and left front legs right sides together on top of each other (there will be a little overhang on the right leg, which is normal). Stitch the rise at **1.27 cm** seam allowance up to the drill hole marked on the right leg pattern piece. _Follow the piece without overhang for the seam allowance._ Press the seam open.\n5. On the fly extension: Make sure you mark the the notch towards the bottom on the unserged short end. Line up the zipper (right side up)  so the zipper **stop** is where this notch is. Line up the zipper tape with the serged edge of the fly extension (align top of zipper on the serged short edge) and stay stitch to keep the zipper in place.\n6. With right sides together, stitch the fly extension to the right leg, **1.27 cm** from serged edge. Stop at the end of the zipper end, approx. **1.5 cm** before the end of the fly extension.\n7. Fold the fly extension open and press the seam allowance towards the side of the trouser leg. Then top stitch along the zipper and stop again 1.5 cm before the end of the fly extension.\n8. Fly front: with right sides together, sew onto the left leg with **1.27 cm** seam allowance, all the way (as much as possible) to the end of the fly front. Then press the seams open and press the fly front onto the inside of the leg.\n9. Open the zipper and stitch it right side to the right side of the fly front. NB: The zipper teeth must be **1.27 cm** away from the edge of the fly front. Don't line up the fly front flush with the opposite side of the zipper opening, it should overlap a bit. Make sure to align the waistline of both legs. _Tip: Use magic tape to glue the zipper to the fabric and see if everything lines up nicely. _\n10. On the outside of the left leg, draw a nice J-curve (using the fly front patttern) from the waste band to the end of the zipper. The drawn J-curve should follow the fly front on the inside, about 0.6 cm away from its edge. Pin the fly extension out of the way on the inside to not stitch over it. Then stitch on the outside with a fairly long straight stitch (too short doesn't look good!) along the drawn curve. Use the handwheel to get around the curve nicely. The J-curve ends by stitching just about across the whole zipper end. \n11. On the inside, move the fly extension over the fly front. Then on the outside, make a little bartack to keep the fly extension in place. \n\n### Assemble legs\n1. Back legs: with right sides together at the rise, stitch with **1.27 cm** seam allowance. Press the seam allowances apart. \n2. Back + front legs: with right sides together, stitch the outside seams with **1.27 cm** seam allowance. Make sure to line up the seams on the leg extensions nicely. \n3. Overlock and press the seams together towards the back of the trousers. Then top stitch the seam allowances to the back legs, **0.6 cm** from the seam. \n4. Sew the front and back leg inseams right sides together with 1.27 cm seam allowance. Press the seam allowances apart. \n\n### Waist band\n1. Fold the belt loop (piece 12) in half and press. Fold both raw edges in to meet, then press again. \n2. Top stitch the belt loop piece along both long sides **0.3 cm** from the edge. \n3. Cut belt loop piece every **7.6 cm** to get 5 pieces of equal length. \n4. Line up the belt loops along the waist band, then stay stitch along the whole waist band at **0.6 cm** and secure the belt loops in place at the same time. \n5. Line up right sides together one each of left waistband (piece 10) and of right waste band (piece 11). Stitch along the short side on the curved side at 1.27 cm. Press the seams open.\n6. Put the resulting two long waistband pieces right sides together on top of each other. Sew along the inner curve, as well as the short sides, at 1.27 cm seam allowance.\n7. Clip the corners of the sewn seam allowance. \n8. Turn the waist band right side out and press flat. \n9. Waist band should sit nice and flush on the left side of the zipper opening, as well as nice and flush on the right side of the zipper opening. Match up the notches with the side seams and the back seam with the back seam.

Both variations have a discreet and elegant hidden button placket.\n\n![|300](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240113154429.png)\n\n### Azure shirt and dress (Atelier Scammit)\nhttps://thefoldline.com/product/azur-shirt-and-dress/\nAzur is a feminine-cut shirt with long sleeves which can be rolled up with tabs for a casual look. The shoulder, offset to the front, is ruched, echoing the gathers on the back. There are two collar options: a shirtwaist collar (simple and elegant) or a Victorian collar (equally pretty if worn open or closed). The sleeves have a tearproof tab, two ease pleats and either a simple cuff or flounce cuff. The shirt can be finished with a straight cut or rounded hemline. It features a French seam finish with an all-in-one facing yoke. Azur can also be made as a dress.\n\n![|300](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240113154618.png)\n## Tops\n### Nature Top (Thread + Sprout)\nhttps://www.threadandsprout.com/tutorials/make-your-own-nature-top\n\n### Donny shirt (Friday Pattern Company)\nhttps://fridaypatterncompany.com/products/donny-shirt-pdf-pattern\nBoxy pull-on top, dartless, with a lapel collar and (optional) patch pocket.

What I found particularly interesting was to see the differences in tree structure between different species: the oaks with their deep furrows in the bark and wood, often twisted into waves; the telegraph-mast-straight elms; the many-stemmed ash. Lots of dead wood around, which was interesting to observe in detail: all the mushrooms and bugs and hollowed out pieces, the mushy, spongy remains after fungal degradation, the dark or lighter colours of the trees - some completely black as if burned. \n\nWe also heard a lot of different birds, including several types of woodpeckers (identified with Duncan's bird call app). \n\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8325.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8316.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8309.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8296.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8289.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/DSCF8328.jpeg)","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.721530431Z","tags":null},"/trips/Inlandsbanan":{"title":"Inlandsbanan","content":"\nhttps://res.inlandsbanan.se/\nGoes from Kristinehamn to G√§llivare (1300 km), via Mora, √ñstersund and Jokkmokk.

Started on Wednesday, finished on Easter Sunday (= 5 days). In total we walked **127.7 km**. \n\n### Day 1: Vittsj√∂ - H√∂rlinge\nWe took the morning train from Helsingborg to Vittsj√∂, via H√§ssleholm. Vittsj√∂ is tiny, but has a small supermarket, which wasn't the case for many other places we came through. But with our backpacks full of food anyway, we quickly turned into the forest. Laika was SO happy to be in the forest again, full on zoomies. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2011%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2014%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nSome puddles along the way were still frozen. We came past some small farms with friendly and curious horses and some ruins of old mills. The forest was a mix of calming pine forest with thick moss covers, and almost autumnal-looking beech and oak forests. We only stopped briefly for lunch, because as soon as we stopped we cooled down quite quickly. Maximum temperature on day 1 was around 5 ¬∫C. The ground was at different times saturated with water and a bit muddy. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2019%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2023%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nAt Aggarps skola, we climbed a steep hill with many boulders and then walked along a ridge towards H√•gnarp, and then down towards Vedema with its many walking paths. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2036%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2037%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2042%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nWe passed some sad-looking farm ruins at Jontustorp and then left Sk√•neleden to reach our first destination, H√∂rlinge Guesthouse. The house was big and a bit cold. We cooked some dinner (tacos with re-hydrated soy-mince and sliced apples), watched an episode of Star Trek Voyager, had a shower, then cuddled up in bed and immediately fell asleep. \n\n### Day 2: H√∂rlinge - H√§ssleholm\nWe woke to some snow on the ground, -2¬∫C and sunshine. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2047%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nBack on Sk√•neleden, we walked along a magical little forest trail, the snow twinkling in the sun, meltwater dripping from the trees, birds singing. We had a little lie-down on the moss, because it looked so inviting.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2060%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nNearing Finja, we had to cross a busy highway-like road, then find our way through some swamp area with barbed wire, then walk a kilometer along the busy road again with trucks and cars thundering past. Definitely the least pleasant part of the whole walk. We were glad when the path took us away from it again. We entered the area around Finjasj√∂n and had lunchbreak in a wetland area on a beautifully situated but somewhat rotten wooden platform. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2065%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nWe walked past the oldest known human settlement in Sweden ([Sveriges √§ldsta boplats](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Sweden's+oldest+settlement/@56.1630026,13.6941526,16.37z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x465157fd956d1d5f:0xdd32decfcdfb7edd!8m2!3d56.1621371!4d13.6968996!16s%2Fg%2F11fx7s0f50?hl=en); 14000 years ago), then had to backtrack a bit because our path was completely flooded. That happened a few more times on the track around Finjasj√∂n, which has a large wetland area on its Northern shore. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2070%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nWe reached H√§ssleholm and had some restorative cake and iced coffee in Espresso House, before we got into our second accomodation, Kronans B\u0026B. The landlady was very friendly and the accomodation charmingly old-fashioned and simple. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2073%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n### Day 3: H√§ssleholm - N√∂sdala\nThe way out of H√§ssleholm led through a nice wetland area which was originally man-made, but had been colonised very well by all kinds of local birds. It was a calm, overcast and slightly frosty early Saturday morning, and we saw different ducks, geese, swans, a cormorant, oyster catchers, a kite and all kinds of other smaller birds. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2080%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nThen we walked up into the forest again, first beech then thick pine and spruce, with the occasional sad-looking clear-cut area. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2084%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nWe had a tea break sitting on soft moss, far away from any road noises. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2087%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nWalking downwards into the little village of Tormastorp, we had hoped for the only food place along this day's trail to be open, Pizzeria Capri. But it was closed. So we walked up the hill into the forest again and ate the last of the savoury muffins we'd brought. The long stretch along the G√∂inge ridge (G√∂inge√•sen) was mostly beech forest again, with large boulders lying hapharzadly around. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2090%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%2091%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nAt around 3 we arrived at our third accomodation, Rallahustruns, a newly opened, very nicely restored small old hostel/hotel in the middle of the forest. We cooked our pre-ordered dinner box (Pasta with tomato sauce, parmesan and artichokes) and slept in the nice soft bed. \n\n\n### Day 4: N√∂sdala - H√∂√∂r\nIt was clearly spring now. We started walking in bright sunshine, clear blue sky, and the temperature noticebly increased during the day to around 12 ¬∫C. At times we only walked in T-shirts and we stopped more frequently to drink water. This part of the trail was also more exposed, leading through small farm areas with alpine character - hard, rocky grassland and hundred-year-old scraggly oaks. At each farm we passed, a barking dog announced our presence to the next farm's dog. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20102%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20103%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nAbout 20 km into the walk, we made the decision to cut the day a bit short and take a train from Tj√∂rnarp to H√∂√∂r instead of walking another 16 km to H√∂√∂r. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20104%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nThis was mostly due to my head hurting a bit, Laika looking a bit exhausted in the warmth and that we wanted to enjoy our next accomodation a bit, which was by far the most expensive on the whole trip - Stift √Ökersberg. Somewhat disappointing though, the room was quite basic, with two single beds and a tiny bathroom without a tub. I washed my hair for the first time on the trip, because at least they had a hair dryer, and then we left Laika in the room and went to \"downtown\" H√∂√∂r to have late lunch. Given the small size of H√∂√∂r, we were quite impressed that we not only found a place with decent Neapolitain-style pizza (Bella Mozarella), but also a British pie shop (The Barking Dog Diner) and a super-cute caf√© (Caf√© Old Fashion).\n\nFull of pizza and loaded up on sweets, we spent the rest of the day chilling in the bed, but went out again for an evening walk to visit Sk√•nes geographical centre point [Sk√•nes Mitt](https://www.hoor.se/uppleva-gora/idrott-motion-och-friluftsliv/friluftsliv-och-motion/motionsslingor-och-naturomraden/halsans-stig/skanes-mitt/). \n\n\n### Day 5: H√∂√∂r - H√∂rby\nAfter a nice buffet breakfast with pancakes, we started on the last leg of the hike on a circuitous route through H√∂√∂r and then out into the forest again. Mostly along wider forest paths, we passed two other hikers! The most we'd seen on the whole trail so far. \n\nTowards Fulltofta Naturreservat, the number of day walkers increased, some having picnics or barbecuing on a public grillplats. No wonder, it was sunny Easter Sunday! Parts of the trail through the nature reserve were on nice wooden walkways through wetlands and along little streams. We also saw several huge anthills. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20115%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Imports%20-%20120%20of%20123.jpeg)\n\nWe had a last stop in the forest to eat the pies that we had purchased the previous day and our final m√ºsli bars. Then we walked towards H√∂rby, and into the town centre.

Three little mountains with a view over the coast and to the Danish island Bornholm. Sandy beaches at the bottom (badplats!). Nice arboreum.\nFairly small and can easily be done in a day. Quite many people around (during summer season). Not really a \"wild\" national park, but still nice to walk through. \n\nWent there in August 2021: [Stenshuvuds nationalpark](trips/Stenshuvuds%20nationalpark.md) \n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nBus to Kivik (via Kristianstad) or bus via Lund and Simrishamn. Then the last few kilometers walking (6 km, e.g. along Sk√•neleden from Kivik to Simrishamn) or taxi.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamp ground at the northern entrance. Hotels and guesthouses in Kivik. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nSk√•neleden goes through. \nVery easy to find hiking trails, well marked. The longest is not even 5 km long. \n\n\n## Dalby S√∂derkogs nationalpark\nSweden's smallest national park. Old southern Swedish leafy forest (oak, beech). Augustiner kloster from 1060s. \n\n#### Good to know\n- Prettiest in spring when vitsippor and gulsippor are covering the ground. \n- The naturrum is in Skrylle naturreservat.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nBus (30 min) from Lund Central to either Dalby S√∂derskog or Skrylle naturum.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nVinskydd in neighbouring Skrylle naturreservat. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nThree walking routes (0.5-3.5 km). One of them - Skryllestigen - then continues on through the naturreservat Dalby Norreskog and further to Skrylle naturreservat, which is actually much bigger than Dalby S√∂derskog. \n\nWent there in March 2023: [Dalby S√∂derskog](trips/Dalby%20S√∂derskog.md)\n\n## S√∂der√•sen nationalpark\nNorth-western Sk√•ne, near Helsingborg. Goes from √Östorp to R√∂st√•nga. Lies exactly between European and Scandinavian continental plates, which formed a ravine and pushed up a small mountain (Kopparhatten, 200 m). \n\nBeech forests, high cliffs, ravines and a little river running through. Good views all around from the top of Kopparhatten. Quite small, but still Northern Europe's biggest protected leafy forest.\n\nWent there in June 2022: [S√∂der√•sen nationalpark](trips/S√∂der√•sen%20nationalpark.md)\n\n#### Good to know\n- Main entrance is in Sk√§ralid, the Southern entrance in R√∂st√•nga. \n- Possible to go up Kopparhatten with the car.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Klippan, then bus to Sk√§ralid or R√∂st√•nga (30 min). \n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamp grounds and vindskydd can be found at Dahlbergs and Liag√•rden. Guesthouses in R√∂st√•nga. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nSk√•neleden goes through the park (from R√∂st√•nga to Sk√§ralid and then further on to Kl√•ver√∂d). Several other trails between 2 and 7 km long starting from both Sk√§ralid or R√∂st√•nga.\n\n\n## √Ösnens nationalpark\nSweden's youngest national park (2018). Like a Sweden in miniature. Forests, lakes, islands. Nice in all seasons, but especially in winter when it's possible to walk on frozen lakes or in the autumn when Sm√•land's mushroom Koralltaggsvampen grows. Many different kinds of trees including 250 year old beech trees.\n\nhttps://visitasnen.se/\n\n#### Good to know\n- Nice to go around by kayak or canoe. \n- Main entrance at Sunnabron, south of V√§xj√∂. Smaller entrance in Trollberget on the western side of the lake.\n- In some areas entrance is prohibited from 1 April to 31 July due to bird protection.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to V√§xj√∂. Then a 44 min bus ride (or 4h30min walking) to Kr√•ketorp gets you to the northern tip of the lake. From there it's 3h walk to the main entrance.\n\nTo enter from the southern side, bus from V√§xj√∂ to Vipan or Torget Ryd are maybe good options. \n\n#### Stay overnight\nOne vindskydd with place for 3-4 tents near Utsikten. Nice-looking B\u0026B places around, e.g. Toftahult B\u0026B.\n\n#### Hiking routes\nSeveral small-ish ones around the three main entrances. Along the west side of the park leads the [cycle route √Ösnen runt](https://www.naturkartan.se/sv/kronobergs-lan/asnen-runt)(140 km, along an old railway line with many nice views of the lake). There's also a 120 km long canoe route called [V√§rendsleden](https://www.naturkartan.se/en/kronobergs-lan/varendsleden?guide_id=64). \n\n\n## Store Mosse nationalpark\nIn the highlands of Sm√•land. Raised bog (largest south of lapland) with 7m thick peat layer. Nature is barren. One of the best bird lakes in Sweden - K√§vsj√∂n. Not unusual to see elks (esp. at dusk or dawn), otters or one of the 19 bat species living here. \n\n#### Good to know\n- Bring water-proof shoes (maybe even wellies).\n- Around K√§vsj√∂n it can be quite many visitors, but usually the southern and eastern parts of the park are emptier. \n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain via H√§ssleholm and Alvesta to V√§rnamo (3.5 hours from Helsingborg). Another 15-20 min bus to get closer to the park, and to get to Hillerstorp.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nSeven camping sites in the park, and two old g√•rds - L√∂v√∂ and Svan√∂ (no electricity or water). \n\n#### Hiking routes\nRoutes of various length, altogether 50 km (about half of them with wooden planks). Cycle route [Hillerstorpareleden](https://vastrasmaland.se/sv/gnosjo/hillerstorpareleden/) goes right through the park from Hillerstorp to V√§rnamo. A 12 km long route leads around K√§vsj√∂n starting at the naturum. A 14 km long route goes from the naturum to the southern end of the park at Andersberg. On this one you can get vildmarksk√§nsla. \n\n\n## Bl√• Jungfruns nationalpark\n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Norra Kvills nationalpark\nVildmark in miniature. Big rocks and 350 year old trees, mostly pines. Not very big park. \n\n#### Good to know\n- A few km south of the park is the Kvills naturreservat that houses Kvilleken - Sweden's biggest and oldest tree (1000 years old). \n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\nTwo hiking routes, one 2.5 km long and one 4 km long. \n\n\n## Gotska Sand√∂ns nationalpark\n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Kosterhavets nationalpark\nFirst marine national park (2009). 400 islands and skerries. \n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nFerries from Str√∂mstad to Nordkoster (35 min) and Sydkoster (45 min). \n\n#### Stay overnight\nTwo hotels on Sydkoster, and many in places in Str√∂mstad. Camping allowed on several spots around the park. \n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Tresticklans nationalpark\nNear Norwegian border. The biggest roadless and undeveloped (obebyggd) forest area in Southern Sweden. Untouched wilderness. Marshland, \n\n#### Good to know\n- 90 bigger and smaller lakes\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain from Gothenburg to Ed (1h17min). Then bus line 764 from N√∂ssemark or Ed goes to R√§vmarken a few times a day (weekdays), but has to be pre-ordered. Takes 26 min.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nAllowed to camp. On the Norwegian side there are a few huts in Bodalsviken. Not allowed to light fires (not even grill). \n\n#### Hiking routes\nFrom eastern entrance: Halleleden (4.5 km) that leads to riksgr√§nsen (and further into Norway) - an old trading route. From the main entrance: Tresticklaleden (8 km). Possible to continue from there along Orh√∂jdsleden (10 km) and further through the Her√•madens naturreservat to Dals-Ed. \n\n\n## Djur√∂ nationalpark\nIslands in Sweden's biggest lake V√§nern.\n\n#### Good to know\n- Mostly only accessible with own boat.\n- The smaller islands are protected bird areas and can't be accessed 1 April - 31 July.\n- No possibility to buy food anywhere on the islands.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nPossible to [order boat](https://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/park/djuro-nationalpark/besoksinformation/hitta-hit/) taxis from various places, e.g. Eken√§s. To get to Eken√§s, train to S√§ffle (1h37min from Gothenburg), then bus 808 (55 min). Or from Otterb√§cken: train to Sk√∂vde (1h from Gothenburg), then bus 1 (51 min) to Otterb√§cken via Mariestad.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamping allowed, but not in bird protection areas. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nOne marked route around the main island.\n\n\n## Tivedens nationalpark\nForests, huge rocks, lakes. Many different animals, e.g. wolves, elks, beavers, deer, hares, foxes.\n\n#### Good to know\n- Terrain is quite hilly, so wear good shoes. \n- Quite challenging hiking routes, so plan more time than you think (e.g. 4.5 km can easily take 3 hours).\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nHard to reach without a car. Best is probably to go to Karlsborg: Train from Gothenburg to Sk√∂vde (1h), then bus 400 (55 min) to Karlsborg. Then taxi (20 min) or walk 4 hours to park entrance. \n\n#### Stay overnight\nAllowed to camp one night at various places. Hostel in Tivdedstorp.\n\n#### Hiking routes\nNine different marked routes. Cycle route LIlla Kungsleden goes through the park. One of the best is Stigmansrundan (4.3 km, 3h). Treh√∂rningsrundan (9.5 km, 5h) goes around the lake and passes all three entrances to the park. \n","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.721530431Z","tags":null},"/trips/nationalparks_norrland":{"title":"National parks in Norrland","content":"\n## Abisko nationalpark - norra delen\n- Abisko nationalpark - s√∂dra delen\n- Bj√∂rnlandets nationalpark\n\n## F√§rnebofj√§rdens nationalpark\nNear Dala river, wetland, old forests, unusually rich birdlife (\u003e200 species). Meeting point of Southern and Northern Swedish flora and fauna (leafy trees vs. Taiga conifers). Vildmarkskarakt√§r. Ofta √∂versw√§mmat. L√∂vskogar. \n\n#### Good to know\n- **May** is the best month to visit. Nature awakes after winter and birds arrive, mosquitoes still rare. \n- Good to explore by foot, but best is via the water (canoe, kayak). \n- Several times votes as Sweden's best tourist destination.\n- It's allowed to pick berries and mushrooms (for own use).\n- A lot of mosquitoes during the summer.\n- Least visited part is near Tin√§set in the Southern part. \n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Stockholm, then G√§vle. Bus 49 to **Gysinge** (=main entrance to national park), takes 1h.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nVarious vandrarhem, v√§rdshus and B\u0026B in **Gysinge**. Also vindskydd and √∂ppna stugor that allow staying overnight for up to 2 nights.\n\n#### Hiking routes\n1 km and 4 km short routes (start at Naturum). 9 km route along Kyrkstigen from T√§rnsj√∂ to Skekarsbo (partially outside of national park borders). For a long hike (30 km), start at Gysinge and combine different trails: go to Skekarsbo, follow Kyrkstigen to T√§rnsj√∂, then proceed along Ljusb√§cksleden to √ñsta naturreservat. \n\n## Hamra nationalpark\n\n## Haparanda sk√§rg√•rds nationalpark\n\n## Muddus-Muttos nationalpark - norra delen\n\n## Muddus-Muttos nationalpark - s√∂dra delen\n\n## Padjelanta/Badjel√°nnda nationalpark\n\n## Pieljekaise nationalpark\n\n## Sareks nationalpark\n\n## Skuleskogens nationalpark\n\n## Sonfj√§llets nationalpark\n\n## Stora Sj√∂fallet-Stuor Muorkke nationalpark\n\n## Vadvetj√•kka nationalpark","lastmodified":"2024-06-01T20:36:10.721530431Z","tags":null}}
