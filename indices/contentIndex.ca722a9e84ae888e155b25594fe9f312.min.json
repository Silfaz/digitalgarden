THAT'S INSANE!! There's also now a thing called **\"hallucinating protein sequences\"**, which sounds like straight out of a sci-fi novel.

I never understand how these two are mutually exclusive, and why people argue about what is more important. **They are both equally important and don't work without the other!** \n\nPersonal action is often regarded as having too little or even no impact. But that argument seems to be a way for people to absolving themselves from responsibility and power. Often grounded in envy, greed and self-defence - _Why should __I__ stop flying when there are billionaires flying to space? Why should __I__ feel bad about eating meat when this guy over there is eating double my portion?_  - things that are (unfortunatley) deeply human. And I can totally understand it, because I'm not immune to these thoughts either. It's not nice to on one hand become aware of your bad impact on the environment, feel like you want to change it, feel guilty about things that you can't or don't want to change, and then see others not care while you try to make an effort. \n\nThe way out of this (at least for me) is to reframe these personal actions as something positive. Not consuming so much has had a very calming effect on life in general (is shopping really fun??). It's cheaper, and not accumulating so many things is quite relieving. Eating vegan and vegetarian has improved my cooking, made me more curious about ingredients and other cuisines, and it's (usually) healthier. Not owning a car is another huge reliever of the stress that road rage, parking problems, traffic jams, accidents, repairs etc. would cause, and saves me quite a lot of money. I LOVE my calm train commute where I can read a book or look out the window.  \n\nAnd as an argument for people still insisting that personal action won't change a thing: Industries have forever figured out that tiny actions have a HUGE impact! The famous example of airlines reducing the number or even the [weight of paper](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-travel-briefcase-united-inflight-magazine-20180120-story.html) of in-flight magazines cuts litterally _millions_ of liters of fuel every year. I work in a big food company - just reducing some heating process by _one degree_ in the factory has an enormous impact on total energy consumption (and costs) as well as some knock-on effects like less wear on heat exchangers (i.e. cost savings), less need for harsh cleaning materials (i.e. positive for the environment), etc. It's so short-sighted to think that none of us individuals has an impact. \n\n----\n\nHere's another article that argues that personal action doesn't have much impact and that people shouldn't be too preachy about it: https://medianism.org/2022/08/15/you-cant-get-no-satisfaction-from-reducing-your-own-personal-carbon-footprint/\n\nI do agree with the premise: \n\u003eBeing self-righteous about your own personal actions against climate change can make other people feel inferior and cause them to reject the entire idea. \n\n\u003eOur most important job as environmentalists is to convince the people who haven't yet been convinced that we should do anything at all.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that working on reducing your own personal footprint is pointless. Sure, it's much more important to work on collective reduction in carbon emissions than to fret about a piece of cheese you ate or a pair of trousers you bought, but who if not WE AS CONSUMERS should stop consuming? Fewer things being needlessly produced, fewer things being shipped around the planet, fewer things ending up in landfills and oceans. \nIt's always presented as such a sacrifice, but I think many people (in rich countries) could live an equally happy, if not happier, life if their focus wasn't so much on accumulating things and spending money on status symbols. \n\nThe more interesting point in this article is:\n\u003e There is an asymmetry between the efforts of climate-change environmentalists versus big carbon. Environmentalists spend a lot of our moral resources to increase our personal moral purity and reduce our individual carbon footprint. On the other side of the political divide, big carbon doesn’t waste any resources on personal moral purity and so they can devote all their resources to influence the public sphere to stop policies that would actually make a difference.\n\nNot so much the thing about personal moral purity etc. (the article spends far too much space painting environmentalists as these ultra-preachy people who feel superior). But the idea that industries (oil, plastic, sugar, cigarettes, cars, etc.) encourage putting the onus on individual people as a distraction, while spending their time and power on influencing policies and politics.\n\nIt's not a strategy that environmentalists should or could adopt - Big Oil makes a LOT of money and has interest in making even more, on the other hand environmentalists are not driven by profit and can't (and shouldn't) offer the same incentives to (corrupt) politicians as oil lobbyists do. But it's important to identify these strategies and **call companies out** on them. Investigate, reveal, explain, publicize. \n\nOverall, I agree that if you want to have maximum positive effect on the climate, it's much better to **look for actions with the most impact**, participate in organisations and events, be vocal about climate change and be inclusive and not alienating about it, than to _just_ reduce your own personal carbon footprint. \nBut again, how is anything supposed to change if no one is making ANY change? Many drops make an ocean. We need both - personal action and collective action. One doesn't work without the other, it's a chicken and egg problem. \n\n---\n\n## Actions\n- Find impactful and public climate actions (including: donate to and support the actions that have the most impact). \n- Be vocal about participating in (fun) climate actions.\n- Show the upsides of leading a low-carbon life style. It's not a sacrifice: not owning a car is freedom; train travel is fun, cheap and fast; repairing clothes is often more rewarding than buying  new ones; vegan food is delicious and healthy; hobbies don't have to cost money or be based on consumption.\n- Expose industries for their distracting actions as well as their damaging actions (car companies producing ever bigger cars and marketing them as FREEDOM; companies implementing distracting \"skip the straw\" initatives [while collaborating with oil industry](https://logicmag.io/nature/oil-is-the-new-data/), etc.).\n\n---\n## What makes people care\n(from [The Science of What Makes People Care](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_science_of_what_makes_people_care#))\n\u003eResearch from multiple disciplines tells us that people engage and consume information that affirms their identities and aligns with their deeply held values and worldview, and avoid or reject information that challenges or threatens them.\n\nAnd very importantly: \n\u003e People seek information that **makes them feel good about themselves and allows them to be a better version of themselves**. If you start with this understanding of the human mind and behavior, you can design campaigns that help people see where your values intersect and how the issues you are working on matter to them.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221022204336.png)\n\n\n\u003ePeople tend to avoid or remain unmoved by stories and situations that attempt to make them feel bad. They avoid information that makes them feel sad, fearful, or guilty when there isn’t a way to resolve those feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, very powerful emotions are **awe** (e.g. at the beauty of nature) and **pride** (e.g. about helping the environment). \n\n\nEffective calls to action follow three rules: \n- They are specific\n- The target community sees how the solution will help solve the problem\n- And they are something the community knows how to do.\n\n\n\u003eCalls to action that leave people feeling that they will not make a difference on the issue will likely result in inaction.\n\n\n\u003ePeople fail to act not because they do not have enough information, but because they don’t care or they don’t know what to do. If you start with this perspective as the foundation for your work, you can craft a strategy that helps people care and tells them exactly what you want them to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:33.827064168Z","tags":null},"/climate/climate_main":{"title":"Environment \u0026 climate action","content":"\nThoughts on [personal action](climate/Personal%20action.md)\n\n\n\n## Reading list\n[How we will fight climate change](climate/How%20we%20will%20fight%20climate%20change.md)\n\n[Oil is the new data](climate/Oil%20is%20the%20new%20data.md)\n\n[[How to blow up a pipeline]]\n\n[Stop raising awareness already](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/stop_raising_awareness_already)\n\u003e(...) labeling certain fish as ecofriendly had little effect on most consumers.

The sun trickles through the dense canopy of tall trees above you. You’re surrounded by plants and animals - birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking, leaves rustling, insects crawling. But there is another inhabitant in the forest, neither plant nor animal. It permeates the soft and bouncy soil under your feet with long, thin filaments, entangled and growing in all directions, decomposing dead wood into nutrients, nurturing tree roots. Here and there you can see a trace of this inhabitant, in the form of a shiny hat atop a delicate stem, a thick white wedge growing from the side of a tree trunk, or a velvet blanket covering a decaying fruit. Welcome to the world of fungi.\n\n---\n\nFungi are a vital part of our ecosystems, often called the “recyclers of Nature”. But what exactly are these enigmatic lifeforms? They contribute to our lives in a myriad of ways, synthesizing antibiotics, acids and cholesterol medication, producing food and drinks, growing into furniture, insulation and clothes, cleaning water and decontaminating soil… Just like they permeate the forest floor, they permeate society, but still many people know very little about them. Most just view the creeping growth of mould as repulsive and disgusting, a sign of spoilage (though if watched closely, [a quite beautiful one](https://vimeo.com/454729694?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-1-fungi)).\n\nIn this newsletter, I want to offer a different perspective. I’ll tell you stories where the fungi are the heroes. Fungi are a true cornerstone of our civilization, they deserve a place in the spotlight. 10 carefully selected topics will highlight the surprising and exciting ways in which fungi and fungal technology have changed, are changing, and will change our world.\n\n![Pleurotus mycelium on coffee grounds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Mycelium_RH_%288%29.jpg)\n\n### So what are fungi?\n\n\u003e “Fungi are diverse and often flexible, and they live in many places, ranging from ocean currents to toenails.” [1]\n\nFungi are neither bacteria, nor plant nor animal. But they share characteristics with all of these kingdoms, stretching conventional classification systems in a lot of ways.\n\nLike bacteria, they can be classed as microorganisms—and some fungi do exist as microscopic single cells (yeasts). Most, however, exist as multicellular organisms—assembling into branching structures that cover centimetres or even metres in diameter.\n\nLike plants, fungi can form different tissues and organs, and produce seed-like spores to spread. But unlike trees and flowers and algae, fungi don’t rely on sunlight to grow, and their cell walls don’t contain cellulose. Even so, until the middle of the 20th century, fungi were considered to be part of the plant kingdom and it was only after genetic analyses that we were able to determine for certain that they are actually related more closely to animals than to plants.\n\nLike animals, fungi constantly need to find organic material to consume to stay alive. Animals usually do this by digesting food inside their bodies while fungi secrete digestive enzymes outside their bodies, directly onto their food, to break it down and then absorb this soup of nutrients. Animals usually move around, while fungi instead reach and grow in different directions (usually towards a food source).\n\nMost fungi I will write about grow into vast networks (these are called “filamentous fungi”, or moulds), but I will occasionally mention and even dedicate a whole chapter to fungi that stay as single cells throughout their lives: the yeasts. Similarly, mushrooms will be mentioned at times, but there is a difference between fungi and mushrooms. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of some fungi, but not all fungi form mushrooms.\n\n\u003e “A mushroom is not a self-contained organism, like a jellyfish, for example. It is a reproductive organ produced by a colony, or mycelium, which grows in soil or rotting wood. For convenience, we use the term ‘mushroom’ rather than ‘mushroom-forming fungus’ to describe the whole organism, although this is a bit like using a photograph of a large pair of testicles to represent an elephant.” [2]\n\n![Oyster mushrooms](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/15/18/10/fungi-2069474_1280.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### Growing in networks\n\nThe life of a filamentous fungus starts with a tiny spore, just a few micrometers in size, falling onto humid soil or a juicy fruit lying on the ground. The spore germinates and grows into a network of fine thread-like filaments (hyphae) that spread out and form the mycelium, a network of cells working together for survival, growing through organic matter, soil, wood and decaying leaves. Individual hyphae can only be seen under the microscope, but the mycelium as a whole grows into a large fluffy mass that is visible to the naked eye (like on that orange you forgot in the fruit basket).\n\nNutrients direct this growth, with the filaments acting as fine probing sensors that test the surrounding space and grow in whichever direction the conditions are more favourable. As they grow, the far tips of the filaments secrete enzymes into their environment that break down organic material into simple sugars, which are then taken up by the fungal cells and shared among the whole mycelium network.\n\n\u003e “If you could make the soil liquid and transparent and walk into the ground, you would find yourself surrounded by the nets of fungal hyphae.” [1]\n\n![Mycelium growth simulation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Mycelium_growth_simulation.gif)\n\n---\n\nThat’s as much fungal biology as you need to know for now, but it is important to set the scene for the three characteristics that are most important for understanding how humans use fungi:\n\n-   the growth into a dense network\n-   the ability to produce enzymes and other substances and release them into their surroundings\n-   and the ability to grow on a wide range of different things, many of which we consider waste.\n\nFungi are found almost everywhere on Earth - in soil, water, air, and on and inside other organisms. Recent estimates suggest that there are up to 3.8 million different species of fungi, of which only 120 000 have been formally recognised, and only 35 000 named [3]. This means 97% of fungi are still waiting to be found, and most of those are in tropical parts of the world where species diversity is higher.\n\nThere are already a dizzying variety of fungi and mushrooms that have proven or supposed medicinal effects, can be eaten or are used for industrial processes. Imagine how many there are yet to be found. So let’s get to it.\n\n_In the next episode:_ **_Turning starch into protein. Eating mould. The history of Quorn.

Credit: Silvia Hüttner._\n\nBeer, cheese, bread, soy sauce… All of the intentional uses of fungi in food production once started as accidental discoveries, with spores delivered by wind, hands, grains and fruits. These discoveries happened centuries, or even millennia, ago. But there is one recent example where the use of a fungus to produce a new food product was actually the result of rational planning and careful screening of suitable strains. This lab-based approach resulted in what was called by its inventor “the first new food since the potato”.\n\n## Turning starch into protein\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, many scientists as well as UN agencies warned that the world would soon run out of protein. Fears that animal products alone could not feed Earth’s growing population, and would cause famines and malnourishment, spurred research into alternative sources. It wasn’t long before food scientists started to turn to microorganisms for nutrition. Fungi and bacteria have the advantage of growing very efficiently under simple conditions. Most of them need just sugar, nitrogen, phosphorus and some minerals to grow and grow and grow and grow, doubling in number in as little as half an hour. Inside their cells they turn the nutrients they’ve taken up into edible protein, much more efficiently than any cow or chicken could ever do. This seemed like a perfect way to produce protein at a large scale.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3osxYeymtCD76SeQjC/giphy.gif)\n\n_Animation of bacteria growing and dividing. Credit: Giphy_\n\nAs a large cereal producer, British food conglomerate Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) had a lot of starch left over and started looking into ways to turn this abundant carbohydrate-rich byproduct into more sought-after protein. They collected over 3000 samples of filamentous fungi from all over the world to identify a strain that was safe to eat, would have a pleasant flavour and texture, and grew well on starch or sugar under laboratory and industrial conditions. The almost-too-good-to-be true story is, that despite combing the entire planet, the researchers eventually struck gold in 1967 in a field just a stone’s throw away from the RHM Technology Research Centre in Buckinghamshire, UK. The soil fungus they found, _Fusarium venenatum_, subsequently became the now hundred-million-dollar brand Quorn.\n\nTurning a soil fungus into a new food product took Quorn many years of research, feeding trials in 12 animal species, and food safety assessments that included a two million word report on toxicology to get approval from the authorities. It also took time and money to develop and optimise the necessary large-scale production equipment to grow the fungus and turn it into food. But in 1985, this work was finally complete and Quorn launched on British supermarket shelves bearing the name “mycoprotein” (from myco = Greek for fungus) in the form of mince, “chicken” filets, sausages, and more. In the 35 years since, Quorn has gradually expanded into other countries. Occasionally, the brand faced some resistance on introduction, such as in the US where they were accused of [mislabelling](https://www.wired.com/2002/04/a-mushrooming-quorn-controversy/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) the products as “mushroom-based” (they now mention “mould” on their labels, as well as possible cross-reactions from people allergic to mould). Today Quorn is available in 14 countries worldwide.\n\n![](https://images.ctfassets.net/uexfe9h31g3m/38d4Fi2mtGKqsIA28YKGow/a136af0e6910ef10caf82a7d2d931096/Quorn_Thai_Sticky_Fillets.jpg?w=1024\u0026h=576\u0026fm=webp\u0026fit=thumb\u0026q=90)  \n_“Chicken” filet from Quorn UK’s recipe website. Credit: Quorn_\n\n---\n\n## How is mycoprotein made?\n\nMycoprotein, like Quorn, is made in large, up to 40-metre tall, stainless steel tanks (called bioreactors) that keep a mixture of sugar, water and some minerals at a certain temperature. Air is bubbled through the liquid, mixing it and saturating it with oxygen. Into this nutrient jacuzzi, a small volume of fungi starter culture is added, in a sterile way to make sure that nothing else but the specific fungal strain grows inside the tank. The fungal cells, surrounded by the most ideal conditions they could hope for, happily start to grow and divide, soon forming thick, fluffy clumps of mycelium that have a consistency somewhere between applesauce and wet cotton. If no more nutrients are added, the mycelium grows until all available sugar in the liquid is consumed and the whole process is completed in less than 24h.\n\nThe mycelium, aka the mycoprotein, can then be harvested by separating it from the liquid. The doughy mass of beige mycoprotein coming out of the bioreactor is surprisingly meat-like, since the fine, intertwined filaments of the mycelium resemble muscle fibres and give the product a chewy texture. Mycoprotein is high in protein and fibre content, and very low in fat and sugar. And what does it taste like? If you expect an aromatic mushroom-like taste you might be disappointed to learn that it doesn’t really taste of anything much. On the other hand, if you’re a food company looking for an easy meat replacement, you’re probably thrilled by this fact.\n\nQuorn runs a continuous process, where grown mycelium is removed from the tank and fresh sugar-water is added at all times, keeping a steady stream of nutrients and space for new mycelium to grow [1]. In this way, a single process can run for up to six weeks churning out hundreds of kilos of mycoprotein per hour. Compare that to the time it takes for a cow to grow from conception to slaughterhouse, and it’s clear to see why mycoprotein production is such an incredibly efficient way to produce protein.\n\n_Side note: This way of growing microorganisms is either referred to as cultivation or fermentation. In a biochemistry-strict sense, fermentation only happens in the absence of oxygen, though the term has become somewhat looser in food production._\n\n---\n\n## Finnish mycoprotein\n\nAround the same time that Quorn was created in the UK, and prompted by the same motivations to increase worldwide protein production, a similar process was developed further North, with a very different outcome.\n\nFinland’s forest cover is more extensive than that of any other European country, about 76% of the land is covered with trees. Naturally, pulp and paper production has been a very important industry for centuries, and the pulp mills dotting the landscape churn out not only paper but also large amounts of waste streams containing water, acids, other chemicals, and cellulose. As you can witness in a forest, many fungi can grow on wood and consume the sugars in the wood cellulose as food. Therefore, researchers in the 1960s looked into the possibility of using the cellulose-containing waste streams in paper mills as a nutrient source for growing fungi. Hundreds of strains were tested and one was identified as suitable to grow on these waste streams and produce high amounts of protein-rich mycelium.\n\nThe process was named Pekilo process, after the fungus they used, _Paecilomyces variotii_, and industrial production at two sites in Finland was established. Thousands of tonnes of mycoprotein were produced to be used initially as pig and chicken feed. Researchers also looked into using Pekilo as an ingredient in sausages, meatballs [2] and bread [3]. However, after only a decade, production of Pekilo protein was stopped and it never made it onto supermarket shelves. Why? New developments in the paper pulping process had led to changes in the waste stream composition, and at the same time interest in Pekilo protein decreased. The last Pekilo plant in Mänttä closed in 1992.\n\n---\n\n## Quorn’s competitors\n\nBy the 1980s, fears of the “World Protein Gap” had faded and been [debunked](https://theconversation.com/the-protein-gap-nutritional-sciences-biggest-error-76202?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds). In the 90s, Pekilo research was put into a filing cupboard, and Quorn - though successful - remained a niche product for vegetarians for most of the late 20th and early 21st century. All the while humanity continued to [increase its taste for animal protein](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) and found ever more ways to erode ecosystems and animal welfare through factory farming and feed plantations.\n\nIn recent years, however, due to greater awareness of the negative impact of meat production on the environment and meat consumption on personal health, sales of plant-based alternatives have grown enormously. Virtually every large food producer has soy, pea or gluten protein products on the market today. But when it comes to mycoprotein, Quorn is still the only option on supermarket shelves.\n\nThere are several possible reasons why other companies are still hesitant to make food from mycelium. The first is lack of expertise, as fungi cultivation and mycoprotein production require a very specific set of skills not traditionally found in the food industry. Another is concern that the association with mould could be a turn-off for consumers. There can also be considerable regulatory hurdles when it comes to using new ingredients in food - remember, it took Quorn a long time and a lot of money to get their mycoprotein approved. Finally, there’s the simple calculation that investing in very expensive and specialised equipment may just not be worth it when new alternative-meat products created with known ingredients (soy etc.) are performing so well.\n\nThings are beginning to change, however. The need for greener food production is more pressing than ever, consumers are starting to crave new products (and are often willing to pay a higher price for them), and the boom in microbreweries has shown that it’s feasible to start successful fermentation businesses even if you’re not a multinational corporation. Not unimportantly as well, many of Quorn’s initial patents recently expired, making it possible to “copy” their process, and you can even order the Quorn strain [from a culture collection](https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/products/all/20334?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds).\n\nSeveral small companies have popped up in the last couple of years that promise an updated, 21st-century version of how mycoprotein can help feed (and save) the world. They mostly focus on the prospective immense savings of water, land area, time and greenhouse gas emissions that can be achieved when comparing the production of a kilo of mycoprotein to a kilo of meat, as well as the advantages of mycoprotein over plant-based alternatives. Mycoprotein has a better [nutritional profile](https://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Fulltext/2019/01000/Mycoprotein__Nutritional_and_Health_Properties.4.aspx?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) than many plant proteins, offers a better (meaning in this case more meat-like) texture and can be grown faster on less land than most plants.\n\nTo differentiate themselves from Quorn, these companies innovate on different aspects of the production process.

Tanks for mycoprotein production can be made in any size, and with some clever engineering, personal myco-fermenters could soon be a [normal appliance](https://www.kernel.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) in our homes. Or, if not in our homes, then a decentralised food production system could be envisioned, where villages or communities might manufacture their own mycoprotein. Similarly, mycoprotein production could happen at many different sites in connection with other industries that produce suitable side-streams which are then directly fed into the fungi cultivation tanks, as pioneered by the Pekilo process.\n\nSince the fungal growth process happens in a controlled, sealed-off environment, this type of food production is largely independent of weather, climate or soil conditions and can therefore happen in places where normal agriculture is impossible (and increasingly more impossible due to climate change). Of course, the need for clean water and electricity for the fermentation present a challenge, but one that will hopefully be solved in the near future by improved production processes (e.g. water recycling) and [better availability of solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) and wind power. Currently, the carbon footprint of mycoprotein is still slightly worse than that of plant proteins or even chicken [4], mostly because of the high electricity demand of heating, cooling, stirring and aerating the bioreactors. And while chicken farming is certainly not great for chickens, its greenhouse gas emissions are actually relatively low compared to other meats (such as beef). But mycoprotein production is already a clear winner in some aspects, such as water pollution (no manure runoff into waterways!) or land use.\n\nWhat about lab-grown meat? In the last few years it has attracted a lot of attention and investment and has, like mycoprotein, been touted as a “game changer” for more sustainable food production. Unfortunately, the animal cells that are used for lab-grown meat are more delicate and fussy than fungi cells, grow slower and require more complicated bioreactor setups and conditions (e.g. scaffolds, vitamins, growth factors). Lab-grown meat has still not been produced at large scale, while mycoprotein is actually a comparatively [mature technology](http://fafdl.org/blog/2019/08/01/why-cultured-meat-will-not-feed-the-world-but-mycoprotein-just-might/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds). At the time of writing, it’s [questionable](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03448-1?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) if lab-grown meat will ever live up to its promises of being a more sustainable meat alternative [5].\n\nEither way, for some people, growing our food in temperature-controlled tanks might be a step too futuristic or “unnatural”. But if it means drastically reducing the environmental impact, not slaughtering billions of animals on a daily basis and being able to produce tasty and nutritious food in a reliable manner, it’s perhaps worth revisiting those reservations.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode: **Fungi as materials.

Also called tinder mushroom, it was also a popular flammable substance and even [Ötzi the Iceman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) had some of it in his pockets when he was crossing the Alps.\n\nAmadou was for a long time the only fungi-based material in common use, but this is about to change. In the last ten years, materials made with or from fungi have started to pop up in design and art magazines, as chairs, lampshades or wallets or even as whole buildings. So far mostly used as concept pieces or promotional material from design studies, fungi products might finally go mainstream in 2021. The New York Times [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) about fungi being _“fall’s hottest fashion trend”_ and Adidas very recently [announced](https://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2020/adidas-2021-first-time-more-60-percent-all-products-will-be-made/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) the development of “a new material, a purely biological leather alternative made from mycelium” that they will use “for the very first time in the creation of footwear”. It’s not that often that people get excited about fungi on their feet.\n\nSo let’s look into what kind of fungi materials there are, how to make them, and why they’re exciting. We’ll start with leather.\n\n## Mycelium leather\n\n\u003e “There are traditionally two ways to make a leather jacket. One involves a cow, and takes years. Another involves synthetic fabric, and requires plastic. But there’s a third option: thick sheets of woven fungus, grown over a couple of weeks on anything from sawdust to agricultural waste.” ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/science/fungus-leather.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nRemember how mycoprotein is made in big vats for food, as described in [Episode 2](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)? You can make fungal leather in much the same way - where the fibrous mycelium pulp is pressed into sheets like paper pulp in traditional paper-making.\n\nMore commonly though, fungal leather is obtained by solid state fermentation, meaning that the mycelium grows in mats on a bed of nutritious solid particles, often agricultural waste, such as straw or sawdust. This is less energy-intensive than liquid cultivation, and also allows the mycelium to grow in its naturally self-assembling, three-dimensional structure, which is important for the texture and durability of the resulting material.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0YiVsb.jpg) _Pressed and dried mycelium mats (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\nSome species are more suitable than others [1]. The fungi used for this process are usually of the mushroom-forming variety (basidiomycetes), therefore the growth conditions have to be adjusted carefully to suppress mushroom formation and get only the desired dense mats of mycelium. Indonesia-based Mycotech - who launched [fungi sneakers and wallets](https://www.store.mycl.bio/product-page/bro-do-x-mylea-better-shoes?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in 2019 - experimented first with the common oyster mushroom, before [switching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykWIACD6u8E\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) to Ganoderma (also called Lingzhi or Reishi) because it gave better results. Generally, [polypores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) - which you can often find on the side of tree trunks - are used for creating fungi materials, because they grow in a denser structure than other fungal species.\n\nAfter 5-10 days of growth, the mat of interwoven mycelium is harvested, pressed and dried to obtain a material that is already surprisingly leather-like. It doesn’t need a full-on tanning process like animal leather, though some chemical treatment is necessary to make it more resilient and improve its properties. Soaking in glycerol increases elasticity and strength [2] and immersing in acid or alcohol removes undesired soluble components and results in crosslinking, which gives the material additional strength and durability. Bleaching or treatment to eliminate odour might also be necessary. After that, the fungal material is pressed and dried, and dyed or imprinted if desired. The result is a material with a nice organic texture, velvety and soft to the touch, a bit like stroking a dry camembert.\n\nDespite not being a completely chemical-free process, production of fungal leather has a much lower environmental impact than animal leather or conventional synthetic leather, which is [made from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_leather?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#Environmental_impact) petroleum-based PVC. A big advantage is also that the mycelium mats can be grown to sizes of several square metres and to many desired shapes or thicknesses.\n\nBeing a biological growth process, no direct energy input is needed (if grown in solid state fermentation and at ambient temperature). And since the species of fungi used are wood degraders, the growth substrates are typically waste or by-products from forestry and agriculture, or even paper and cardboard, which makes the production process in essence an upcycling process.\n\nConsiderable energy input is however necessary not only for the steps after growth (such as pressing and drying), but also for sterilising the raw materials _before_ the fungi can grow on them. This is usually done with heat and steam, but there are less energy-intensive alternatives such as submerging the raw material in peroxide solution for an hour, or in cold water for a few days.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly for a new technology, cost estimates show that mycelium leather is cheaper to produce than comparable animal or synthetic leather varieties [3], since the raw materials cost next to nothing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e1INe92.jpeg) _Mycelium leather samples (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\nSo what are the difficulties in making fungi leather? In an environment where the raw material is literally agricultural waste teeming with thousands of organisms, contamination is one of the biggest issues manufacturers are facing. Even with rigorous sterilisation and cleaning procedures, it’s tricky to avoid other microbes growing alongside the desired fungus, possibly resulting in a damaged product or no product at all.\n\nAnother issue is inconsistency. Biological processes can be finicky, and fungal growth is no exception. Changes in temperature, humidity, substrate composition, time of day, light, CO2 concentration, etc. lead to variations in growth, resulting in products with inconsistent thickness, texture, colour or structure. And customers tend to like consistency.\n\nFungal leather hasn’t been on the market very long yet, so longer-term durability is still unknown. And one of the biggest selling points of fungal leather is also up for discussion: its biodegradability. While pure mycelium can be completely biologically degraded within weeks, polymer composites or coated mycelium materials might not be (and take as long to decompose as the least-biodegradable component in the mix). If fungal leather is mixed too much with other materials, we might end up with the same problem that coated paper and bioplastics face, which is that they are hard or impossible to recycle properly once they reach the end of their life or use.\n\nMycowork’s Reishi (which was presented at [NY fashion week](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/reishi-launch-at-new-york-fashion-week?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in February 2020), for example, incorporates polyester as reinforcement and has a polylactic acid coating, which gives it [higher tear strength and higher flexibility](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/performance-results-q120?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) than even animal leather, but also makes the material hardly biodegradable.\n\n\u003e “In theory, we can grow Reishi in any shape, whether that’s something very large and seamless, or smaller custom shapes that eliminate all the waste associated with cutting a hide. With leather, you’re essentially cutting arbitrary patterns into a cow-shaped hide and so a lot of our brand partners are excited by the fact that Reishi can be grown in any shape–both for the design possibilities that creates and the reduction of waste.” (Matt Scullin, Mycoworks CEO, [Source](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/what-a-fashion-insider-wants-to-know-about-reishi?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nMycoworks was founded in 2013 by Sophia Wang and Philip Ross, an artist that has been working with mycelium since the 1990s. The other prominent player in the field is Ecovative, a mycelium materials pioneer that was founded in New York in 2007. Ecovative partnered with Bolt Threads - a biomaterials company also making artificial spider silk by yeast fermentation - to bring the product Mylo to the market (though [not without legal problems](https://dailygazette.com/2019/03/31/green-island-mushroom-tech-firm-exchanges-legal-salvos-with-california-partner/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) along the way). Mylo [debuted](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boltprojects/the-mylo-driver-bag?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in April 2018, and partnerships with Adidas, Lululemon and Stella McCartney promise fungi-based garments in stores in [2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials).\n\nThere are still only a handful of companies developing fungi leather, and most of them have very similar ideas about naming their product: Mylo (Bolt Threads), Mylea (Mycotech), Mylium ([Mylium](https://www.mylium.nl/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)), [MycoFlex](https://ecovativedesign.com/mycoflex?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) (Ecovative), [Pura Flex](http://pura.mogu.bio/project/pural-materials/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) (MOGU), and Reishi (Mycoworks).\n\nGetting your hands on some fungi lederhosen will still take some time though, as most of these companies don’t yet have large scale production. Instead they’re looking for funding (some [through](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boltprojects/the-mylo-driver-bag?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mycotech/the-worlds-first-mushroom-wooden-watch?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)) or have entered exploratory collaborations with designers (as mentioned above).\n\nBut things could change quickly, especially if existing mushroom farms are adapted to become the leather producers of the near future. Already Mylo [is being grown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in European warehouses that used to produce mushrooms for the gourmet market.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VvinLLO.jpg) _Fungal mycelium growing in stacked trays (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\n---\n\n## Mycelium blocks\n\nLeather is the most fashionable, but certainly not the only material that can be made out of mycelium. Fill some sawdust into a container, add the right kind of fungi spores, wait a few days, and you get a compact block of a natural mycelium composite that is dense, light and surprisingly strong. The mycelium acts like a glue binding the particles together (while also partially digesting them). After baking and killing the living fungi, the material is dry and durable.\n\n![](https://indiebio.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mushroom_brick_mycoworks.jpg) _Mycelium bricks stacked on top of each other (Credit: Mycoworks)_\n\nIf “blocks of light, dense material” remind you of polystyrene, you’re not alone. Several companies have explored the possibilities of making fungi-based packaging to cushion expensive wine bottles or computer parts. Ecovative (with the brand [Mushroom Packaging](https://mushroompackaging.com?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)) licenses its technology of how to grow mycelium in moulds to get the exact right shape and size to snugly hold a product in place. Companies in [New Zealand](https://www.biofab.co.nz/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), the [Netherlands](https://www.grown.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), the [USA](https://www.paradisepackaging.co/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and the [UK](https://www.magicalmushroom.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) use Ecovative’s technology to offer custom-made packaging solutions, including one made of hemp and mycelium that Lush uses to [ship soap](https://www.magicalmushroom.com/casestudies/lush?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials).\n\nHowever, packaging is literally made to be thrown away once you’ve removed the actual product, and so it needs to be a very low-cost product. It’s hard to imagine mycelium foam to be more than a gimmick for high-priced products, since there is already a cheap, widely used, environmentally-friendly solution widely available: paper and cardboard.\n\nOn the other hand, however, fungi-based packaging can be directly made at the farms that produce the primary raw materials, and could offer a more local and low-emission packaging solution that doesn’t require cutting down trees [4]. If that’s enough to compete with existing materials, or if fungi packaging will remain an ultra-niche product, remains to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, fungi’s unique ability to fill and grow into any shape can be used to make more than just throw-away packaging. Italian-based MOGU uses agricultural residues to develop fungi [floor tiles](https://mogu.bio/flooring/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and [acoustic panels](https://mogu.bio/acoustic/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), while Ecovative has made [lampshades](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/lamp-made-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and other interior products from mycelium, and has (together with Ford) explored the use of fungi foams in car doors and car seats. Conveniently, mycelium composites have been found to absorb noise very well, especially the range of car noise (1,000 Hz) and are more fire-resistant and release less smoke than plastic alternatives [5].\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iv54NkeBYrrpMy4eB6aCor8JAGw=/0x0:5616x3744/1820x1213/filters:focal(2359x1423:3257x2321):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55655605/GrowLamp_HangingPendants5.0.jpg) _Lampshades made out of mycelium (Credit: Ecovative)_\n\nFungi can even be used to construct buildings. The construction sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and materials that can be regenerated offer a path to reduce those emissions. Dr. Jan Wurm, director of the international architecture and construction firm Arup, [says](https://mashable.com/video/mycelium-construction-biofabrication-mogu-arup/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) that “we need to use materials that are grown, that are biofabricated”.\n\nFungi to the rescue! Mycelium blocks can be used as cheap and fire-resistant construction and insulation material. Not only are [these materials](https://criticalconcrete.com/building-with-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) biodegradable, but they can also trap more heat than fiberglass insulation, are fireproof, nontoxic, and stronger than concrete relative to its weight [6].\n\nThere are some downsides, of course. Low water resistance can be a problem in construction use, making the material vulnerable to humidity and - ironically - mould. Mycelium material in stable conditions has a lifespan of decades, but when in contact with wet ground it can [start decomposing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q5i9poYc3w\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in a matter of weeks. In that sense, mycelium behaves like untreated softwood. Like wood, the mycelium bricks can be treated with coatings that make them more resilient but might compromise the 100% biodegradability factor. It’s a thorny problem to solve.\n\n\u003e “The future of materials is going to be grown – biofabricated – and mycelium and its extraordinary ability to assemble itself into complex structures is what will enable us to take biofabrication to the next level of performance.” (Eben Bayer, Ecovative CEO, [Source](https://synbiobeta.com/ecovative-announces-mycoflex-tm-the-next-generation-mycelium-biofabrication-platform/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nNonetheless, there are already buildings in the world made of fungi. The first large-scale structure made from mycelium bricks was the MoMA PS1 Young Architect’s Program’s [winning entry “Hy-Fi”](https://www.archdaily.com/477912/behind-hy-fi-the-entirely-organic-compostable-tower-that-won-moma-ps1-young-architect-s-program-2014?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in 2014 which was built with material from Ecovative. After the exhibition, the bricks were composted and used as fertiliser.\n\n![](https://www.certifiedenergy.com.au/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/hyfi_01-1.jpg?width=1200\u0026name=hyfi_01-1.jpg) _The “Hy-Fi” structure made out of mycelium bricks (Credit: [The Living New York](http://www.thelivingnewyork.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))_\n\nGoing a step further, the architecture studio Redhouse has designed a whole mushroom-based ecosystem. The studio’s “[BioHAB](https://www.bio-hab.org/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)” runs as a pilot project in Namibia: an invasive plant species is harvested to be used as a growth substrate for mushrooms that can then be eaten and sold. The leftover mycelium bricks from the mushroom farm are subsequently [used to build houses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsF5L_SjVU\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials). Redhouse has also developed the [Biocycler](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2020/08/magic-mushrooms-turn-construction-waste-into-building-blocks?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), a machine that grinds cellulose-containing construction waste, then re-binds the pieces with fungi and calcite-producing microbes into a new durable material, which is then processed into blocks.\n\nAnother project exploring the possibilities of fungal architecture is the [FUNGAR project](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-future-homes-fungus.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), which not only experiments with building structures out of mycelium, but also integrating living fungi into construction. (More about that in an upcoming episode!)\n\n---\n\n## Special materials\n\nSome more niche applications of fungal material are found in mortuaries. Many fungi are saprobes - or “eaters of the dead”. Artist Jae Rhim Lee took this literally and designed a [burial suit](https://www.ted.com/talks/jae_rhim_lee_my_mushroom_burial_suit?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#t-145875) that is infused with mushroom spores and mycelium, which can speed up decomposition and help break down the [over 200 toxic chemicals](https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/pdf/FourthReport_UpdatedTables_Feb2015.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) that are found in a human body. For the complete fungi burial experience, Loop of Life offers a [coffin](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/15/first-funeral-living-coffin-made-mushroom-fibre-netherlands?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) made entirely out of mycelium (with technology licensed from Ecovative).\n\nOther emerging applications of fungal material are in the field of biomedical engineering and cell cultivation. The cells used in tissue engineering and lab-grown meat production need a scaffold to grow on. This can be [provided](https://www.excell.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) by the intricate network of mycelium, which is both compatible with cell growth and [edible](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/61cfd1ef-0247-420b-8357-2e7df4405d2c?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials). Additionally, sheets made from mycelium have been shown to improve wound healing [7] and could find applications in medicine.\n\nAs early as in the 1950s, [patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2811442A/en?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) have been granted for including fungi in the papermaking process to improve fire resistance of paper. Newer studies describe nanopaper containing mycelium compounds with uses as specialised membranes, filters and packaging [8].\n\nIt doesn’t stop there. Other applications for mycelium materials include [sound absorbers](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-fungus-absorber.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and [ear plugs](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/you-could-soon-be-wearing-earplugs-made-of-fungus?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), biodegradable floating wetland panels for habitat creation and shoreline protection [9], and rigid mycelium films that can become a replacement for the widely-used plastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [2].\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/558ff614e4b0344a8c4a8f8c/1559319978759-ELDJNT8TI334A7FULJME/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHtg_DnDrK_LBDO9Fa4RYlwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcLthF_aOEGVRewCT7qiippn-XpjDz03HNDv6M8zfeJJLnmbprUkN7GH1n-ZhSY7_i/6c7552cc-3fea-4c19-81bb-f53317fda7b2.jpeg?format=2500w) _Acoustic wall panels from MOGU (Credit: [Luca Alessandrini](http://lucaalessandrini.com/mogu?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))_\n\nIn short, there’s still a lot of room for innovation and research when it comes to growing the products of tomorrow. The input influences the outcome; fungi cultivated on one substrate (such as wheat straw) look and feel different than fungi grown on another substrate (such as sawdust). Even sawdust from different kinds of trees can give varying results.\n\nDifferent fungal species can also have vastly different characteristics when it comes to mechanical properties, looks and material behaviour [9]. Getting consistent products at large-scale will be the biggest challenge for mycelium material producers.\n\nThe technology to manufacture fungal materials, especially at a large scale, is still in development. Ecovative first grew mycelium in open trays, but later invented a system where growth takes place in a solid-state bioreactor which supplies air at the right humidity and temperature to the fungi. Currently though, mycelium cultivation is still done mostly manually, without much automation [6]. And, ironically, a lot of plastic is used to make the fungal material, since mycelium bricks are often grown in single-use plastic bags and moulds.\n\nFinding the right customers is another challenge. A lot of the applications of fungal material are in low-price segments, such as packaging or insulation. That’s why at least initially most companies in the area target art galleries, design studios or organisations that want a few expensive statement pieces. To make fungi-based materials affordable for the mass market, economies of scale are needed.\n\nHaving said that, we will certainly also see more fungi furniture, design products and clothes in the future, made by small studios and artisans. The manufacturing process of, for example, mycelium leather is much more accessible than traditional leather making. Growing products our of fungi could become a new craft where artists, small businesses but also commercial mushroom cultivators experiment and develop new ways of using mycelium.\n\n------\n\n_Thanks to Antoni Gandia, R\u0026D Specialist at MOGU and former Research Scientist at Ecovative, for interesting conversations that helped me dig into this rapidly-expanding field._\n\n---\n\n[1] Fungi as source for bio-based materials: A patent review.

It’s been a while. 😊 I started a new job and that took a bit of my time and headspace. In my new job I work a lot with enzymes, which are made by microorganisms, often fungi. So that’s an excellent reason to use this episode of Filaments to dive into the MASSIVE - but to many people unknown - business of enzyme production in filamentous fungi. (If you need a refresher about filamentous fungi (moulds) and their use as food and materials, go [here](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)). Also, this is a fairly long episode, so make yourself a cup of tea, and enjoy. 🍵\n\n---\n\n## EPISODE 4 - Fungal products everywhere, part 1\n\nInspect a package of washing powder and you will likely see some or all of the following ingredients: _Subtilisin, cellulases, mannanases, pectinases, proteases, lipases, amylases._ These are all enzymes - proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions. Enzymes are precision tools that usually do one job, and one job only, and that job is often to chop up longer molecules into smaller ones.\n\nCellulase cuts cellulose - a polymer consisting of long chains of sugar molecules - into smaller pieces. Protease breaks down proteins, lactase cuts the milk sugar lactose into glucose and galactose, and so forth. A lot of the enzymes in detergents break down things that come from food and dirt that might be on our clothes, such as greasy sauces (lipases), fruit juice (pectinases), cake batter and mashed potatoes (amylases) or body fluids (proteases). By enzymatically cutting these substances into smaller components, they are more soluble and more easily removed.\n\n![https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/enzym01.gif](https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/enzym01.gif)\n\n_This is (kind of) how an enzyme works (if it was a person). Credit: [Christian Winter](https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/Enzyme.htm?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)_\n\nAlthough enzymes are made by all organisms, including animals and plants, most of those contained in our everyday products and used in industry are produced by microorganisms, i.e. fungi and bacteria (and we obviously focus on fungi here).\n\nFungal enzymes are used in a **_vast_** number of different industries: in agriculture, research and wastewater treatment, in the production of animal feed, pharmaceuticals, alcohol, fuel, juices, beer, bread, dairy products, cleaning products, textiles, leather, sugar, meat and paper, and a lot more. They permeate everyday life to an extent that few people realise.\n\nThe filamentous fungi used for enzyme production are grown in much the same way that filamentous fungi for food production are grown (as described in [Episode 2](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)).\n\n---\n\nWalk into the production site of a large-scale enzyme producer such as DSM, Novozymes, BASF or Amano, and you will see huge, several storey-high stainless steel tanks, holding up to 300 000 L of liquid. These fermentation tanks (or bioreactors) are filled with a particular species of fungus that produces the desired enzyme, and a nutrient solution containing mostly sugar or other low-cost carbohydrate source - often from grains - and some salts. The tanks are set to the perfect temperature and pH for the fungus to grow in, big stirrers mix the liquid and make sure everything is well distributed, and air is bubbled through the liquid from the bottom and the sides of the tank to provide necessary oxygen to the fungus.\n\nFungal growth and enzyme production doesn’t _start_ in these enormous tanks, though - it happens in steps. First, fungal cells that are stored at -80C are revived in a petri dish where they grow in a beautiful mould pattern. (_Technically, step 0 would be finding and isolating the fungal strain in nature; we’ll come to that in a future episode_).\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aspergillus_niger_2.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aspergillus_niger_2.jpg) _Step 1 in fungal enzyme production: an Aspergillus niger colony that has been growing in a petri dish (on potato dextrose agar) for 3 days. Source: Wikimedia_\n\nThe freshly grown fungal cells from the petri dish are then transferred to a small bioreactor (several litres) and after a day or so the fungal mycelium has grown into a thick filamentous network of billions of interconnected cells, and is ready to be transferred to a larger tank (several hundred litres). There it grows for another day, continuously increasing in mass, until the mycelium is finally transferred to the big main tank where the cells continue to multiply and multiply over several days. The reason for this stepwise process is that the requirements for healthy growth as well as the risk of contamination by other microorganisms can be much better controlled this way.\n\nDuring this multiplication and growth process, the enzymes (the actual products here), are produced by the fungal cells in the tank and continuously secreted into the liquid. The more fungal cells there are, the more enzymes are made and released into the liquid, until the billions of fungal cells in the tank are surrounded by a soup of trillions of nanometre-sized enzymes. All this takes just a few days, and in those few days the slurry of enzymes and fungal mycelium gets thicker and thicker.\n\n![https://www.brain-biotech.com/content/images/News/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Feed-Tanks.jpg](https://www.brain-biotech.com/content/images/News/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Feed-Tanks.jpg) _Step 4 in fungal enzyme production: the main fermentation tanks can hold up to several hundred thousand liters. Source: [BRAIN Biotech](https://www.brain-biotech.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)._\n\nAll that’s left to do then is to separate the enzymes from everything else in the tank. But first, let’s talk about where the **fungi** - the stars of the process - actually come from.\n\n---\n\nIn the wild, many fungi have evolved to secrete digestive enzymes which break down plant matter into nutrients that the fungus can take up easily. Usually fungi secrete a whole cocktail of different enzymes, each with a very specific function. In an industrial process, however, we usually only want to produce _one_ kind of enzyme. So how do we do that?\n\nWell, it turns out that the nutrient source, pH, aeration, and salt and mineral additions and concentrations, etc. all influence what kinds of enzymes a fungus produces. Modern fermentation technology is a highly controlled process and has become so optimised that - if everything runs smoothly - the fungus will produce little else than one particular target enzyme.\n\nAnd of course the type of fungus plays a huge role as well. The workhorses of enzyme production haven’t actually changed much over the last century, and are _Aspergillus niger_, _Aspergillus oryzae_ and _Trichoderma reesei_.\n\n_[A.niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)_ is the fungus that causes black mould on fruits and vegetables (niger means black in Latin) and is used in a wide range of industrial processes, mostly in enzyme and acid production. _A. niger_ makes different amylases - enzymes that break down starch - which are used for example in beer brewing (to improve the malting) and baking (to make fluffier bread). _A. niger_ also makes glucose oxidase, an enzyme found in biosensors such as blood glucose test kits for diabetes and other clinical applications.\n\nThe other Aspergillus, _A. oryzae_, is also called koji in Japanese and has been used for centuries in Southern and Eastern Asia to make fermented rice, barley and soy products like sake, soy sauce and miso. It’s still used for these purposes, as well as in many other areas, because of its natural capacity to secrete large amounts of different starch- and protein-degrading enzymes.\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Aspergillus_oryzae_%28%E9%BA%B9%29.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Aspergillus_oryzae_%28%E9%BA%B9%29.jpg) _Aspergillus oryzae growing on rice for the production of miso. Source. Wikimedia._\n\nFinally, _T. reesei_ is mostly used in biofuel production, since it produces enzymes that break down cellulose and other plant polymers to sugar that can then be converted to ethanol in a yeast fermentation process. The original _T. reesei_ strain was [isolated](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5134823?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) during WW2 as the cause for rotting (i.e. “eating”) the tents and clothes of US Army soldiers stationed on the Solomon Islands. Today its enzymes are, besides biofuel production, also used to give [stone-washed jeans](https://www.worldofchemicals.com/527/chemistry-articles/why-cellulase-important-in-stone-washing.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) their distressed look and they’re added to washing powder to remove loose fibres that can cause [textile pilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(textile)?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1).\n\n---\n\nTo achieve an even higher purity or higher concentration of _one particular_ kind of enzyme in production processes, most enzyme companies also use genetically engineered fungal strains (as opposed to so-called “wild-type” or “classical” strains). Again, Aspergillus is a popular choice, because it grows well, is safe to use and there is more than a hundred years of scientific literature available about it. The gene for a specific enzyme can be inserted several times into the host genome, thereby drastically increasing the production of enzyme per cell. In addition, the enzymes themselves can also be further optimised through biotechnological tools. By carefully adjusting the protein sequence of an enzyme it can for example become more resistant to high temperatures.\n\nGenes from other organisms can also be inserted into the Aspergillus genome, which makes it possible to produce enzymes that this fungus originally wouldn’t be able to make. Let’s take an example. [Rennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) (or more specifically the protease enzyme chymosin) is a crucial component of cheese production, and was originally extracted from the stomachs of slaughtered calves. This quite wasteful and cruel practice became obsolete when scientists managed to insert the gene coding for the rennet enzyme into the genome of a fungus. So nowadays, [more than 90%](https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(17)31054-8/fulltext?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) of cheese produced worldwide uses [chymosin](https://www.chr-hansen.com/en/food-cultures-and-enzymes/cheese/cards/product-cards/chy-max-products?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) made by a genetically-engineered organism, often a strain of _Aspergillus niger_. Compared to the traditional way of rennet production, this reduces cruelty, cost, carbon emissions and pollution in the process.\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Cheese.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Cheese.jpg) _Cheese, likely made using fermentation-produced chymosin. Source: Wikimedia._\n\nMost enzyme companies on the market offer both “classical” enzymes, for users that prefer non-GMO-derived ingredients, as well as enzymes that have been engineered and/or have been produced in GMOs. Just to clarify, however: while “classical” enzymes don’t come from fungal strains that have been changed with _modern_ biotech methods, i.e. genetic engineering, they still have been optimised over the years by “classical” methods. Usually numerous rounds of random mutation (for example by exposing the fungi to gamma-radiation or DNA-altering chemicals) and selection of the best-performing strains, until desirable traits are achieved (similar to plant breeding). Their cousins in the wild would probably not recognise them any more, and the industrial strains would not survive long without their precisely adjusted cultivation conditions.\n\n---\n\nAs mentioned above, enzymes are used in a wide range of industries and products. But why are they still relatively unknown as ingredients? Well, because they are not exactly ingredients. One of the reasons that enzymes fly under the radar, particularly in food products, is that enzymes are considered processing aids and therefore are not declared on the ingredients list on the package. One single enzyme molecule can catalyse the same chemical reaction millions of times, and so a little goes a long way, and most products only need the addition of minute amounts of enzymes (less than one gram of enzyme per ton of raw material). Furthermore, enzymes only work when the right conditions are provided. As soon as the temperature is sliiightly too high, the enzyme is irreversibly destroyed. When food is heat-treated to kill off any microorganisms in the product, the enzymes added during production are taken care of at the same time.\n\n---\n\nSo back to the process of enzyme production by fungi: what happens to the fungi after they’ve fulfilled their job as enzyme producers? After a few days of happy growth and enzyme secretion in the fermentation tank, all available nutrients in the liquid have been consumed by the fungal cells. The density of mycelium and enzyme has reached a maximum. Now, the fermentation broth is released from the tank and pumped into a large filtration unit where the liquid containing the enzymes is separated from the mycelium, either in a spinning washing machine-like drum, or in big filter presses that squeeze the last bit of liquid out of the mycelium, which at this point resembles wet cotton.\n\nThe liquid is then further concentrated to reduce the volume and finally a thick, viscous, honey-like substance chock-full of enzymes is obtained. This liquid is either shipped to customers directly, or spray-dried to get a fine enzyme powder. For specialised research and medical applications, where purity is a particular concern, an additional purification step removes even the smallest non-enzyme particles in the final product (such as some remaining nutrients, fungal metabolites, etc.).\n\nThe filtered-off fungal mycelium is heated to kill the cells and then dried and milled into a powder. This fungi powder can then be used as animal feed or as fertilizer and spread on fields. So in a nice example of circularity, the nutrients in the fungal cells may help grow the grains that will then again be used as a nutrient source in a future fungi fermentation process.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode, **part 2 of “Fungal products everywhere”** we’ll meet our friend _Aspergillus niger_ again and dive into the acids and pharmaceuticals that fungi make.

Acids, are another one.\n\n**_So today, a story about acids from moulds, lemon shortages, and how it all led to the emergence of today’s biggest pharma companies._**\n\n---\n\n## EPISODE 5 - Fungal products everywhere, part 2\n\nCitric acid is THE example of a bulk chemical that is produced by filamentous fungi. Citric acid is used in many more industries than you can imagine. It’s a common flavour additive in drinks and candy, it’s used as an acidic food preservative, it makes ice cream and cheese creamier, and it provides the fizz in products like bath bombs and effervescent tablets. It’s also used in bathroom and kitchen cleaning products, laundry detergents, cosmetics, and [in anything from heroin to soldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2). More than [two million tonnes](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-citric-acid-markets-report-2011-2018--2019-2024-300814817.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) are produced each year, virtually all by fungal fermentation.\n\n![](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/64c38c17-3f4b-4994-8ecb-5999bf0b0e8a.167ac15c41ac895c3c1b9f76232a1890.jpeg?odnWidth=undefined\u0026odnHeight=undefined\u0026odnBg=ffffff) _Source: walmart.com_\n\n---\n\nThis hasn’t always been the case. For a long time, up until the beginning of the 20th century, citric acid was extracted from lemons and limes (hence the name), which contain up to 8% of the substance. Through a tedious process involving adding calcium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, about a kilogram of citric acid could be obtained from 500 lemons.\n\nItaly was, as the main producer of citrus fruits at the time, also the main producer of citric acid. As demand for citric acid grew during the late 1800s, the availability of citrus fruits proved the bottleneck, and the industry was “ripe for [disruption](https://rethinkdisruption.com/citric-acid/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2)”, as we would phrase it nowadays. That disruption came in several steps.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/cFDdEQMGh6UDe/giphy.gif) _Source: giphy.com_\n\n---\n\nFirstly, German chemist and mycologist Carl Wehmer [discovered in the 1890s](https://books.google.se/books?id=fdBMcYg_xGYC\u0026pg=PA140\u0026redir_esc=y\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false) that a specific mould (a filamentous fungus), could produce citric acid when growing on top of a sugar solution. Wehmer called the mould Citromyces (it was later reclassified as Penicillium) and filed a patent for the process in 1893.\n\nMaking citric acid without needing to grow, water and harvest lemons was ground-breaking and hopes were high that this process could work as a replacement. Together with a French textile chemicals company, Wehmer ran trials in large wooden fermentation pans that were stirred by hand. Knowledge about fungal fermentation was still in its early days though, and the fungi often died because they generated more heat during growth than they could tolerate. Nevertheless, the researchers managed to obtain several tens of kilos of citric acid.\n\nHowever, high costs and a lot of problems with contamination by other microbes during cultivation - again, knowledge about microbiology was not so advanced then - limited the success of citric acid production by fungal fermentation. For another while, chemical extraction from lemons and limes seemed much easier and continued to be the method of choice for industrial production.\n\n![](https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0059171/full/1024%2C/0/default.jpg) _Penicillium fungus growing on the surface of a liquid containing nutrients.

Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)._\n\n---\n\nBut more disruption was coming. World War I unsettled the Italian citrus fruit and citric acid exports, and in addition in 1918 the Spanish Flu brought a sudden craze for lemons as a [flu cure](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/foods-that-protect-against-viruses?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2). Prices skyrocketed and a discovery made a few years earlier by American food chemists [Boleslas Zahorski (1913)](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e8/04/a4/05679aaa71d0d7/US1066358.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) and [James Currie (1917)](https://www.jbc.org/content/31/1/15.full.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) suddenly took centre stage.\n\nTheir inventions described citric acid production that was based on Wehmer’s fermentation method, but instead of Penicillium they used a different fungus - _Aspergillus niger_. They found that this fungus could grow in strongly acidic conditions, while contaminating microbes could not. _A. niger_ also produced more citric acid than Penicillium.\n\n---\n\nA small US chemicals company called Pfizer hired James Currie to develop the citric acid fermentation process further and commercialised production in 1919. It was a huge success and transformed the citric acid industry completely in just a few years. The newly developed production was stable and much more efficient than extraction from fruits. Already by 1930, over 90% of citric acid worldwide was produced with fungi.\n\nThis method remains the preferred approach for citric acid production today (as well as a range of enzymes, as described in [Episode 4](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2)). But that’s not where its impact ends. The expertise in fermentation technology that Pfizer gained through citric acid production was later applied to the mass production of other chemicals, including antibiotics during WWII, which paved the way for Pfizer to become one of the largest pharma companies in the world.\n\n---\n\nIt took another 40 years and a lot of scientific research (yielding [at least 2 nobel prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#Discovery)) for the exact biochemical pathways of citric acid production inside (fungal) cells to be understood, and it was only then that production conditions could really be optimised in a targeted way. Improving microbial strains and increasing productivity is still a topic of research and of enormous commercial value today.\n\nYou might be curious as to how this is done. The classic approach is to introduce mutations into the fungal genome, often by UV or gamma radiation. Then the resulting mutants are screened to - by chance - find high producers. However, techniques have been developed in the last decades that involve genomic sequencing and inserting or deleting specific genes in a [more intentional way](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-019-1064-6?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) (as is also done in fungal enzyme production. In this way, strains can be developed that not only produce more product, but can also grow and consume growth materials that were previously unsuitable, such as waste from agriculture.\n\n---\n\nInterestingly, a staggering one million tonnes of fungal biomass are produced each year as a side product from citric acid production alone (as well as over 10 million tonnes of fungal and bacterial biomass from other acid fermentations), making it an undervalued, high-protein resource that could be used in food supplements and food production. Currently, this material is used to feed animals or is spread on fields, but there’s no reason why it couldn’t be more efficiently used as a direct protein source for humans.\n\n---\n\nOh, and if you’re wondering what happened to the less-optimal citric acid production process discovered by Carl Wehmer in the 1890s, then you might be interested to know that it had far greater impact in another industry. While not ideal for Wehmer’s Penicillium mould, lactic acid bacteria thrived [under the conditions provided](https://books.google.se/books?id=fdBMcYg_xGYC\u0026pg=PA140\u0026redir_esc=y\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false). The lactic acid that these microbes produce is another widely used ingredient in food and pharmaceutical products.\n\nWehmer started work as a consultant for industrial chemical producer Albert Boehringer, and developed his lactic acid production by bacterial fermentation on an industrial scale. The company that Boehringer founded, Boehringer Ingelheim, is today, like Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode, we’ll round up “Fungal products everywhere” with a look at all the medical uses that fungi (can) have. Enjoy the summer! ☀️ If you want to get your vitamin D without exposing yourself too much to the sun, just put some mushrooms out in direct sunlight before you eat them.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

What would you tell your past selves about how their efforts are paying off?_\n\nThings are going quite well, even though 2020 has been crazy so far (and it might get even crazier with the US presidential elections happening tomorrow). There's a pandemic going on, which is strange and changed the lives of most people on earth. I haven't been anywhere really in the last 9 months, not further than walking distance from home basically. Most of the time it's ok, but there are times when I feel quite trapped and want to visit my parents and sister, etc. \nSo aside from that, I also quit my promising start-up CTO job, because my boss was a dick, tried to come to terms with some private stuff, and I'm now trying to figure out what my next \"career steps\" are going to be. What do I want to do for the next years? Should I start my own business? Should I move to another country? I'm super indecisive and I'm not sure there's a right answer to any of these questions. \nI was worried when I quite at Mycorena that I might soon regret it and feel like I threw away an opportunity. But, after a few weeks of feeling a bit stressed because of it, I feel much better now. Life's too short to be mistreated. It was a good decision to move on. I learned a LOT during my Mycorena times and I feel now much more prepared for the \"real\" job market than after my Chalmers time. \n\n**For each current quest** — _How is it going? Are there habits or attitudes you can put in place to make it go better? Should it continue being an active quest, or should you mark it paused, completed, or abandoned?_\n\n_- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person._\nI just recently started doing a bit more exercise (HIIT), and I want to continue doing that. I also want to make more time for meditation and yoga.\n_- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear._\nSewing has less priority for me now, because I started doing much more coding, generative art, plotting, fungi newsletter, fermentation, etc. I think for now it could be **paused** until I find the time again to take something on like this. It's also easier to make summer clothes, so for at least half a year I won't make sewing a priority.\n_- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. _\nNot sure if I am doing well there or not. Kind of a squishy quest. I recently tried to be a good friend to Pawel and Ausra, who are both going through a rough time. But to be honest, it's hard to do that well during pandemic times. But I made an effort to write messages. Talking \"feelings\" is still hard for me and I rather switch to \"distraction mode\". \n_- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology)._\nStill a quest, but also quite undefined so far. Either the Mycobrewery idea will become something, or I work on some research questions in a company or research institute. \n_- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. _\nDon't want to pause it, but same as with the other things, it's harder during pandemic times. We try to take long walks through nice forests, which is very good and I take nice photos. But it's hard to be adventerous when everything's so limited. I don't want to pause this quest, but I need to find more ways of making this happen during Covid times.  \n_- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places._\nThis should probably be paused, I haven't really thought about this quest for months. Although now actually would be a great time to be able to drive. We don't really want to take public transport, but also long for a weekend away and a change of scene. To make this quest a higher priority I would have to take some actual steps towards driving more, like renting a car for a day and drive around, practice \"difficult situations\" in my head, etc. Actually, the more I think about being able to drive now, the more I would like to be able to do it. But I also hate cars and traffic, how is that compatibel?\n\n\n**New quests** - _Are there any new quests you should instate, based on your current story arc and where you want the story to go next? Have you read anything or had any conversations lately that contained especially meaningful topics that you want to do something about? What habits or attitudes could support it? What is the purpose of the quest; how does it get you closer to your cadence?_\n\n- Become a comfortable coder, i.e. get to a point in a language where it doesn't feel like such a big thing to start tinkering around and code something. On one hand I enjoy it and want to learn more, on the other hand I want to keep this road open to future job opportunities that are easier to do remotely. To get further in this quest, I should make coding a more regular task and put time aside to do projects, play around, etc. The purpose of this quest, regarding my cadence, is that I don't necessarily want to be bound to one location because of my job.\n- I want to become more of a fungi and fermentation technology expert. I really enjoy the topics around fungi, alternative proteins, food fermentation, etc. and I think that changing our diets to be more vegan/vegetarian/sustainable is one of the most important things, so I want to be able to put my efforts into this area. Fermentation technology, especially fungi, also have the immense potential to produce things and convert things in a very sustainable way, so that's another topic where I want to be involved in and use my time and knowledge. To be more involved in that, I should become a more active member of something like The Good Food Institute, do a good job writing my fungi newsletter, stay up to date with fungi and alternative protein research topics and find a job that allows me to dig deeper into these things. The purpose of this quest, regarding my cadence, is that I want to contribute something meaningful to the world and use my energy for something that is good and useful. \n- Related to above, but more concrete (because of a newly added cadence): Build my profile as a \"fungi and fermentation expert\" more publicly, try new things and write about it, take initiatives, connect with like-minded people. I should make a list of people who do cool stuff and see how I can connect with them, do something similar or be involved with them.\n\n**Ideal self** —_ Have you learned anything durable enough that it should be recorded in your Rules or Personal Canon?_\n\nI add \"food fermentation\", because I am very inspired by the people that do it and I want to be one of them. It's a nice combination of using ingredients, trying out things, see microbes at work, make something delicious, reduce food waste, preserve something, be healthy, etc. \n\nI also add \"Breath of the wild\", because it is SUCH a good game and every once in a while I come back to it and it just feels so nice. It's so well made. \n\nI also add \"Craig Mod walking and photography adventures\". I just got really inspired by the way he walks and takes photos of seemingly mundane things, but they are still nice to look at and to share. It's a good way of exploring your surrounding, connecting with the environment and keeping a curious and appreciative eye on everything. \n\n**Cadence** — _Does your cadence still reflect where you want your life to go? Can you make it more specific? Do you need to make it a bit more vague? Most importantly, are your quests actually bringing you closer to it?_\n\nIn general the cadence is still true, but it's also quite vague. Therefore, I included a more concrete part about what I (currently) want my future job situtation to be like. I will definitely want to do something with science, and currently fungi and fermentation are my biggest interest. I want to have a research and discovery element to my job, but also an \"outreach\" element which could be courses, books, newsletters, exhibitions, etc. I want to be  a scientist foremost, but have elements of an artist and teacher in it. At the moment, descriptions of people that make me excited are people who do something unusual and combine different things in an exciting way, e.g. a fermentation expert consulting chefs, a curator of a microbe museum, leading a community science center, product development and consultancy for different companies, travelling the world and exploring microbes in different contexts. How do I reach a level of \"expertise\" to do any of these things? Build my profile more publicly, try new things and write about it, take initiatives, connect with like-minded people. That should probably be in my quests then as well, so I'll add it.  \n\n\n**Message from the past** — _Say hello to your future selves. What would they appreciate knowing is important to you now?_\n\n\nCurrently I'm very undecided about which job direction I should take in the future. I've put a lot of work into making a business plan for the Mycobrewery, but I am unsure if it's really something I actually want to do. The research jobs, like Oatly or VTT, seem \"safer\", but I also want to dare something. However, in any of these jobs I can continue to develop and go towards my greater goals outline in my cadence. Neither choice is permanent or cuts me off from any other future things. So try to be brave and be confident in yourself. \nOtherwise, look back at 100 days ago and see how much better you're exercising now and how much better your coding skills are than last time! It pays off to do something, right? ;) \n\n[Cadence](private/Cadence/Cadence.md)\n[Cadence Review](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review.md)\n[Cadence spring 2020](private/Cadence/Cadence%20spring%202020.md)\n[Cadence Review 31-10-2021](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review%2031-10-2021.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:33.835064262Z","tags":null},"/private/Cadence/Cadence-Review-31-10-2021":{"title":"","content":"#cadence #personaldevelopment \n\n**Overview** — _How is everything going? What’s the story arc of your life right now? What would you tell your past selves about how their efforts are paying off?_\n\nThings are good! My last cadence review was almost exactly a year ago, since then a lot of things have changed. I started a new job in February (Oatly) and we moved to Helsingborg. I'm very happy with both of these decisions, although I am still a bit sad about leaving Gothenburg. \nOatly job: \nPros: Great company (good product, good missions, respect and care about their employees, etc.), great colleagues and really interesting tasks. So much freedom in doing almost \"blue sky\" research into enzymes or proteins or carbohydrates, etc. Very self-directed. Good pay (though maybe I could have gambled a bit higher? I get 47 000 SEK per month before tax now). \nCons: Things are quite messy, undefined and unstructured. Oatly went from few people to suddenly a lot of new hires, the lab space is not enough, a pandemic is going on, etc. On top of that, the Technology Development team that I am part of is newly established, we're missing routines, instructions, aims, prioritization, etc. But this is just something to get comfortable with and work on. Colleague-wise, basically everyone has a family with kids, and the ones that don't live in Malmö or Lund and are pregnant or will get kids soon. Not very international (yet) and therefore a bit awkard with Swedish/English, etc. \n\nHelsingborg: \nPros: Something different! After more than a year of pandemic life, it was really nice to have a bit of a change. Location is very nice (right at the seaside, view of Denmark, close to some interesting cities), pretty medieval buildings, found some really nice restaurants already. Apartment is bigger and airier. Big windows to south and north, big studio room with space for sewing, plotting, soldering, working, reading, etc. \nCons: It's not Gothenburg. Smaller and less choice of things. No East African restaurant, no nearby Ramberget and Hisingsparken, no Bohus klippor. Milder climate (and therefore even less chance of snow than in GBG) and not as much nature (Delsjön, skärgården, etc.). And of course no friends. We had reached such a nice level in GBG that we knew enough great people to hang out with, that it was no problem to just message somone on the weekend to arrange a walk or lunch or whatever. In HBG we know no one. \n\nIn general though I am very happy. I regard this Oatly-Skåne experiment very much as a test to see how we like it here, how things are going, what comes up next, etc. I really like it at Oatly and can imagine working there for quite a while, but we'll see what happens. Maybe I can join the Singapore research team that is supposed to be built up soon? Maybe we'll move to Malmö? Maybe something else comes up? Right now, Helsingborg is interesting enough, we found nice nature, we are eager to explore Skåne and Denmark a bit more, want to join some organisations (orienteering? miljöpartiet?) to get some connections, want to improve our Swedish, etc. \n\n**For each current quest** — _How is it going? Are there habits or attitudes you can put in place to make it go better? Should it continue being an active quest, or should you mark it paused, completed, or abandoned?_\n\n_- Be a happy, healthy, balanced person._\nI still struggle with finding a good, consistent schedule to incorporate both yoga and mediation, but also something like HIIT into my life. Of course I'm walking a lot with Laika, but I would like to have more targeted exercise. Though both my physical and mental health have been really good over the last year.\nI will work on dedicating 2 mornings a week to either HIIT or yoga.\n---\u003e ***Pick times for exercise and put it in the calendar. Start a 100 days of x calendar to feel a sense of achievement***\n\n_- Be able to sew all the things I want to wear._\nSewing as a quest was paused during the last year, but I actually made a few things that I am really happy with. I made a pair of comfy linen trousers that I wore almost non-stop in summer. And I made my most advanced project yet: a light-blue corduroy jacket that I also have worn a lot since I've finished it. I am getting to a stage in my sewing where I select my projects a bit more targeted and build up a wardrobe of things that go together well. I also made a few things for Duncan. So I think in general, I am on a good track with this quest. What I still want to improve is to know what to do when e.g. the sleeves are not ideal or when I want to make a more exciting collar. Maybe a Domestika course about drafting your own patterns could be something?\n--\u003e ***Completed***\n\n_- Be loving, open and welcoming. Be known as a reliable person. _\nI think at work I have made myself already known as a very helpful and reliable person to my colleagues. I make an effort in offering help when they can't come to the lab for example and need something. I like to think that they think of me as someone helpful (without feeling exploited). \nI want to make more effort in keeping in touch with friends in GBG, by either writing to them semi-regularly or visiting occasionally. I want to keep track of their life as well and for example ask about their child or how their job search is going, etc. \n--\u003e ***Make it a recurring task in my to-do list app to check up on friends. Make sure all their birthdays (and their kids?) are in my Google Calendar instead of just on Facebook***\n\n_- Play an active and crucial part in improving the world (through fermentation technology)._\nThis was very much paused since I started at Oatly. I kept up my fungi newsletter a bit, but it became SO much less of a priority. I also took up a consultancy job for a start-up (Libre Foods) that wants to make mycelium bacon. Bit frustrating, because they don't actually have any technology yet but completely overblown plans. \nNow after 3 months of settling into the new apartment I feel ready to restart fermentation experiments, and also dig a bit deeper into fungi in general (mushrooms, etc.). I do want to keep the link to it, I am interested in it, etc. But I think I will (for now) do it less as a future job opportunity and more like just a hobby. \n--\u003e ***Paused***\n\n_- Cultivate good taste, have ideas and opinions (music, design, fashion, food). Practice to be creative and adventerous. Enjoy life: exotic things as well as everyday things. See everything as an inspiration. _\nNot so much emphasis on that in the past year, but there were a few things that we did to keep a bit of adventure going, despite the pandemic. We took the train to Borås, we took the boat to Ven, we had a little road trip around Skåne with Chris, I took the train to Austria, we went to Helsingör for a morning. Getting out of the house is good for new ideas and thoughts. It would be nice to have a bit more structure in how to collect and cultivate taste and inspiration. \n--\u003e ***Start using pinterest more to just collect things on the internet that I like***\n\n_- Have the ability and confidence to go on cartrips with Duncan, Laika and friends. Visit many places._\nStill not progressed. I go back and forth between longing for the ability to just rent a camper van and drive across Europe with Duncan and Laika, and not wanting to drive at all because of traffic, pollution, accidents, etc. Paused for now, I won't take driving lessons in winter. But maybe revamp for next summer? It would open up so many possiblities, but how will I get the confidence to drive for long distances during a holiday, if I don't put in the time to practice for a while?\n--\u003e ***Investigate driving schools in HBG***\n\n_- Become a comfortable coder_\nNot so much progressed, because of lack of time and inspiration about what to do. I'll keep it paused for now, but maybe still work on it a little bit.\nChange in Nov: signed up for a Python course and have actually been working on it every day for the last 2 weeks. It's fun and still quite low level at the moment, but it will soon ramp up the difficulty. It's made for 100 days, but I'll stretch it out over longer. Aim is to do a little bit every day.\nIn addition, Duncan and I are doing Ben Collins' Google Sheets course, which comes in nice 15-30 min chunks, and it's a good evening activity together a few times a week.\n--\u003e ***Work on Python course and finish Google Sheets course***\n\n_- Fungi fermentation technology expert_\nI did work in that area as a freelance consultant during the past months, and did not feel 100% comfortable in that role. To really consider myself an expert, I would have to put in much more time to stay up to date with this very fast-expanding field, be in the start-up circles, Linkedin, etc. Not anything I really want to do right now, it makes me anxious and annoyed. I will continue to be interested in the area, but not in a professional way right now.\n--\u003e ***ended***\n\n\n\n\n**New quests** - _Are there any new quests you should instate, based on your current story arc and where you want the story to go next? Have you read anything or had any conversations lately that contained especially meaningful topics that you want to do something about? What habits or attitudes could support it? What is the purpose of the quest; how does it get you closer to your cadence?_\n\n_- Proficient in Swedish_\nI'm surprised that is not on my list of active quests... Now with a job in an actual Swedish company, I feel the increased need to have at least good conversational Swedish. And getting to know people in Helsinborg will also be so much easier with Swedish. So I'll revamp the Swedish learning efforts and will prepare a structured learning schedule. \n--\u003e ***Prepare Swedish learning schedule that focuses on talking and learning new words***\n\n**Ideal self** —_ Have you learned anything durable enough that it should be recorded in your Rules or Personal Canon?_\n\nI added a person on Instagram that I follow. She advocates slow fashion and seems to be in general a nice person. I just get a good vibe from it: calm, cosy, autumn colours, etc. \n\n\n**Cadence** — _Does your cadence still reflect where you want your life to go? Can you make it more specific? Do you need to make it a bit more vague? Most importantly, are your quests actually bringing you closer to it?_\n\nIn general the cadence is still true, but it's also quite vague. My last addition was a more concrete job idea that includes fermentation and microbes. Not so sure about that right now, because my current job takes me a bit away from that. But I am still interested in it and want to continue having that as part of my life, activities and identidy, but maybe not necessarily as my day job. We'll see. I'll leave it in for now. \nI got a bit away from being public about what I do. I put a lot of effort in building an fermentation Instram profile, writing the newsletter and posting on Linkedin for a good part of last year. And then (with the new job) I stopped that, and honestly, it feels really good. Just thinking about scrolling through Linkedin makes me anxious and seeing too much of exciting projects that people do feels somehow less inspiring and more stressful and like I don't have enough time and energy to do all that. So yeah, I'll take it a bit easier right now.\n\n\n**Message from the past** — _Say hello to your future self. What would they appreciate knowing is important to you now?_\n\n\nOh dear, my last message was about greatly improved coding skills and exercise. That didn't really happen, did it? \nAnyway, hello future self! I hope you found a way to get to know some people in Helsingborg and feel more at home there. It will probably not be the place that you stay in forever (will there ever be one?) but I'm sure it will be a place that feels good for a part of your life. Don't feel stressed about things you haven't achieved yet. Try to see other people's work as inspiration, rather than as a reminder that you don't do enough. Take work seriously, but make sure that at the end of the day you still have energy to do things for yourself. And just start something. Right now, I feel like I want to work on some design skills, like learning pixel art or doing a pattern design course. Who knows where it leads, but I will keep some kind of progress log to be able to look back and be proud and excited of all the things that I tried this year. I think that's the most important thing: try new things, even if you then realise it wasn't for you. Document the outcome, file it away and try the next thing. If there is something that fits you, deepen the knowledge. Just read more about it. Go to the library to find some books about it. Collect pictures of nice patterns. Make a database about edible fungi. Make a garden of projects on your personal website. \n\n[Cadence](private/Cadence/Cadence.md)\n[Cadence Review](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review.md)\n[Cadence spring 2020](private/Cadence/Cadence%20spring%202020.md)\n[Cadence Review 02-11-2020](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review%2002-11-2020.md)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:33.835064262Z","tags":null},"/private/Cadence/Cadence-spring-2020":{"title":"","content":"#cadence #personaldevelopment \n## List of default activities:\n- Read a bit of pocket article\n- Listen to (new) music\n- Observe the environment (people, nature)\n- Swedish flash cards\n\n## Things I like to do more of: \n- sewing\n- cooking\n- Yoga\n- sports\n- Swedish\n- website\n- reading\n- creating\n\n## My cadence:\n- I sit in the porch of our house in a cosy jumper and drink a morning tea.

If you didn’t make any money, would you still have had a great time?\n2. Imagine having a conversation at the last cocktail party (or even better, actually have one) do people’s eyebrows raise and say “cool\"\n3. Does the project leverage your unique ability? Why are you uniquely qualified to do it?\n4. Do you respect your customers? Would you be happy to see one if you were walking down the beach on vacation?\n5.

Better possibilities of visiting family, exploring new cities, Duncan can have more connections in Copenhagen and Malmö and expand his network. We could try living in the countryside/small town for a bit, if we wanted to (might require a car...). \n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\nMoving hassle, very enzyme-focussed (-\u003e away from fungi and fermentation topics), probably not compatible with building up the Mycobrewery more,  potentially long commute (depending on where we live), possibly needing  a car (?), corporate interests, confidential information (instead of open source), probably not easy to work from home or be very flexibel with work hours/place, more away from home. \n\nWhere to go after that job? What would be possible in Gothenburg then? \nRISE, Mycobrewery, Chalmers, some other (food producing) company. Maybe travel around a bit after this job with the money I earned there?\n\nWhich skills would I develop that I don't already have? \nIndustry knowledge, connections in the enzyme and alternative protein field, very in-depth oat knowledge that is definitely of interest for other areas (-\u003e allowed to work with oat products in other companies after that?).\n\n\n**VTT**\nPros/enjoy/know:\nJob description sounds like the perfect combination of fungi research and alternative protein research, well-known research institute, half-way between academia and industry, good connections, new environment (Espoo/Helsinki) is exciting, probably well-equipped lab, seems like typical research job, probably possible to work on Mycobrewery things on the side, make better connections with fungi researchers (I already know a few there), probably relatively easy to leave after 2ish years, I know that I like the lab work and there would be interesting research projects to work on. Best way to (continue to) work with cellular agriculture, alternative proteins (e.g. egg white protein in Trichoderma), would set me up very well to continue a career in cellular agriculture and improving food production systems towards a more sustainable way. \n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\n\"Just another\" research job? Would it be a good career step? Might involve an annoying amount of grant applications. Other cons of typical research jobs: failed experiments, publishing, wasting a lot of (plastic) material. Moving hassle, unknown environment, Finnish (after just getting good at Swedish), probably no effort to integrate too much in Finland, bit bleak (?). I don't really want to do some incremental research about making a yeast a bit more efficient in producing a certain protein. I also don't want to work for others to spin start-ups out of the knowledge. \n\n\n**Mycobrewery**\nPros/enjoy/know:\nDoing my own thing, trying out something new, doing something that I admire in others, many collaboration possibilities (with restaurants, entrepreneurs, companies, shops), pushing myself, flexible work circumstances, prioritise what I think is important, create my own schedule, possibility to try many different ideas at the same time and see what works, good time to do it (now that not too many people are doing something similar yet), supportive environment, not much to lose. Can shape in how I want to contribute to the world. Do something that I think is important, interesting and fun. There will always be a \"normal\" job to take on if the Mycobrewery doesn't work out. I am in quite a unique position to try something like that out (scientific background, financial freedom, good network). I would learn A LOT, from customer relations to food safety, from sales to marketing to the actual food fermentation. Very varied: fermentation research, course planning, product development, experiments, label design, collaborations. I already know a few people who are super enthusiastic about it, and I will probably get to know more. I can stop at any time or make it a \"side thing\" for a while if I want/need to. Staying in Gothenburg and keeping our circle of friends. Contributing to the community here. Can take on other work as well, since I have a way to invoice people. \n\n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\nMany uncertainties: How much will I enjoy it vs. how much will I fret over every decision? Can I chill out enough to take it as a fun experiment (for a limited amount of time)? Is it acutally a good/viable business model? \nLonely work (no team), every decision is up to me in the end, lot of hustling (selling, advertising, finding customers), possibly a lot of initial investment, risky, very location-bound (at least initially), a lot of administrative work that I have to do (insurance, taxes, food safety, etc.). A lot of manual, repetitive work (making the food products). I don't (yet) feel confident enough to go to restaurants and try to sell them my stuff. Responsible for consequences of my products. Less security: social insurance, sick leave, parental benefits, pension, savings. Not much money for at least 3 years. Might not work out at all. No \"sophisticated\" research part, i.e. not really involving a lab and a deep research question. Would it lead me too much away from science and being a scientist/researcher? Is there too much competition already? So many unknowns. \nShould I rather take the chance to move somewhere and try something for  a few years before having a more \"settled\" job?\nIn a way not as \"cool\" as other research jobs, e.g. working on transforming the food production system to be more sustainable (animal-free egg and milk proteins, etc.).\n\n\n**Various consultancy work in GBG**\nPros/enjoy/know:\nPossibly varied (working on different projects over time), can continue to work on Mycobrewery for a while, using different skills, good pay, staying in GBG and keeping our circle of friends. Least \"invested\" option of all, I would probably not be too tied to whatever company I work for, which leaves freedom to let work be work and do other things in my free time. \n\nCons/wouldn't enjoy/don't know:\nNot much say in what I work with, might not be what I would choose to do myself (e.g. Astra working with animal testing, etc.). Questionable how much I could develop my skills (in a structured way). Probably no food-, fermentation- or alternative protein-related tasks. \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:33.835064262Z","tags":null},"/private/Job-thoughts/Job-thoughts-2":{"title":"","content":"#job #mycobrewery #startaeget #career #personaldevelopment #oatly\n\nI've been into fermented, sour foods my whole life, I LOVE them. It's good to make something that you love. \n\nIs Oatly just another oat milk company? Currently cool, but not the only one out there. \n\nWould be ideal to combine a lab job (like Oatly) with doing some fermented food production and courses on the side --\u003e \"demand\" from Oatly to be able to keep the enskild firma on the side. \n\nNo one in Gothenburg and around is doing tempeh and fermented food production. This seems like an obvious gap. There are people who found new successful companies in a much more saturated market. \n\nFermentation in food production has a crazy boom right now, it would be silly to not try to get in on this? \n\nIf Mycobrewery, I could stay much better in the alternative protein field that I am most interested in. With Oatly I'd be IN the field, but in a much narrower field. \n\nCapacity to look into other more exciting applications at Oatly? Cheese, \"meat\", etc.? Would that be me doing that?\n\nFree evenings and weekends to do things I love sound very nice. With an own business I would probably always do something for it. \n\nWould having a business in GBG make us \"stuck\" even more here? Do I want that? \n\nNew adventure to live in a different place.

What is the worst thing that could happen? I have savings and most likely get starta eget stöd for at least half a year. That allows me to try out things and see how it goes. I can do everything exactly how I want to. I can produce what I want, design packages and labels how I want, market it how I want, give courses. I can work together with other people on exciting projects, visit different places that produce things, source new materials, learn from others, teach others, exchange knowledge, exchange products, make people excited about my field, etc. \nWith this work I can contribute to making exciting local things, which is something that people (including me) really like and want to buy. I get excited about soda from GBG, chocolates from GBG, so why not fermented food things from GBG?\n\nIdeal situation: \nI have a nice production place that I can set up how I like it. It's a nice space and I enjoy being there. It's clean and bright and different things are going on. I make great products that I neatly package and deliver to different places. It sells well and people love my stuff. It's fun to experiment around and I have established a subscription system where I can try out new products. There's a nice community of other people producing local delicacies. I'm excited about doing some new projects in the summer, like doing a food truck with some friends/colleagues, giving some courses, etc. I am building a whole little speciality shop with all fermented products. We live in our nice apartment and I have a little odlingslott at Frihamnen. \nThere are occasional consultancy gigs that are paying well, and where people want to me look into fermentation-related subjects. I also teach a university course in food fermentation. I'm still doing my fungi newsletter and I'm up to date and involved in the alternative protein field. \nIt's good that I started this business because people are really interested in fermented food products, for health and taste reasons, and I even think about opening a web shop. \n--\u003e I think it's likely that the interest for fermented food products is only growing and that people are excited about GBG-produced products. Of course it will be a hassle to sell things, but maybe it's also fun to get people excited about my products. In between the production I have enough time to work on other projects that are related to my area of expertise and I feel like I'm contributing to the field and it's nice to collaborate with other people. \n\nWorst situation: \nI try to get something going, but the interest is not really there. I get a bit bored making food and worry that people don't like the taste or that it goes bad. It doesn't sell well and I stand at REKO Ring and sell 5 jars. In between it's a lot of hustling and I don't feel like I'm doing enough intellectually challenging things or using my knowledge best. Consultancy gigs are sparse, I just don't have the industry knowledge that companies want. I invested quite a lot of money into the business and haven't earned much. \n--\u003e Producing and selling the products will at times feel a bit menial and like not what I actually want to do. It's hard work and it feels like it's not paying off. My former colleagues are working in fancy labs and chat about interesting topics, whereas I am making another 100 kg batch of Sauerkraut.

Would it feel like I should have done it and caved in for the safe option? \nOr would I be happy to have a job that uses my expertise well? A team that is friendly and works together, a good work environment, and products that I like? And that I don't have to deal with all the parts of running a business that I know I wouldn't enjoy. Now I can really focus on being a researcher again.\nWhat is the worst that could happen? We move to Helsingborg and don't like it as much as Gothenburg. But we can explore new areas and new things. I make a ton of connections at Oatly and with other companies, gain insights into the industry, use my scientific expertise, etc. I have a safe income that I can put towards good things and don't have to worry about anything else than what's going on in the 8 hours of work. During the commute I can read and listen to music, in the evenings I don't have to think or worry about work things. I am excited about being in a lab again, having colleagues, discussing projects, doing good work and feeling like I accomplished something. People are excited when I tell them I work at Oatly. I can still do some Reko ring or small scale production and knowledge sharing, if that's something I want to keep up. \n\nIdeal situation: \nWe find a nice apartment in Helsingborg that allows me to have a relatively short commute. I arrange for working from home 2 days a week. Or we even stay mainly in GBG and I work in the lab Mon-Wed and come home Thu-Son. We still see our friends occasionally, but we also make new nice friends. It's exciting to see new places and we take the ferry and the trains all over the place. At work I feel at home in the lab and I like the planning and setting up experiments. The work is a bit unstructured but allows for own planning and direction, and the team leader is very open to input. I am doing exciting things and can look into different areas that I think are interesting. Oatly has some exciting plans that I can be a part in realising. If I decide to leave in a few years, I have a lot of new experience in the field and am much better set up to consult in the area. \n--\u003e Helsingborg is probably nice, if probably a bit more boring than GBG. But there are better connections to other places. Pay is good and we save money to put into nice holidays. Time management is flexible and I don't feel like I'm slaving my life away. \n\nWorst situation:\nHelsingborg is boring and we don't find new friends. The commute is longer than expected and tedious. Due to Covid, it's hard to find myself part of the team, and the whole situtation is a bit unorganised and chaotic. Nevertheless, pressure to produce results is on, since Oatly is expanding massively. I have to look into a lot of patents and literature stuff and it's super boring. When I'm in the lab, things don't work properly and it's super tedious. The things I should investigate don't really interest me much, like how to make oat milk production 2% faster. Someone else is doing a \"Mycobrewery\" in Gothenburg and I feel like I missed a chance. After half a year I want to quit, but I can't because that would look really bad on my CV. \n--\u003e Not very likely that we absolutely hate it in HB. Also not very likely that I absolutely hate it at Oatly. But of course I have forgotten how annoying it can be to work in the lab, when experiments fail and you don't know why. The feeling of wasting resources for nothing. The feeling of not really contributing much to anything.

Then build on this brand for more things.\n-   Starting off in an already food-grade place is good. A lot of craft breweries have some capacity that they might be happy to rent out. Vega has a nice kitchen that they currently use only for Fridays and Saturdays. `—\u003e contact Magus, maybe there might be even some collaboration possible? Smoked tempeh?They smoke a lot of things themselves.`\n-   Yes Box in Gamledstaden is good for pre-info about starting business. He'll send me more info about which agencies were useful and which ones not so much.\n-   Handelsbolag is easier to start up, no initial money needed.\n-   Building a space/hub for innovative food and sustainability-related products is good for companies that want to develop something —\u003e collaborations, consultancies, etc. At the same time you can make a name for yourself in terms of being the expert and use that for more consultancy work. There are similar projects in e.g. London [Greenla](https://www.greenlab.org/)b, who provide an experimental space/open lab and subscriptions.\n-   Making money with courses is possible, but Gothenburg is not super big, you might run out of people. However, hen nights and company events are always something that's wanted. Basic Theory Ferments: woman won previously the Scottish Beer Brewing award, but then went back to her home in the Netherlands and is now making her own [fermenting everything business](https://www.basictheoryferments.nl/).\n\n**Ram, 01-09-2020**\n\n-   Ringön will be empty from Nov2020 onwards, but they have to keep the lease until 2023. They were thinking about doing a fermentation academy.\n-   He was quite enthusiastic about the concept of my \"fermentation hub\", even (or also because) it's not targeted on profit and scale-up, but more on innovation and community. He suggested renting Ringön from Mycorena and starting the fermentation hub as a collaboration or spin-out from Mycorena, with the backing of Mycorena, but still independently. In that way the premises could be used for courses, open lab, events, food production, trials, etc. The connection with Mycorena could stay purely support focussed with the benefit of maybe taking good people to be employed at Mycorena or using the fermentation hub for grant applications with mutual benefits. He suggested 2-3 months rent free, then also 5-6 months rent free.\n-   Pros: Established facility (not perfect, but working and food grade), good size, good location, backing from Mycorena gives it a good boost, could leave some equipment, keep network, quicker start-off, input from other people, easier possibility of collaborating, more reach, looks better for both sides if the CTO starts something up like that?\n-   Cons: Trusting Ram, possibly not being completely independent (needs a strong contract!), more expensive than I would like in the beginning, too big, many problems with the place, not really mine,\n-   Find out and brain-storm: What are the regulations regarding food-grade, is it only for Mycorena or for another company coming after? What is really bad with the place that would be a deal breaker? What other things would be deal breakers? What would have to be completely certain in the contract to avoid future problems (e.g. independent from Mycorena, not restriction on what we produce and who we collaborate with (no exclusivity), rental agreement with notice period).\n-   Make: Short presentation about the idea and how it could run, for both Ram + the team, but also outside people. Make a more formal list of pros, cons, concerns and requirements for moving into the Mycorena Ringön space. Make a list of people to talk to for inital funding and help and contact them (Yesbox, Innovation office, GU Ventures, Göteborg Stad, etc.).\n\n**Ram+Ebba, 11-09-2020**\n\n-   They would like to do something with the place. Ram already thinks way ahead with having shares in my company, having people pay subscriptions etc. Ebba understands that I want to stay independent.\n-   They are up for trying something, but emphasise that I would have to be the project leader and can in return e.g. get a really cheap rate (2000 SEK/month) for using the place.\n-   Current rent: 17 000 SEK per month. So that's what they want to break even with (or let's say 20 000 SEK/month).\n-   In a subscription model, I could be the first of the subscribers with quite a low rate, and then get comission for getting in new customers.\n-   Restrictions: no direct competition to Mycorena, i.e. no liquid fermentation for fungi as an ingredient. Tempeh and such things are fine. `—\u003e However, could direct competition not be good for Mycorena? Then you know first hand what is being done and you have the first chance to get in on it.`\n-   Things to think about: What would have to be adapted and refurbished to make it attractive for people? What is the demand for people to rent such a space? What could we offer? How much work and money would it take to refurbish Ringön to a certain standard? Who are the customers? Who would pay a subscription for such a space? If you want to make a product, why not just rent a kitchen? Is there actually a market?\n-   `We seem to have a shared vision, which is good, but we need to know more to make it work. Mostly about actual demand and how it could work. I am willing to put some work into it, but I don't want to build up and manage a fermentation hub for Mycorena, only so they don't have to pay the rent and have a good story for their CTO leaving.`\n-   To make it a big thing, we would need to have someone like Göteborg Stad, VGR, Livsmedelsacceleratorn, etc. on board and for that we need to know the demand `—\u003e ask Fredrik about that.`\n\n**Matt, 13-09-2020**\n\n-   VERY positive towards the idea, he thinks well-made craft tempeh would definitely sell to various high-end restaurants (and other places) in Gothenburg.\n-   I should make a list of all possible restaurants (e.g. Familjen, Pigalle-Family, etc.) and he can put me in contact with some people he knows. There is someone called Björn that he mentions has a food truck and is often at Lindholmen streetfood market and is very nice.\n-   To sell it: just call up or email a restaurant and ask for a short meeting with the head chef. Then bring some tasty samples, best is one fairly plain and one nicely prepared (e.g. in a Banh mi with some nice lemon mayonnaise and good bread, etc.) so they see what it can taste like.\n-   Ringön seems too big for a start and distracting from the idea of making tempeh. I shouldn't run a fermentation hub for Mycorena when I actually want to start small. Don't let yourself get talked into something, and be careful about Ram.\n-   The most important: **make fucking great tempeh**. Figure out some recipes.\n-   Getting a small place is easy. All I need is a kitchen and a good storage room. For incubation, I can buy a holding closet for kitchens that can keep a certain temperature (and often also certain humidity). I could even have small courses already in a small space and store people's ferments in some shelves. Matt used to rent kitchen space at night in a restaurant to try out things, so chefs are often up for that as well (if I just need space to prepare food).\n-   For selling to individuals, make it as easy as possible. People can't cook. Marinate it and sell them only marinated, flavoured stuff, so they can't do anything wrong.\n-   `Start experimenting more with unusual tempeh recipes, esp. including Swedish grains and legumes. Get some miso going.`\n-   In the summer, just rent a food truck and serve some things.\n-   Recipe collaborations with restaurant, e.g. exclusive tempeh for a certain restaurants that I develop together with the chef. Can only be sold in this one restaurant then.\n-   In a restaurant, ingredients shouldn't cost more than 25% of the dish. Of that 25%, 2/3 are for the protein, because carbs and veggies cost nothing. Serving sizes for meat are usually 150-200 g. Restaurants often buy from special shops if they actually have better quality. Small batches are fine if the quality is top notch (e.g. cheese from a very small supplier, special organic ingredients from Gröna Boden).\n-   Have a plan for when a batch goes wrong!! You can't let a restaurant down with 20 portions for the weekend! `—\u003e Always have some frozen options going.`\n-   How long does it keep for? If for 1 week, make sure it keeps for 3 (because restaurants will use it for 3 weeks if you tell them it lasts for 1). So make sure you know what happens with the product during storage. `—\u003e Figure out shelf life!`\n-   Map the flavours of the different tempehs to have something to present to chefs, they love these kinds of things. Pairings, suggestions of applications, etc.\n\n**Bo Norrman, 17-09-2020**\n\n**Fredrik Schubert (RISE), 21-09-2020**\n\nQ: Test-kitchen at RISE, what's the demand? What do people need? Do you think there is a demand for a fermentation space? How did it go with your kombucha production, did you have a possibility of making it somewhere? Are there places out there? If yes, what do they offer and how much do they cost? Is there a demand at RISE? Did you talk to anyone at RISE that thought it was a good idea? Who to talk to next? Someone at Livsmedelsacceleratorn maybe?\n\n-   He is quite pessimistic about the \"fermentation hub\" idea working well. It's just too much investment into equipment and doing up a place to make it attractive for customers. And then you have he problem of _finding_ customers and keeping it running. It's very hard to find customers! Especially hard if you don't have a good network yet. If someone like RISE made offered a fermentation facility instead, it would be much more of a clear way for customers, i.e. companies, to come to such a place and ask for test runs, use it as a test-bed, etc.\n-   RISE Forum is a test bed that has various specialisations, e.g. a charcuterie with 10 smokers, a bakery, etc. but currently it's not used very much and only from internal users. 10-15 years ago it was always completely booked, but the researchers left for industry and it was never really taken up again after that. There are plans for reviving it, however, and even of including a fermentation facility. With or without me they will be going to do something there `—\u003e Fredrik will put me in contact with Klara Bååth (his boss) who is very nice and is the best person to talk about my ideas of the fermentation hub. Maybe there are some involvement possibilities in the future?`\n-   He currently has a customer who are struggling with making a consistent batch of organic apple cider vinegar. They can't figure out what's wrong, but they also don't really have the knowledge or the equipment. For someone like that such a facility would be great. But they don't have any money to do anything.\n-   Intel: the government is giving RISE 350 Mio SEK in the next years to build up a sustainable biogas production in Uppsala. Maybe something for me in the future?\n-   Regarding Fredrik's kombucha business: it was super hard to find customers, they struggled a lot. Despite getting good feedback that their kombucha tasted really good. They also had a much too expensive place (miljöförvaltningen checked and everything). They produced up to 200 L a week in mostly 25 L barrels and everything really low-tech and manual. They also did bottling themselves.\n-   He can connect me with a RISE tempeh specialist in Uppsala. Maybe she has some ideas for something?\n-   Conclusion: Negative about fermentation hub idea, but positive about that fermentation facilities are needed in the future and that there is growing demand for it. In his opinion, it would be best to have it integrated in RISE and I could possibly be involved in that in some way.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:33.835064262Z","tags":null},"/private/Mycobrewery/Food-production-requirements":{"title":"Food production requirements","content":"\nInformation from [](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises)[https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/en/production-control-and-trade/enterprises)\n\nBefore starting, you need to **register your business** with the local authorities, mostly Miljö- och hälsoskyddsnämnden in your kommun (most cafés, restaurants, shops, etc., some exceptions, e.g. if you only occasionally sell at local markets). Usually Livsmedelsverket controls food productions, e.g. meat, fish. Food businesses that primärproduktion (vegetables, bees) need approval from the länsstyrelse. You have to pay the fees for registrations and inspections. You have to tell the responsible authorities if you change or stop your operations.\n\nThe company needs to have **suitable equipment, facilities and a system for own checks**. Everyone handling food along the whole production chain needs to be aware of hygiene risks and own control systems need to be in place.\n\nThe production facility needs to be approved by Livsmedelsverket if it delivers to other food producers. What is needed to register for approval? Name and address, org number or personnummer, location of production, description of production. The responsible authorities have forms for registration. A registration is not an approval yet! A decision about the registration will be reached in 2 weeks. Production can be started 2 weeks after a complete registration has been sent in to Livsmedelsverket. After that, an appointment for surveying will be made (which costs), and after that a yearly fee is required.\n\nOther requirements have to be fulfilled as well, e.g. regarding Skatteverket, Bolagsverket, sophämtning, källsortering, farligt avfall, etc.\n\nFood production in your own kitchen is allowed if it fulfills the requirements for hygienic food production. You have to contact miljökontoret in your kommun and they will say if you can register your food production. The main requirements are that the food is produced in a safe way and that the person producing the food has the right knowledge, routines in place that prevent risks and does regular self controls.\n\nRules for labelling of food products: [](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/0905.html)[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/0905.html](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/0905.html)\n\nEU Lebensmittelrecht: [](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002R0178-20180701\u0026qid=1562918485615\u0026from=SV)[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002R0178-20180701\u0026qid=1562918485615\u0026from=SV](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002R0178-20180701\u0026qid=1562918485615\u0026from=SV)\n\n**HACCP for small-scale breweries in Sweden**: [](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/produktion-handel-kontroll/branschriktlinjer/industry-guidelines-for-brewers.pdf)[https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/produktion-handel-kontroll/branschriktlinjer/industry-guidelines-for-brewers.pdf](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/produktion-handel-kontroll/branschriktlinjer/industry-guidelines-for-brewers.pdf)\n\n**Check food recalls in the EU**: [](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=searchForm#)[https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=searchForm#](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=searchForm#) (nothing found with subject \"Tempeh\") [](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en)[https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en)\n\n## Food Safety regarding tempeh\n\n[](http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206)[http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206](http://food-safety.guru/archives/2206): Basically, keep the beans below pH 4.3 and oxygen at all times, make sure the Rhizopus outcompetes quickly.

The main focus will be food and beverage production, courses, education and knowledge creation, as well as in the further future a test-bed for the development of home fermentation kits.\n\nBy building up The Mycobrewery, we will gain knowledge about growing and propagating mushrooms and fungi, get a network of customers, be involved in different projects, develop the business further and spread out into other areas.\n\nThe Mushroom Brewery should have a focus on sustainable growth, sustainable production, community, quality and scientific expertise. It should not be run as a \"DIY farm\", but rather as a more sophisticated, cool and futuristic, but still approachable and friendly, knowledge and production centre. Research can and should be a part of the concept, where new applications of fungi are tested and further developed, ideally in collaboration with a university or company.\n\n\n# Concept 1: Mushroom farm, expanding into other businesses, focused on selling products\n\n## What are the products and the necessary steps?\n\n### Step 1\n\nSmall-scale mushroom farming for local restaurants and private customers. Small-scale tempeh production (different grains, different pulses, marinated) for local restaurants and customers.\n\nInvestigate interest (mostly from restaurants around), scout for places (how big, how central, minimum requirements), talk to city people, look for funding opportunities, talk to people who do similar things (aquaculture guy, city farming people, microbrewery people, mushroom farms, tempeh producers)\n\n### Step 2\n\nLarger-scale mushroom farming (more volume, more variety) for local restaurants, private customers and selected supermarkets. Courses and education for people interested in mushroom growing.\n\n### Step 3\n\nAddition of more fungi- and fermentation-related activities, e.g. kombucha, \"Quorn\", beer, miso. Expansion of courses and education. Development of mushroom growing and different fermentation kits and equipment for online and at-site sales.\n\n### Step 4\n\nAddition of sales of developed and custom-made home bioreactors and other specialised fermentation equipment.\n\n### Additional possibilities\n\nArt projects, exhibitions, university collaborations, consultancy for companies, online courses, Youtube videos, recipes, product development, city development collaborations, resource use, newsletter, book, talks, podcast, open lab, etc.\n\n\n## Who are customers and who can be involved?\n\n-   Local restaurants (mainly New Nordic cuisine, vegetarian/vegan places, independent café and caterers)\n-   Individual customers that buy the products\n-   Individuals interested in growing mushrooms, brewing beer, fermentation, mycology, scientific background of fungi and fermentation, that attend the courses\n-   \"Event\"-searching people and companies that attend the courses\n-   (Food producing) companies that need some ideas, innovation or testing for either making new products, get inspiration, get knowledge or get someone try out something with their products. Also possible with their side streams, to make it into a new product.\n\n\n\n# Concept 2: Fermentation hub with innovation, education and production\n\nIn contrast to concept 1, this concept is from the start a bit more focused on the \"innovation hub\" aspect. This means acting primarily as a space for people who are interested in trying out and making products with fermentation. Offering a food-grade production place for making food, experimenting and testing.\n\n## What are the products and the necessary steps?\n\n### Step 1\n\nSetting up a small-scale tempeh production that sells to local cafés and restaurants. Trying out different other fermentation options (kimchi, kombucha) and getting the minimum machinery for small-scale production.\n\n### Step 2\n\nSetting up courses and workshops for people interested in trying out fermentation. Coming up with innovative concepts that people can taste and try.\n\nLittle shop with all necessary equipment to start your own fermentations at home. Own-branded items (see \"Branding\" section below), books, etc.\n\n### Step 3\n\nOffering a subscription-based production or lab space where people interested in developing their own idea can come, verify it and even produce it. This would go hand-in-hand with running the workshops on the side and own production of products.\n\nPossibility of hosting events for groups and companies, inviting a chef for catering, a test bed for new products for other food-producing companies (e.g. Mycorena), verifying small batches of products, local production.\n\nApplying for funding for developing the concept further, collaborating with other food producers, \"waste\" producers, etc.\n\n# Branding\n\nShould be between organic and scientific. Not too sterile and corporate, but also not full on instagram vegan. Something like [Basic Theory Ferments](https://www.basictheoryferments.nl/) strikes a nice balance.\n\nSimple colour schemes, nice simple logo(s).\n\nNice branding concept, example from Food \u0026 Beyond: [](https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699)[https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699](https://www.fnbcasestudy.com/?linkId=100000014684699)\n\nOffer kits and custom equipment with the branding on it, e.g. the right size boxes for incubation chambers with the right number of holes in it, little packages of tempeh starter with the logo on it, marinade mixes, delux kits including an immersion cooker, nice jars with a discreet logo, little mushroom merch, etc.\n\nNice little sales area with books, products and equipment.\n\nNicely designed course material with logo and good instructions + photos.\n\nGood high quality photos of everything.\n\n# What's missing? Ideas\n\nOrganically produced starter cultures for Rhizopus (—\u003e e.g. Bärta write on their website that they can't get hold of them and that they buy it from Belgium right now).\n\nNo one is making natto —\u003e tasting sessions? Fermentations levels - beginners, intermedia, expert\n\nTempeh tasting map to show what the different flavours and characteristics are\n\nFermentation subscription: get a new fermented product every month\n\nTempeh snacks, tempeh chips, tempeh ölkorv, miso sweets, sweet tempeh, tempeh (fish) fingers, miso marinades (for tempeh)\n\nOffer tempeh and miso kits and starter cultures in own branded packages (with own label etc.) —\u003e check what's important to be able to re-sell other people's stuff (e.g. tempeh starter culture from Indonesia)\n\nRecipe package + right ingredients for small cafés (eg marinated tempeh and lemon mayonnaise for banh mi)\n\nCollaborations and trials with waste from local industries: spent grains, coffee grounds, etc for mushroom cultivation and/or tempeh\n\nCollaborations with Värt: making fermented products out of their saved foods?\n\nMaking different starter cultures (scoby, sourdough, Rhizopus, vattenkefir).\n\nTry sweet things (for something like Café Alkemisten)\n\nAsk Vega Bryggeri for help with smoking. They say on their website that they smoke everything, so I could probably go in on that.\n\nGothenburg is the beer capital of Sweden, so it should also become in general the fermentation capital of Sweden.\n\nBrand tempeh variants according to Swedish cities? (E.g. the Göteborg, the Malmö) Or according to other Swedish things. How Swedish should the whole concept be?\n\nCold-attenuate tempeh starter/strain, so I can grow tempeh at room temperature (and sell the proprietary strain).\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:33.835064262Z","tags":null},"/private/Mycobrewery/Notes-%EF%B8%8F":{"title":"Notes","content":"# Supply shops\n\nSilicon moulds for burgers: [https://www.kitchentime.se/p/form-for-hamburgerbrod-m](https://www.kitchentime.se/p/form-for-hamburgerbrod-m) or [https://fyndiq.se/produkt/mousseform-cylinders-6st-runda-silikonform-bakform-chokladform-vit-f57e41e997a641a6/](https://fyndiq.se/produkt/mousseform-cylinders-6st-runda-silikonform-bakform-chokladform-vit-f57e41e997a641a6/)\n\nWide funnel: [https://fyndiq.se/produkt/funnel-stainless-steel-jar-kitchen-tools-1-pieces-wide-mouth-d-tuba-33b6753302014912/](https://fyndiq.se/produkt/funnel-stainless-steel-jar-kitchen-tools-1-pieces-wide-mouth-d-tuba-33b6753302014912/)\n\nThank you stickers: [https://fyndiq.se/produkt/500pcs-roll-round-white-paper-label-sticker-thank-you-sticker-sc-one-size-5f73b1bfe2894724/](https://fyndiq.se/produkt/500pcs-roll-round-white-paper-label-sticker-thank-you-sticker-sc-one-size-5f73b1bfe2894724/)\n\n[https://fyndiq.se/produkt/thank-you-stickers-seal-labels-round-paper-label-sticker-for-gif-one-size-27541ac456e24608/](https://fyndiq.se/produkt/thank-you-stickers-seal-labels-round-paper-label-sticker-for-gif-one-size-27541ac456e24608/)\n\nStockpots with mesh inserts: [https://cdon.se/hushallsapparater/gsw-18-10-rostfritt-stal-spagetti-och-sparris-kruka-med-induktion-4-2-l-p51432322?gclid=CjwKCAiAiML-BRAAEiwAuWVggl4oq2hHvNoxmlUsGEIeVEhqbzwhps0RYRTtutDzkHnogS-QGTdeBhoC8HcQAvD_BwE\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds#fo_c=1753\u0026fo_k=feef7088b1902d900bdcb930945bd537\u0026fo_s=gplase](https://cdon.se/hushallsapparater/gsw-18-10-rostfritt-stal-spagetti-och-sparris-kruka-med-induktion-4-2-l-p51432322?gclid=CjwKCAiAiML-BRAAEiwAuWVggl4oq2hHvNoxmlUsGEIeVEhqbzwhps0RYRTtutDzkHnogS-QGTdeBhoC8HcQAvD_BwE\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds#fo_c=1753\u0026fo_k=feef7088b1902d900bdcb930945bd537\u0026fo_s=gplase)\n\n# Supplying restaurants and shops\n\nHow restaurants buy their ingredients: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/k7oy9o/what_are_the_differences_in_ingredients/geu5d5l/?user_id=14627167](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/k7oy9o/what_are_the_differences_in_ingredients/geu5d5l/?user_id=14627167)\n\n# Food resilience \u0026 Food systems\n\n[https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/food-system-vision-prize/open-submission/from-the-roots-to-the-future-of-dutch-food-systems?utm_source=FSVP+%26+Food+Grantees+-+The+Rockefeller+Foundation\u0026utm_campaign=d4e998c7b9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_08_FSVP_TEN_FINALISTS\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_term=0_0096613579-d4e998c7b9-215698842\u0026mc_cid=d4e998c7b9\u0026mc_eid=de536459f6](https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/food-system-vision-prize/open-submission/from-the-roots-to-the-future-of-dutch-food-systems?utm_source=FSVP+%26+Food+Grantees+-+The+Rockefeller+Foundation\u0026utm_campaign=d4e998c7b9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_08_FSVP_TEN_FINALISTS\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_term=0_0096613579-d4e998c7b9-215698842\u0026mc_cid=d4e998c7b9\u0026mc_eid=de536459f6)\n\n[https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/Wageningen-team-finalist-for-the-Food-System-Vision-Prize-for-their-vision-for-the-Dutch-Food-System-2050.htm?PostID=18219815\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=rasa_io](https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/Wageningen-team-finalist-for-the-Food-System-Vision-Prize-for-their-vision-for-the-Dutch-Food-System-2050.htm?PostID=18219815\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=rasa_io)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2020/08/13/coronavirus-may-lead-to-more-indoor-grown-produce-coming-to-your-local-supermarkets/?MessageRunDetailID=3177942596\u0026PostID=18399987\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=rasa_io#7074972e1263](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2020/08/13/coronavirus-may-lead-to-more-indoor-grown-produce-coming-to-your-local-supermarkets/?MessageRunDetailID=3177942596\u0026PostID=18399987\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=rasa_io#7074972e1263)\n\nDemocratizing food systems: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0126-6.pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0126-6.pdf)\n\nStories of hope and success in the food system: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0084-z.pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0084-z.pdf):\n\nThinktank Food Tank amplifies activities of individuals and organisations around farming and food production.\n\nIndigenous crops, many phased out due to export crops, should be considered foods of the future.

Calm post-Christmas mood. A model train going around the Christmas tree in the hotel lobby. The onsen was amazing and the massage chairs ate our legs. Fell asleep in the chill-out hammocks. Bought fateful non-alcoholic berry wine in the local Systembolaget. Early on New Year's Eve Opa died. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20191229_153025.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20191229_150746.jpg]]\n\n### January 2020:\nDuncan spent the early hours of 2020 on the toilet because of the Varberg berry wine. \nSome days I want to forget. Then short Austria trip for Opa's funeral (in hindsight the last flight for a long time).\nNot too exciting Gothenburg Film Festival this year, we saw Inland (woman moving to the Swedish North), Little Joe (unemotional plant sci-fi), Meanwhile on Earth (Skånskt funeral industry), VHYes (fake 80ies tapes), When Tomatoes Met Wagner (farmers in Greece). \nBooked all the flights and exciting hotels for our Belize trip in June.\nWe also got our nice teal-coloured reading chair delivered, the most expensive piece of furniture I've ever owned. And one early, frosty morning we started walking Gotaleden, from Kungsportsplatsen all the way to Partille, with the intention to make this our year of walking \"all of Gotaleden\". Didn't exactly turn out this way.\nFirst Swedish Corona case on the 31st. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200107_151243.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200125_105134.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200129_192338.jpg]]\n\n\n### February 2020: \nFabian visited and Duncan went to several museums with him. I sewed a thobe for Duncan and a loungewear set for myself. At Mycorena, we fixed up and started producing the first big batches with the 300L fermenter. So many problems with the steam generator. \nSo many sleepless nights because of Shouty Man. He would often stand on the balcony and spit and shout and curse and throw things. \nFinally I decided to buy a year ticket for Västtrafik. That was a bad decision in hindsight, wasn't it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200206_175022.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200212_160143.jpg]]\n\n### March 2020:\nCorona still didn't seem to be such a problem, so we booked an introductory diving lesson in preparation for Belize. The pool was very deep and somewhere in Frölunda. I got extremely cold after a while and didn't enjoy the diving that much. Nice French man gave us a lift back to Kville. Then we walked all the way to Ringön to check on the fermentations, then had late night McDonalds.  \nShouty Man finally moved out. \nHad my last official day at Chalmers on the 23rd. \nSewed myself a dress with lightning bolts on.\nWhen I went to Stockholm to select lab equipment for Mycorena, the woman at SOBI  didn't want to shake hands. I remember finding it a bit exaggerated. \nAt the end of the month, Duncan decided to get a Corona haircut and I shaved his hair. The shortest he'd had it since his birth. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200310_071237 1.jpg]]\n![[ IMG_20200327 1.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200301_213104 1.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200330_200340.jpg]]\n\n### April 2020:\nBeautiful weather for most of the time. We took a lot of walks to Svarta Mossen, Puffball Hill and Saltholmen. We bought an Axidraw pen plotter and started coding more generative art pieces to plot and put on Youtube and overlay with chillhop music. Plottervision, chillplot and plotspots were born. \nHad to cancel the skiing weekend with Chris \u0026 co to Kvitfjell, since everything started closing down.\nWork at Mycorena got more and more to me. So many (too many) after-work-walks with Duncan were spent on that subject. \nOne afternoon I came home earlier and we had picnic at Frihamnen. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200404_115752__01.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200408_170113.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200420_184753.jpg]]\n\n### May 2020:\nEurovision was cancelled this year. The substitute was a sad show. But some of the entries were bangers. Remember \"Cleopatrrrra\"? \nSome days were already really warm. One day we went for a walk around Eriksberg with Eva and Kennet and Leonet\u0026Björnen ice cream. Afterwards I felt guilty when Eva uploaded a tagged photo on Facebook, because the rest of Europe was in strict lockdown. \nAt Mycorena we had a meatball launch in less than 60 days, a \"Virtual Internship\" and got 2.1 Mio EUR in investments. Still got shit from Ram. \nI made a skirt out of fabric that I got from Recreate Design's bankrupcy.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/101334987_10156848907791780_7487211338003906560_o.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200528_201138.jpg]]\n\n### June 2020:\nOn our walks we discovered Hökälla, a wetland nature reserve near Skogome, and Nuet, a neon-orange wooden tower with a nice view of Gothenburg in the distance. It was an art piece built for the 400 year anniversary of GBG, then almost taken down because of some district re-organisation dispute. \nI quit Mycorena and Ram took my resignation without any discussion. \nI sewed a kimono-style jacket for myself in a pineapple print fabric, and made a little dog pad for Laika. She also got a dog pool for her birthday, that she didn't like at all. Was just standing in the 10 cm high water not knowing what to do. We threw in treats to make her lie down, but that didn't really work and the treats dissolved after a while into a mushy mess. \nThe days got longer and longer, until midsommar was here. We celebrated in a small round in Färjenäsparken. We started quite early, at around 11, and the weather was nice. I picked up some ice-cream from Leonet\u0026Björnen at Eriksberg and then had to run all the way back to our picnic place before the ice-cream melted. Pawel brought Pavlova with raspberries. \nWe decided that this year would be the year where we try camping, and we wanted to start somewhere on Hisingen. One morning we took the bikes to explore some good places. All went well until we reached Skändlaberg, Duncan missed the curbstone, I turned around and saw him fall off the bike and land with head and shoulder on the asphalt. Head was fine, but the shoulder was damaged and one half of his body was pretty scratched up. We took the bus home (the accident happened right at a countryside bus stop) and I went back there later that weekend with Pawel to pick up the bike. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200614_132305.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200612_122040.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200612_213324.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200612_215835.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200619_124605.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200621_103347.jpg]]\n\n\n### July 2020\nFor Duncan's birthday we met up with some friends up on Ramberget and sat on the rocks, drank non-alco beer and ate pink grapefruit drizzle cake. \n8th July was my first day of unemployment. \nJuly was in general quite calm. One day there was a langos truck at Kvilletorget and the queue was wrapping around the block. Not much else exciting happening in summer during a pandemic. We sat on a picnic blanket with David Gilblom and Laika was scared of a giant Bernese Mountaindog puppy, while the queue of langos-hungry people grew and grew.\nOne day we tried to see comet Neowise from Ramberget, but Sweden in July is too bright to see any comet. \nI replayed all of Zelda Breath of the Wild and I never wanted it to end. \nMy garden looked pretty good this year, but all I got in the end were some beans, some peas and a bit of mangold that didn't actually taste that nice. \nBuilding of the new Hisingsbron was proceeding quite quickly and it was fun to watch it take shape. \nOne morning I went on a bike tour up along Björlandavägen and landed at Kippholmen, a lovely little bay that was completely empty that early in the day. I lay on the warm rocks for a bit and read Reaf Life by Callum Roberts, before cycling back home in time for lunch. I had a vague plan of doing that more often during my unemployment - just take the bike for long-ish bike rides to get some exercise and my head free, but that didn't really happen. But 2020 was the year that I seriously took up biking to go anywhere. Except for very few bus rides, I didn't use public transport the whole year. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200728_173122.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200723_173205.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200731_101230.jpg]]\n\n### August 2020\nCorona-numbers during summer were way down from spring, and we decided to have a little holiday after all. I found a nice-looking house on Björkö in the Northern Archipelago, and together with Chris, Stefan and Sarah we went there by Bus and ferry. Walking from the ferry stop to the house took about 30 min in lunchtime heat I think forever killed my desire to go on hiking holidays where you have to carry around all your stuff in a bagpack. The house was amazing and right in the middle of the little town on Björkö, 3 min from the only ICA on the island. We didn't do much, besides getting up quite early, eating breakfast and reading on the veranda, going for a walk and/or swimming, chilling in the afternoon and BBQing in the evening. It was the perfect summer break, and only 1h bus ride from home. Every day I got better at going quickly into the 16°C water and I LOVED the feeling and the freshness of the cool water and the waves. Laika did too, she was swimming with us every single day. I read a whole book (Station Eleven) during that week, and Duncan finished Humankind. I also made some cyanotypes of flowers and seaweeds and got the most tanned I've been in years. On a walk around the island we encountered some serious looking sheep. And in the minigold in the harbour we met a fat, fluffy cat that wanted belly rubs. Late in the evenings we went along the cliffs and watched the quiet ferries ping-poing between islands like some machines out of a Simon Ståhlenhag book.\nWe grew some oyster mushrooms in a kit we ordered online to see if a mushroom farm could be a business idea. One batch was good, then it went downhill. Abandoned the mushroom farm idea. But I also tried for the first time to make tempeh, and that was much more successful and longer lasting.\nDuncan had an exhibition of generative plotter art at Llama Lloyds café. He even sold 2 of the prints (to Scott and Aurora), and it was the first (and only) time during 2020 that we saw many of our friends at once. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200810_160355.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200810_122522 1.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200809_211838.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200814_201843.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200816_081102.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200826_173612.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200829_110308.jpg]]\n\n### September 2020\n\nIn September started working seriously on several projects. I started planning for a fungal technology-focussed newsletter and I developed a business plan for The Mycobrewery, which developed from a community fermentation hub into food production into fermentation innovation with consultancy. I met a lot of different people that had some advice to give and wrote up a business plan. I also started an advanced Swedish course that took place online three times a week from 7:30 to 9:00. It was fun and it felt good to get something done already early in the morning. \nWe did several very long walks, one to the top of Hisingen (Kornhall), then over with the ferry to the main land and then up to Ytterby. Another one to Amundsö. Took the bus back because it was further than expected and it was super uncomfortable because it was so busy and crammed and of course no one was wearing face masks because that was not a thing Sweden recommended doing. \nWe got a new matress that would hopefully cure Duncan's morning back pain. I continued doing many many different tempeh trials. Max near Lindholmen opened, and in the beginning we ate there once a week. The sunflowers on the balcony started blooming, while the leaves on the trees started turning red already. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200905_103652.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200905_125127.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200930_110344.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200926_110418.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20200924_165204.jpg]]\n\n### October 2020\nA guy with a topbun from Uddevalla picked up our old IKEA beds, and we ordered a new bedframe to fit our new matress. My days were filled with business planning, product development, Swedish and coding practice, job interviews and seminars. I met Ville from Miso i Majorna and started thinking about getting a production space. Handed in my starta eget stöd application to Arbetsförmedlingen. Also applied for an Oatly job. \nPawel moved to Kville and we made pineapple upside down cake and watched a lot of Great British Bakeoff. One weekend we walked with Chris all the way to Vättlefjäll and around the lakes there. Then I got a nosebleed and took the tram home with Laika. Duncan arrived 3 hours later, having walked a total 35 km on that day. \nIn the Polish shop on Herkulesgatan I found proper Zwetschken and made a delicious Zwetchkenfleck. I also made Sauerkraut with red cabbage that was fermenting for almost 2 months in our living room. And sourdough baguettes after my dad's recipe. On a walk to Hökälla with Mikael we found fresh Giant Puffballs. Autumn turned the leaves into the most beautiful colours. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201001_214520.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201030_121722.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201010_175757.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201017_101649.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201017_104902.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201019_161552.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201024_120200.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201026_144333.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201027_075951__01.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201029_123338.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201031_091715.jpg]]\n\n\n### November 2020\nI had some more interviews for the Oatly job in November, and Duncan for Possible. Otherwise, November was pretty uneventful, grey and rainy. I put up the Christmas lights on the balcony already on 1st November.\nI looked at several possible production places for the Mycobrewery, made some beautiful tempeh and crocheted a wooly hat. On the first frosty morning we walked around Hisingsparken. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201102_153116.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/DSCF5116.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201108_210443.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201128_090356.jpg]]\n\n\n### December 2020\nMore interviews for me and Duncan, and for both of us finally a job offer. The hard decision to agree to moving to Skåne, start a job at Oatly and put the Mycobrewery for now on hold. \nDuncan gave an online dataviz workshop at Datafest Tbilisi. \nChristmas was calm. Sending and receiving parcels was a bit of a pain this year, since literally everyone was sending their presents and the postal services all over the place were massively overloaded and understaffed. \nPawel came over on the 25th and we drank Glühwein and chatted until late. First wine in a long time, but I didn't get any hangover. Most of the presents this year were either edible or soaps. I got Duncan a little keyboard numberblock and I got a voucher for nice scienc-y jewellery and e-books.\nI gave some tempeh to Scott, Aurora and Chris and Aurora liked it so much that she ordered 25 packages for her and her friends, which resulted in a wild bean cooking and tempeh incubating in the mellandagarna.\nThe weather in December was perpetually grey, overcast, rainy and just above 0°C. Only 24 and 25 were wonderful with clear skies and crisp cold. \nIn the last weeks of 2020, Duncan got massively into modular synthesisers and started ordering the parts. \nI was a bit under the weather just before New Year's Eve, but we didn't have anything planned anyway. It was just Duncan, Laika and me, eating a lot of cheese, watching a stupid quiz show and playing a game about fungi. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201224_193920.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201225_102655.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201225_193457.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2020 Review/photos/IMG_20201229_104747.jpg]]\n\n\n### Notable things this year:\n\n#### Watched:\nSeries: Steven Universe, Picard, Star Trek Discovery season 3, Forged in Fire, Ultimate Beastmaster, The Crown season 4, The Queen's Gambit, Great British Bake-off, Tiger King, Star Trek TOS season 1, Star Trek Lower Decks\n\nFilms: Gymkata, Toy Story 2\n\n#### Read:\n- The Cat's Table (Michael Ondaatje)\n- **Atomic Habits (James Clear)**\n- How to Be a Bad Birdwatcher (Simon Barnes)\n- Tyll (Daniel Kehlmann) \n- The Wizard and the Prophet (Charles C.

Prince Philip died, Republican lunatics stormed the Capitol, the world got hotter, Americans withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years war. \nIn personal news, I started my job at Oatly, Duncan started at Possible, Laika got puppies, Mama \u0026 Papa got a dog, we moved to Helsingborg, I published several of my \"Filaments\" newsletter articles, Duncan released his Loud Numbers podcast, and Angie \u0026 Christian got engaged. \n\n## January\nDuncan's first day of Possible was on 6th January. Laika was in heat in the middle of January and we went to Blå Stjärnan to get her checked. Then everything went pretty quick: Birgitta panicked, Thomas picked Laika up (15 Jan), brought her back 6 hours later and they sent a video about the \"lovemaking\". Job done. \nI went to Landskrona to check out the city and visit some apartments that were for rent to have somewhere to stay during my upcoming new job. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/2021-01-14 14.30.23 1.jpeg]]\nOne of 5 visited seemed nice (the others were too dark, too smoky, too annoying landlord, and too big), and I agreed to take it on the same day: Murargatan 10.\nDuncan started to REALLY get into modular synth.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_20210107_223501.jpg]]\nWe kept observing Laika's nipples for most of January, to determine if she was pregnant. I made a nice green dress that I wore on the first day of work (together with the only time so far that I wore a blazer to work).\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_20210125_102358.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/first day at oatly.jpg]]\nMy first days at Oatly were actually the virtual introduction days. I received some merch to prepare for it:\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/oatly merch.png]]\nSomeone stole some stuff out of our cellar compartment (including my hiking boots and hiking backpack). Ausra got a baby (Martina). I got new glasses. \n\n\n\n## February\n4-7 February was (virtual) Outlier conference which Duncan helped put together. \nStill not sure if Laika was pregnant. \nI started going to Landksrona once a week to stay overnight in my little apartment on a (surprisingly comfortable) air matress that I borrowed from Punchalee. No other furniture though. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/LKR apartment.jpg]]\nThe lake in Hisingsparken froze over and kids were playing ice hockey on it. We actually had quite a nice winter, most of January, February and March were quite cold.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Hisingsparken 02.png]]\nAnd there were large ice sheets on the Göta Älv.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/ice sheets in Göta Älv.jpg]]\nBy that time I still hadn't had a goodbye party at Chalmers (because of Covid), so finally on 20th February Johan, Pawel, Scott and Aurora came for a walk and a falafel rulle at our favourite falafel place at Wieselgrensplatsen. They gave me a big flowerpot that had been decorated by Indbio people and a Chalmers tote bag. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/falafel.jpg]]\nWe climbed the hill behind Backaplan - Arödsberget and looked around with binoculars.\n\n## March\nDoes that look like a pregnant dog?\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/pregnang.jpg]]\nWe played a lot of Gloomhaven online with Chris (through Tabletop Simulator). Bascially all other friend activities were walks, walks, walks. I worked occasionally on the AA9 manuscript I still wanted to publish together with Monika, which took foreeeeever (not my fault...).\n\nDuncan proceeded on his modular synth journey and started soldering his first module (25 March). \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Duncan soldering.jpg]]\nAnd Laika got puppies!!! Lipton, Lexie and Luna were born on 16 March.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Laika puppies.png]]\nAlmost equally important, Duncan got a Tubble!\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/tubble.jpg]]\nI sewed a beige T-shirt that turned out only alright, and then I made a second one with adjustments that I liked much better. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/stefan tshirt.jpg]]\nWe walked through Nya Varvet with Eva and Kennet and ate waffles at a church. We also walked 26 km through Torslanda and Volvoland.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/torslandawalk.png]]\n\n## April\nDuncan and Pawel ran twice a week for a while. We attended a virtual Grandaddy concert, which was lovely - basically Jason Lytle in his little home studio. On Easter Sunday we went on a big walk through Bellevue, along the Säveån, and discovered the legendary Ove's Gatukök, where we had lunch.\n15-17 April we walked all 75 km of Gotaleden with Pawel. We stayed overnight in Jonsered and in Nääs Fabriken. Duncan took a gigantic cheese and onion pie with us that lasted for days. We had fantastic weather (cold enough to not sweat, but warm enough to not have to wear winter jackets) and the whole walk was really enjoyable. Saw loads of beaver chewed trunks along the river. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Gotaleden.jpeg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/gotaleden 02.jpeg]]\nDuncan had a lot of talks about his Loud Numbers podcast and got some merch.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/loud numbers.png]]\nWe convinced my parents to get one of Laika's puppies (since they had been thinking about getting a dog for a while). They were worried about getting the dog back to Austria because of Covid restrictions. I thought it wouldn't be a problem. Oh how wrong I was. \nDuncan worked on \"London under the microscope\", a data visualization/sonification of Covid numbers in London with Valentina d'Efilippo.\n\n\n## May\nI made a top with a much too large collar. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/top.jpg]]\nHisingsbron was inaugurated and we walked on a red carpet over it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/hisingsbron.jpg]]\nWe went to Helsingborg on 8 May, visited an apartment and walked around the city, getting used to the idea that this place will be our new home soon.\nBirgitta chose the right dog for my parents, Luna!\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna.jpg]] \nAnd on 12th May they both came back to us. OMG SO CUTE!!! The first few hours she just sat under the kitchen table and was unsure about the new environment. Weeks of sleepless nights, so many trips outside, so many poops to clean up. Lots of fighting and playing with mum Laika. Such a mischevious dog that kept on escaping the pen. Too many cute photos to include here. Ok, one:\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna home.jpg]]\nOk, one more:\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna laika.jpg]]\nGood thing that I could take several weeks of only working from home. I also took part in a pilot trial at RISE in Gothenburg, making feta and halloumi cheese. That was fun, and it meant that I didn't need to go to Landskrona but could work in GBG instead. Win win. \nWe tried to give Luna as much socialisation as was possible during Corona. Of course we also went to Llama Lloyd. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/IMG_1120.jpg]]\nAnd on the top of Ramberget.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/ramberget.jpg]]\n\n\n## June\nLoud Numbers launch!       \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X17zV8-4CdI\u0026t=6476s\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/loud numbers 1.png]]\nI made a top out of double gauze. So light and breezy. But it ripped on second wear.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/top2.jpg]]\nWe celebrated Nationaldagen with princesstårta and watching Duncan's one-year-postponed citizenship ceremony as a stream. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/nationaldagen.jpg]]\nAfter a lot of considering and reconsidering about how to get a puppy to Austria, we finally decided that Mama \u0026 Papa should come to Sweden as soon as they are double vaccinated. so finally in mid June they arrived and stayed for 2 weeks to befriend Luna, learn dog 101 and take a lot of walks around Gothenburg. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/mama papa luna.png]]\nLuna was a bit scared at first and even bit Mama in the ear when she got picked up. But over the next days they became good friends. Treats helped.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/treats.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/mama papa luna 02.jpg]]\nWe had burgers at Max and an epic downpour on the way home. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/downpour.png]]\nWe also had pizza at Dirty Dough that had glass from a lamp in it. Not our favourite pizza place in GBG any more...\nOn 27 June we met all of Laika's puppies on a meetup.\nI made trousers (and shorts with the same pattern) that I wore all summer long.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/trousers.jpg]]\n\n\n## July \nOn Duncan's birthday we went with Chris on a trip to Hönö and a boat tour to Vinga. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/vinga.jpg]]\nWe walked along Gullbergsvass with Eva and Kennet and had burgers for lunch (then it started pouring).\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/gullbergsvass.jpg]]\nWe paid off the second third of our mortgage. Hooray! Laika and I celebrated with a (non-alco) beer on the balcony.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/balcony beer.jpg]]\nAs a little, relatively Covid-safe holiday activity, we took the slow train to Borås and spent the day walking around. We had nice mezze tallrik lunch and a sit-down in the park. The train ride was definitely the highlight of the trip. Open windows, rolling through the forest, no other people in the carriage - bliss.\nAnother afternoon I went to Kinna on my own and had a little shopping spree at an enormous fabric outlet.\nWe visited Bailey and Gina in their new house in Björlanda.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/bailey.jpg]]\nA big part of July was spent packing things into boxes. I freaked out several times because we have SO MUCH STUFF. \nOn 29 July, we went to Helsingborg to pick up the keys to our new apartment. \n\n## August\nOn 2nd August we moved to Helsingborg. We payed a moving company that showed up an hour too early, then halfway through packing up they complained that the entrance was too far away from the car and that they would have to charge us extra or we help. So we helped. Then took the train with Laika to Helsingborg, went to the new apartment, helped unload everything. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/move.jpg]]\nOn 4 August we took a nice walk through our nearby water reservoir/green area, saw a fox family and henceforth the area was called Fox Valley (even though we didn't see the foxes ever again). The same day we went to IKEA, had lunch there, and then took the train to Landskrona to stay over a last time in the apartment there. We had dinner on the beach.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/landskrona beach.png]]\nThe next day we took an early ferry to Ven and walked around the island. Laika wanted to hunt birds the whole time. Ven was very nice, sunny and hot (too sunny and hot for Duncan). We were some of the few people that walked, everyone else seems to be cycling on this island. It took half the day to walk around, then we had lunch and took the ferry back to Landskrona. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Ven.jpeg]]\nWe tried to test as many restaurants as possible in Helsingborg, as long as sitting outside was still okay to do. We discovered a fantastic vegan Vietnamese place (Chay), an amazing pizza place (Benchwarmers) and a great South Indian restaurant (The South Indian). And we also once had the great idea of skipping lunch and just having sweets at Sweet House Cafe. I had a fruit salad with ice cream and about 10 kit kats, while Duncan had ice cream rolls, which consistet only of ice cream - a whole soup bowl full of it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/waffle house.png]]\n13-15 August we went on a Skåne road trip with Chris. We stayed in a crazy Buddhist temple in the middle of the forest, called the Yangtorp Sanctuary. We visited Stenhuvud national park, Kivik, drank a lot of äppelmust and ate mediocre pizza.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/yangtorp.png]]\nI took a Domestika course on how to mend clothes by stitching and started fixing Duncan's trousers that are all broken at the left knee.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/fixing.jpg]]\n27 Aug we went to GBG for the day to get our second Covid shot!\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/2nd shot.jpg]]\nI took up a freelance gig with Libre Foods, a start-up from Barcelona that wants to make mycelium-based meat. Very nice and overly ambitious CEO, who is completely clueless about the science and realistic timelines. \n\n## September\nDuncan's cousing Becky died, and the extended family had a memorial service via Zoom. The weather was mostly wet, and when we went on a walk through Pålsjö skogen, we saw SO many mushrooms!\nI sewed a boxy jacket (with lining!) with the light blue cordoroy I bought in Kinna.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/stacker jacket.jpg]]\nAt the end of September I took the train to Austria. This time daytime instead of night train. It was all fine, but 18 hours wearing a facemask was quite exhausting. Didn't drink or eat much during the whole travel. \nAustria was very nice, and still late-summery (25C) while Sweden was already firmly in autumn. Hung around a lot with Luna in Zipf, visited Tante Angela, Tante Gerti and Onkel Harald, took a trip to Attersee and saw the mountains. Then drove in Angie's new little red car to Vienna. Met up with Stefan, Stephan and Petra in Augarten, then went to a Beisl with Biergarten. This is one of the main things I miss from Austria: the ease to hang out with friends, talk about everything and nothing, have a beer and let the afternoon pass, take the U-Bahn home. Omg, and the bakeries! \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/luna + family.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/augarten.jpg]]\n\n## October\nWe went to Bosses Mattor to pick up some rugs for our new apartment, since it's so much bigger and has a lot of empty floor. So many ugly specimens in this shop! But we found two decent ones: a round one from very nice grey wool, and a rectangular one that looks like the scraggly rocks of Bohuslän.\nEarly on a nice Sunday we took the ferry to Helsingör and walked around for 4 hours. Cute little city, but loads of \"to let\" signs in shop windows. We found an excellent bakery and took some bread back for lunch.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Helsingör.jpg]]\nWe met my colleague Kerstin's dog Hero and went for a walk with them, then got a lot of apples from Kerstin's garden that I made into apple pie and apple compot. I also grew Koji on oat residues from work to try to make some kind of shoyu. \nWe walked to Pålsjö skogen again and had mushroom and tomato soup in the little pavillion restaurant on basically their last day of the season. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/pålsjö.jpg]]\nWe had the first visitor in Helsingborg - Munir, an old uni friend of Duncan's who now lives near Falkenberg. \n\n\n## November\nWe took a long walk down to Råå, past Planteringen and through tallskogen. Nice area, but not really much wild nature. \nSewed the same trousers for me and Duncan to be able to lounge in style.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/tula pants 02.jpg]]\nWent to a little outside fika organised by our housing organisation Balder and complained about the cigarette smoke smell in our kitchen, the broken door to the laundry room, the constantly open front door (because someone stuffs cigarette butts into the lock) and a missing bike room. They were actually quite receptive, and some of those things were fixed quite quickly (though the cigarette smoke probably disappeared because our neighbours moved out).\nIn mid November we went to GBG for the weekend and stayed at Clarion Post Hotel to treat ourselves. Duncan really wanted a bathtub, since the new apartment's bathroom is much too small to fit the Tubble (which has been parked in the cellar compartment in GBG since August...). We arrived when the big ribbon on the hotel was being illuminated for the Christmas season. There are so many more people in Gothenburg than in Helsingborg! \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/clarion.jpg]]\nThe room was not quite as nice as I'd hoped (probably because we needed the dog room) and the bathtub was only half size, but the breakfast buffet was quite good. We met Matt for an early walk, where we got completely drenched, then I met Johan for fika, then Chris in his apartment, and then I went to Dan's PhD defence pary in the student pub. I was hesistant to go at first, because of Corona and also because I didn't know how many Indbio people I would still know, but it was actually quite nice. On Sunday we had a walk with Isak on Hisingen, then had lunch with Scott and then I met up with Ausra for a walk through Slottsskogen. In the evening we had takeway Indian biryani that was so spicy we had to abandon it.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/GBG.jpg]]\n\n\n## December\nAt the beginning of December, Duncan flew to England for the first time in over two years to see his family and meet his Possible colleagues. Laika and I had the first snow in Helsingborg, which we both LOVED, but sadly it was gone again two days later. \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/snow.jpg]]\nI had a 3-day work trip to Tetra Pak in Aalborg to test some cheese mixing equipment with my colleagues Yoga and Magnus. It was quite exhausting because our host talked without a break, and we \"had\" to attend a dinner in a completely packed Italian restaurant. It was very odd to be in a packed restaurant again after 2 years of more or less self-isolation, and I was sure I would catch Covid there, but I don't think I did. \nDecember was - as expected - very dark, grey and wet/cold, so quite unpleasant and depressing. We bought some additional lamps to light the apartment. After 3pm it was hard to see my face in online meetings, because it was so dark at my desk. \nOut of longing for Christmas traditions and a bit of homesickness, I made a lot of Christmas cookies (but regretted it halfway through baking, as is always the case). \n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/kekse.jpg]]\nWe found a hunddagis near us and tried Laika for 2 half days, which worked fine, so we signed her up for 2 days a week from January.\nOn Christmas it was just the three of us. We had sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes on the 24th, and tempeh Wellington on the 25th. \nI got Duncan a Thobe from a nice, stretchy bamboo fabric, and he got me a monthly sock subscription for 2022, and two nice cookbooks (Ottolenghi, Meera Sodha). Mama sent a finished dress that I didn't manage to sew by myself, and Papa sent a USB stick with childhood photos.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/thobe.jpg]]\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/Christmas 2021.jpg]]\nWe took a walk to Bruce's skog on Boxing Day. And we played a lot of Squash during the mellandagarna in our newly discovered squash place in the centre.\n![[private/Yearly reviews/2021 Review/photos/bruce.jpg]]\nNew Year's Eve we spent at home on the sofa. At 12:00 we went to bed and watched the fireworks through the bedroom window. \n\n\n\n## Read:\n**Kissa by Kissa (Craig Mod)**\nThe Star Mountains (T.A.S.

The snow is still on the ground and we took a walk (10:30-12:00) with Chris, Natasa and Murray. Murray was even more excited than usual, because Laika is in heat right now. \nWork: Filaments episode 3 writing\nLooked at a lot of apartments in Helsingborg and Landskrona and intressanmälade many, only to realise that this is probably completely pointless because it just _feels_ like I'm making progress, but don't actually have a realistic chance for any of these apartments. New plan: make a blocket ad and go for 2nd hand contract. \nFelt a bit sad in the evening about moving and being apart from Duncan and Laika for what will probably be longer than I think. Lonely evenings in a bleak room, etc. I'll need to make some good plans to not fall in to an \"Ås-hole\" and have some nice things to do for the evenings: reading, yoga, listening to music, coding, etc. \n\n#### 10 January \nWork: Filaments episode 3 writing (how is this taking so long??!!)\nCooked: Pizza and vegan brownies\nWalked up Långängen. It was super icy. \n30 min yoga with Duncan in the evening. \nGot an idea to look into capsule wardrobe for work, since I just started wondering what kind of dresscode (if any) there is at Oatly and what I want to represent with my clothes. Do I still want to show up in quirky Threadless T-shirts, colourful tights and sneakers? Time to find a good style! \nA\u0026C's cat Darwin had to go to the vet hospital, since he hasn't been eating for several days. Not sure what's wrong with him. \nWe started doing a Google Sheets tutorial https://courses.benlcollins.com/courses/222121/lectures/3583529 that seems very useful. \n\n#### 11 January \nWork: Finished Filaments episod 3\nArranged some apartment viewings in Landskrona on 14 Jan. Suddenly I got responses from about 5 or 6 places. Seems like everyone's back from their Christmas break now, and it might actually be quite easy to get something in either Landskrona or Helsingborg (still nothing showing up from Lund though).\nWalked around Kville and up Kvillebäcken. It was rainy and all the snow disappeared.\nOrdered a lot of basics from Muji that would work for some work outfits. Also ordered two blazers from Zalando to try on. My first blazers ever. \nTwo people showed up that responsed to my Facebook/Instagram post about giving things away. They took some boardgames, chopsticks, floor cleaner, etc.\n\n\n#### 12 January\nMade berbere (this recipe https://www.daringgourmet.com/berbere-ethiopian-spice-blend/). Also a lot of mealplanning for this and next week.\nArranged some more viewings for Thursday in Landskrona and booked trains. \nAlso watched some videos about design solutions for small apartments. \nDog walk with Ìsak and Buffy up Ramberget in the evening. \n\n#### 13 January\nBlå Stjärnan Djursjukhus with Laika to get the checks Birgitta requires: eyes, hips, knees, blood test. For the hip x-ray she got sedated and she was getting sooo sleepy and it was the cutest thing. \u003c3 Everything seemed fine with the results we got, but when I wrote Birgitta that she also might be in heat since a few days (weeks?) things got super stressful. Might have to go back to Blå Stjärnan to get some more tests done. \n\n\n#### 14 January\nManaged to arrange 5 apartment viewings for one afternoon in Landskrona, so took the train in the morning. Weird being on trams and trains again for the first time in almost a year. About half of the people were wearing masks, but most took them off once they had boarded the train. \nLandskrona: Seems quite cute, loads of colourful Danish-style houses and brickbuildings. Nice water tower, everything's very walkable. Not so many shops or restaurants visible, but I didn't quite reach the city centre (or the waterside). \nApartment 1: Nice and compact, clean, new windows, nice kitchen, fairly new bathroom. \nApartment 2: About 10 people want to view it. Mother with two teenage daughters and a cat still live in it. Only mäklare today that required masks and handsprit when viewing. \nApartment 3+4: Annoying landlord that tries to oversell his nice 1920s building: 5th floor without lift, old windows that can't be opened, not allowed to drill into the walls, etc. Everything's a bit stuffy and mucky and dark.\nApartment 5: Even through my mask I smell the cigarette stench in it. Kitchen window is right out onto the street and pavement. \nBack at the train station I wrote the mäklare of apartment 1 that I want it and later that evening I signed the contract. Yay! One worry less. Moving in date is 1 Feb, rent is 4067 SEK. \nOtherwise: Skåne is very flat, but had slightly more snow than GBG. I was incredibly cold the whole afternoon, just ambling around the city at -6°C for 5 hours. \n\n#### 15 January\nWent to Blå Stjärnan again for Laika's progesterone test. Results showed that she is (was?) at the peak of the scale, which made Birgitta even more stressed and eventually her husband picked Laika up for some early evening hanky-panky with Destu. We'll know in a few weeks if it worked. Birgitta sent some videos of the \"action\"... \n\n#### 16 January\nSpent the whole day editing Duncan's Loud Numbers. Bit complicated, because it has loads of soundbites and a conversation-style bit with Miriam, etc. \n\n#### 17 January\nAnother day with mostly editing the video. Almost done.\nSkype with Hüttners. Angie's cat Darwin is at home and feeling better again. Papa's foot is still painful, Mama's shoulder is still painful. They're clearing out the attic a bit, which has been their main corona activity since March. Papa working on the Chronik, Mama exchanging slide frames from glass to plastic. \n\n#### 18 January\nCycled to Marklandsgatan to meet Ausra for a walk through Slottsskogen. Tires slipped on the ice and I fell, but in slow motion. Met Ausra's baby that is still just called Peanut and is now 2 weeks old. Got all the gruesome details of the birth, and the hard time during and after due to corona restrictions: she wasn't allowed to go to hospital until the baby was basically coming out, it wasn't sure if Marco was allowed in (he was eventually let in just for delivery), she was completely on her own for 4 days after birth because no one is allowed to visit, etc. \n\n#### 19 January\nEasy day, mostly reading and watching Ugly House to Lovely House. Baked a vegan almond cardamom cake that was so-so. \n\n#### 20 January \nAnother easy day. Planned a bit for Landskrona, like how I am going to sleep and how I will install blinds or curtains etc. I don't want to buy too much unnecessary stuff for that apartment, especially since it's going to be so temporary. On the other hand I want it really cosy and inviting, so I actually enjoy being there. And sleeping well is a BIG thing for me, esp. since I have not had a great night of sleep for half a year (I still blame the new matress). For the first nights though I have borrowed Punchalee's air matress. \n\n#### 21 January\nWent to pick new glasses at Optikkällaren in the morning. Took me about an hour and dozens of photos/videos to pick one among 20ish shortlisted. Came back in the afternoon to get an eye test (left side slightly worse due to more astigmatism). Then optician told me that the glasses are too big for the glass I will get, so I should pick another pair. Took me another hour to go back and try to pick another pair. Finally came up with one, only for the optician to tell me I should stick with the original one. Arrgh. Now I'm doubting if the original ones were the right decison (are they too big??). Cost 4000 SEK. \nWeather: SUPERwindy and rainy, mostly for the times I was on a bike to and from the optician. Afternoon we had some spots of blue sky. \nDinner: East African. SO GOOD.\n\n#### 22 January\nSlept on the air matress to test it out (with a matress topper on top). Much better than expected. Felt actually better than after most nights on the actual matress, less neck stiffness. \nOnline Yoga session with some of the Possible crew. \nFirst online meeting with some of my new Oatly colleagues. About 30 will participate in the introduction days next week. It will feel odd to be part of a team again. I was worried that I might get quizzed about enzyme things in my first days, so I revised some basic things like amino acid codes. I never actually learned the one letter codes, let alone the structures or categories. Felt like I should probably know that as an Enzyme Technology Specialist.\nDid some coding (trying to understand JS Promises and asynchronous functions). \nLunch: Take away from Babemba food truck at Kvilletorget (Malinesian food). \nIt snowed in the morning, but it was gone again by the afternoon. \n\n#### 23 January\nCalm Saturday. Lots of sewing. \n\n#### 24 January\nFinished sewing my nice Indigo dress with the bottle-green bird pattern. Turned out really nice, after I tucked in the sides a bit. \n\n#### 25 January \nPacked up some things for Landskrona. \n\n#### 26 January\nTrain to Landskrona to meet mäklare and get the keys. Her skånska was much less understandable this time, but I think I understood all the important things. Brought an airmatress to serve as semi-temporary bed. But I stayed the night in a hotel, because there are no curtains yet in the apartment. The hotel was basic and the room was quite cold (maybe they pumped up the ventilation due to Corona?). Walked through the centre in the evening to get some food. It was pretty empty, except for one small street with a busy coffeeshop on. Got Banh Mi, summer rolls and a chocolate muffin. Ate it in the hotel bed while watching Blown Away on Netflix. \n\n#### 27 January\n1st day at Oatly! Pleasantly surprised that they actually take some serious Corona measures: temperature check at the entrance, mask requirements, limited presence, etc. Met Karin and she showed me around, but there were barely any people in the offices. Got my laptop and an HR introduction. Lunch with Karin (bit shocked that there are no vegan and barely any vegetarian options in the vending machine - need to talk to the sustainability department about that!), then sat in on a call with the new oat breeder. So much is happening in Swedish, think I will really need to up my game there. Had a peek in the lab, seems a bit small and crowded, but they're expanding the whole facility right now. Train back to GBG, pretty empty. Arrived at home at 20:00. \n\n#### 28 January\nOatly Introduction Days part 1: Presentations by sustainability, HR, etc. Nice chats in breakout rooms. The after work activities were slightly cringey and stressful. I participated in the quiz for my team, which went really well (2nd place). Wanted to show a trick with Laika, but she was sleepy and it failed. Felt stressed for hours after that! \n\n#### 29 January\nCold (-6°C) and sunny. \nOatly Introduction Days part 2: Presentations by creative department, innovation, Toni, etc. Today I turned my camera off for most of the day, which was much less exhausting. Feeling good about starting at this company, they emphasise their sustainability thinking so much, that I hope it's actually true. \nShort call with my future colleague Johan Qvist made me realise that I have to really revise some of my enzyme knowledge. \nDinner: Tried the new Indian/Pizza/Kebab/Somalian restaurant \"Singh is Kinng\" on Kvilletorget. Chana Masala and Dal Tarka. Not bad. Tastes quite homecooked, not as oily as most other Indian restaurants.\n\n#### 30 January\nCold (-8°C) and sunny. Morning walk to Hornbach to buy some curtain rods to bring to Landskrona. Picked up my new glasses at Optikkällaren. Cooked dal and Ottolenghi. Otherwise calm day with 2h Skype call with M\u0026P\u0026A, telling them all about my first days at Oatly. \nEvening: Listening to Arlo Parks while solving Nonograms with Duncan \u003c3 \n\n#### 31 January\nCold (-10°C) and foggy in the morning, but already at 9:30 breaking up and getting sunny. We took a nice early walk in the fog and Laika's whiskers and eyebrows got all icy. \n\n#### February\n\nWhat we left behind - DS9 documentary\nAlphaGo documentary\nRe-watching all of Parks \u0026 Recreation, mostly during my lonely evenings in Landskrona.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:34.159068068Z","tags":null},"/private/Yearly-reviews/2022-Review/2022-Review":{"title":"","content":"## 2022\n### January\n**01-01-2022**: Started the new year in bed, cuddling with Duncan and Laika, looking at the fireworks through our bedroom window, drinking äppel glögg and listening to the Donauwalzer.\n**01-01-2022**: Signed up for HGB matkooperativet\n**05-01-2022**: Got a new rice cooker!

More than 30 000 in Sweden in the last 24h. Schools stay open, they say, and the \"stricter\" restrictions will be bars closing at 23:00 and recommendations to work from home.

Saw loads of birds in the garden.\n**31-01-2022**: Got my 3rd Covid shot. My arm hurt for two days.\n\nMade a dress from a fabric I got from Ros for Christmas:\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Jan%20-%2002%20new%20dress.jpg)\n\nI tried some fermentations with oat residue from Landskrona. I mixed it with soybeans to make tempeh (worked ok and got nicely chewy). I also mixed it with koji rice to make a soy residue shoyu. Not entirely sure if I like the taste. \n\n### February\nLaika being in the hunddagis resulted in her having kennelhosta once, and me having a pregnancy scare for her. I wasn't sure if she had been in heat, and still let her go to dagis, and then got paranoid that there couldn've been some unobserved dog sex in the hunddagis. Went to the vet, who said \"probably not\" but gave me a follow-up appointment for an ultrasound. Ultrasound also didn't show anything. Phew!\n\nLaika really perfected the \"I put my chin on their leg or the sofa or whatever and wait for food\" move. Occasionally she honks like a goose while doing that.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%20Laika.jpg)\n\nThe flocks of birds in Landskrona were spectacular! I had to stop several times on my bike home from work to just look at the thousands of birds moving above me. Are they crows? Or geese? I still don't know. One morning I even convinced Duncan to come along with Laika on the morning train to work and walk with me a bit towards Oatly, just to experience the number of birds that hang out around there. \n\n\n\nI hired a window cleaner, since the longer and occasional sunny days really make the windows look super dirty. And they are the weird kind that flips inside out and is scary to do yourself. Half an hour and 350 SEK later they are sparkling clean! Best investement in 2022 so far.\n\nI started a little collaboration with Nina from the Elevate Membership program. We want to visualise something on maps. Will need to use my Python knowledge and learn some things about Open streetmap API, etc. \n\n\nAngie visited for 4 days, Fri-Mon! We tried to take it easy but still managed to do a lot. Picked her up on Friday morning at the airport, then we looked for wedding-appropriate dresses in Copenhagen (didn't find anything), then took the train up to Helsingør, ferry over to Helsingborg, then tour through our apartment, then early dinner at Chay (first restaurant visit since Covid!!). \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2001%20Angie%20in%20HBG%201.jpg)\n\nSaturday, we went through Helsingborg, bit of clothes shopping in the centre, walked along the harbour, cooked nice dinner, watched The French Dispatch (didn't really like it). \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2002%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2003%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)\n\nSunday, we had a nice long morning walk along Tallskogsleden all the way to Råå, walked on the beach, then took the bus back. Played a lot of Zelda Breath of the Wild, cooked nice food again. Monday, she cut my hair, we went grocery shopping, then played some more Zelda and had a long walk through Fredriksdal. The weather all week was amazing (sunny and blue sky, and -2 to 6C). Duncan had a migraine for most of the weekend :/ \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Feb%20-%2004%20Angie%20in%20HBG.jpg)\n\n\n### March\nUkraine war started. \n\nI started a fermentation visualization project with Max from Elevate. We want to collect and show information about different dairy ferment from all over the world.\n\nOn the last of Laika's hunddagis adventure (before we took her out again because it didn't actually save us much time) we finally managed to take advantage of being dog-free. We took the day off, went over to Helsingør and walked to Humlebæk to visit the Lousiana museum. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%2001%20Trip%20to%20Louisiana%20museum.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%2002%20Trip%20to%20Louisiana%20museum.jpg)\n\nOn a sunny Sunday at the end of March we walked to Råå and had picnic along the way. Crocusses everywhere.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20Råå%20walk%2001.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20Råå%20walk%2002.jpg)\n\n\nI bought two jackets at Pingstkyrkan second hand, mostly for walks and hikes.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20March%20-%20Pingis.jpg)\n\n\n### April\nNorway train trip (1-6 April): We went by train to GBG and dropped Laika off to stay with Chris. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Trip%20to%20Oslo,%20Ede.jpg)\n\nThen we went futher to Oslo, where we arrived at 2 in the afternoon. Walked around a fancy villa quarter until we reached the Frognerparken and Vigelandsparken. Had some hot chocolate surrounded by small birds. All over the city were Ukrainian flags, almost more than Norwegian ones. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Oslo.jpg)\n\n\nNext morning we took the Bergensbanan. It slowly climbed up from Oslo towards the highest point in Finse. Almost unnoticeable the landscape turned from early spring back to snow and ice. We were in our cosy train, gliding through the white landscape. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Finse.jpeg)\n\nIn Myrdal we switched to the Flåmbana which crawled down the mountains along the World's steepest railway track to end up in the fjord village of Flåm. The landscape turned back to post-snow spring greyness. We stayed 3 nights at the Flåm Marina, with a beautiful few of the fjord from our window. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Flåm.jpeg)\n\n\nOne highlight was taking a fjord trip from Guldvangen to Flåm on the electric ship Power of the Fjords. It was very low and very quiet, and the whole trip felt like just gliding silently above the water. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20fjords.jpeg)\n\nOn the last day in Flåm, we walked halfway up the surrounding mountains. \n\nThe next morning, the Flåmbana brought us back up to Myrdal. We had the whole carriage to ourselves, and Duncan took out his synth to compose something along the way. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Flåmbana%2001.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Flåmbana%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Flåmbana%2003.jpg)\n\nIn the afternoon, we arrived in Bergen. The sun was shining and a blustery wind was blowing. We tried to see as much of the inner city as possible before it got dark. I really like the colourful houses, the rough sea, the views and the cute streets. We found an excellent vegan restaurant where we had a nice anniversary meal (10 years since Last.fm messages!!) and stayed over night in a hundreds year old hotel with dark wooden beams along the ceiling. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2001.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Anniversary.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2003.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2004.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergen%2005.jpeg)\n\nThe next morning, Bergen was covered in snow. After breakfast we walked to the station, and sat 7 hours on the train back to Oslo, going in reverse from slightly snowy landscape to icy plateaus to Oslo in the spring time. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Bergensbana.jpg)\n\nWe walked around some cool neighbourhoods in Oslo, had Indian food and stayed in a hostel without any (visible) staff. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Oslo%2003.jpg)\n\nThen train back to GBG to pick up Laika, and we were back in HBG at 6 pm. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Train%20back.jpg)\n\n\nWalk in Ramlösa brunnspark with Supansa and Johan Westman (former Chalmers colleague of mine). He works at Chr. Hansen and she's at Lund University. Their two small boys were quite wild.\n\n\nOver the Easter weekend we walked Kullaleden. We started from home and started walking through Helsingborg towards Pålsjö skog and beyond, along the coast to Hittarp, Domsten, Viken and Höganäs. For a very long time, Kronoberg castle in Helsingør was still visible on its exposed position. The birds were screetching and there were very few people on the way. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2001.jpg)\n\nAfter staying in a holiday home near the beach, we took the bus back to Helsingborg to pick up Duncan's phone charger. Then bus back to where we left off, and continued walking to Mölle. Realised that there was no supermarket in Mölle, so we took the bus back to Nyhamn to buy some things. Then back to Mölle. We walked up Kullaberg to the lighthouse in the afternoon. The whole forest smelled of wild garlic, which covered the ground everywhere. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2003.jpg)\n\nWe had halloumi burgers in a pub in Mölle harbour. Sadly, despite staying in the fancy Hotel Kullaberg, our room didn't have enough warm water to have a bath in the evening. The next day, we cut through Kullaberg, walked up Skånes highest point and continued on to Arild, Svanshall and Bläsinge, where we stayed over at a very charming hostel at the end of a very long plant nursery. I also bought a rock painted like a chick from a roadside cupboard. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2004.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2002.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20Kullaleden%2005.jpg)\n\nOn the last day, we walked along a looong sandy beach and sandy pine forests to Ängelholm, visited the UFO monument, had falafel rulle and took the train back home. Laika was a champion and walked all 100 km without any problems. She always had the energy to chase after little birds on the beach. \n\nDuncan bought me cucumber-flavoured ice lollies from the ice cream truck.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20Gurkis.jpg)\n\n\nI sewed a mint green bolero jacket that goes with the dress I wanted to wear for weddings this year. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20April%20-%20bolero.jpg)\n\n\n### May\nJenny, Josh and Helén visited us in HBG over the weekend. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20Visit.jpg)\n\n\nEurovision 2022 took place in Turin. Russia was excluded because of their invasion of Ukraine. We loved Romania (\"Hola me bebebe, llamame, llamame.\") and Moldova (\"Kisinau, Bukarest!\"). Sweden wasn't bad (Hold me closer), Finland sent The Rasmus (Jezebel), UK took second place (Spaceman) and Ukraine won (Stefania). \n\nEngland trip, Melissa \u0026 Nicola's wedding, Torquay: We went to England for 10 days to attend the Amoridge wedding. On the way to Gothenburg we dropped Laika off to stay with Isak, Callo and Buffy. We stayed in the quite subpar Hotel Eriksbergshallen and took a flight to Heathrow the next day. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%20trip%2001.jpg)\n\nThe weekend was all about family and wedding. We stayed in an amazing little bungalow with a hot tub and went into the hot tub about 6 times in the 3 days we were there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2002.jpg)\n\nThe wedding was very nice - outside in a big garden, with the brides underneath a big tree. There was singing (\"500 miles\", Fabian), trumpes, poetry, pagean rituals and vegan catering (including a vegan cake buffet). Next day we all went on a walk across the fields to have a big pub lunch. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2003.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2003a.jpg)\n\nOn Monday morning we went to the small administrative wedding in Eastbourne, and then by train via Gatwick and Reading to Torquay. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2004.jpg)\n\nWe stayed in Duncan's parent's flat on Warren Road and took a nice long walk along the coast via Paignton to Brixham, found a cute café on the way and then took the boat back to Torquay. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2005.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2005a.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2006a.jpg)\n\nEverything was preparing for the Queen's Jubilee Weekend, which was to happen the week after we were there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2007a.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2007b.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20May%20-%20England%2006.jpg)\n\nOne evening we had dinner with Miriam and her husband in Totnes, and one day we went to Bristol. We walked through Bristol and over the Clifton Suspension Bridge, visited the zoo and power walked back to the station to briefly meet Duncan's Possible colleague before getting the train back to Torquay. We spent the last two day of our England trip in Reading, then flew back to GBG, picked up our dog, had lunch with Scott and Aurora and came back to Helsingborg.\n\n### June\nI joined the Community group for Matkooperativet and we had occasional meetings to plan some  member events, like a barbecue (that then never took place because of rain). \n\nWe also joined Helsingborganas Klimatavtal - a little climate activist group consisting mostly of the same people as Matkooperativet. \n\nChris visited for a weekend and we went with his car to the national park Söderåsen. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Söderåsen.jpg)\n\nOn Saturday, 11 June, we visited Karl, Frida and baby Alfred in Kungsbacka. We had a nice walk around the forest, grilled sausages at a lake and then visited their new house, which was heavily decorated with (only?) photos of the three of them. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Kungsbacka.jpg)\n\nBy later May/early June all of Helsingborg's parks had explosed into flowers, especially the Rhododendrons. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Flowers.jpg)\n\nI made diary and plant-based yogurts in the rice cooker (pretty successfully). On some sunny, warm afternoons I hung out with Laika, a book and a thermos full of iced coffee in the park.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Park.jpg)\n\nScott and Aurora visited us in Helsingborg; we walked to Pålsjö skog and had ice cream in Gröningen. \n\nH22 expo was also taking place during June, but to be honest there was not much to do and we missed most of it. We attended one event about a sustainable mall, but it was quite bad. And we bought food at the food truck festival; it was rainy and about 10 C and we ate our food on a park bench. \n\nDuncan and his Elevate gang organized an online dataviz conference and I presented my mapping project of Gothenburg's street names: https://silfaz.github.io/gbgclusters/\n\nThis was at 10 pm on 21 June:\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Helsingborg.jpg)\n\nOn midsummer, it was pretty warm and we had picnic in the park.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20June%20-%20Midsommar.jpg)\n\n\n### July\nFor Duncan's birthday weekend we went to Malmö and stayed over in a \"bike hostel\" (which looked more like a prison cell) near Turning Torso. It was the first proper time exploring Malmö: we let Laika run on the dog beach, had fantastic pizza (twice!) and walked through Möllevången and Folkets Park. We also met two of Duncan's Possible colleagues who came through to study good concepts of car-free cities. We had cake in the park and Laika chased a cat. We also explored Västra Hamnen and had the BEST strawberries from a small stand outside of ICA. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malmö.jpg)\n\nBuffy stayed with us for a few days, which overlapped on the last day with both Duncan's family visiting and Chris staying over to go to a concert with us. It all worked out fine. The first concert after peak pandemic! The Sounds, Mando Diao and The Hives in Sofiero park. Really fun and chill, and the smoothest and most efficient leaving-the-venue experience I've ever had at a concert. \n\nDuncan's family (Ros, Edmund and later also Melissa and Nicola) stayed for over a week and we showed them everything: Helsinborg, Mölle, Helsingør, Malmö, Copenhagen. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Mölle.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Mölle%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malmö%2003.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Malmö%2002.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20HBG.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20HBG%2004.jpg)\n\nThe weather was mostly great, I swam in the sea several times (despite it only being 16-18C) and we had a particularly good time in Copenhagen where we explored the less touristy parts like Nørrebro and the post-industrial area around the ski-slope-waste-incinerator Copenhill and the food truck place Reffen. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2001.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2003.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2005.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2007.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20CPH%2009.jpeg)\n\nThe weekend after we went to GBG to hang out with many of ours friends in the park (Stefan, Sara, Chris, Mikael, Siri, Josefine + boyfriend, Scott) for a little birthday picnic. \n\n\n### August\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Duncan%20and%20Laika.jpg)\n\nThe first weekend in August, Jonas and Lisa visited us from the Netherlands and stayed over a few days. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Jonas%20and%20Lisa.jpg)\n\nI participated in the big Oatly oat harvest for the oat breeding group in a field near Lund.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Oat%20harvest.jpg)\n\nI made a self-drafted summer dress. Duncan sold his bike that had been standing unused in the cellar for 1.5 years and then bought a bass guitar.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Dress.jpg)\n\nAnd at the end of August we went to Borrby for a Hüttner family holiday. We had a nice house with a hot tub and only 5 min walk to the endless sand beach. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Borrby%2002.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Borrby.jpg)\n\nLaika and Luna met again for the first time after separation (and hated each other initially), we took a trip to Stenshuvud Nationalpark and to Kivik for äppelmust, and Angie and Chris got married in Ystad. I also went swimming a few times! \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Balloons.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Wedding%2001.jpeg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Wedding%2002.jpeg)\n\n\n### September\nThe week after Borrby, Mama, Papa and Luna stayed in Helsingborg in a hostel down the road from our house, and we had some more nice walks and trips. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20August%20-%20Pusshållplats.jpg)\n\nAnd I got Mama's old Overlock machine (they had come here by car)! Their trip back home took another week, since they avoided motorways completely. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Overlocker.jpg)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8th September. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/Screenshot%202022-09-08%20at%2020.56.07.png)\n_Screenshot from BBC News_\n\nDuncan and had a little trip to Lund: we walked around, had African food from a food truck, bought nice nail polishes and Duncan bought fingerless gloves from a fishing supply shop.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Duncan.jpg)\n\nI bought new glasses with a clear frame.\n\nBought an exercise bike on Blocket for 750 SEK, and got it delivered by the seller for an extra 50 SEK. We decided to cycle from Helsingborg to Haparanda. \n\nAt the end of September I took the night train from Hamburg to Vienna. I had 4 hours in Hamburg and walked around the city a bit - got a good impression, in contrast to the first few times I had to change trains here. The trip was mostly to attend the 20-year anniversary of my university year: we were about 30 people and visited the Muthgasse premises and then walked up Kahlenberg to a nice Heurigen. Most people hadn't really changed much - don't know if that's good or bad. Otherwise, I spent the time mostly with Angie: we went to the new vegan Billa Pflanzilla supermarket (vegan Bananenschnitten and vegan Leberkäse!!), spent a lot of time in Komolka looking at fabrics, had dinner with Tante Irmi \u0026 Onkel Bertram, and met Stefan, Stephanstefan and others in a pub. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20September%20-%20Percy.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Austria%2003.jpg)\nAfter a few days in Vienna I spent some time in Zipf, which was really nice. The weather was very summery and we visited some place in the area that I had never properly visited, like Ampflwang and Gmunden. I also remember spending a lot of time in the dairy section in various supermarkets to check out the varieties and ingredients of plant-based and dairy yogurt products because of the oat gurt project I had become involved with at Oatly. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Austria%2001.jpg)\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Austria%2002.jpg)\n\n### October \nA few days after I came back from Austria, Duncan went by train for a week to Netherlands and Luxemburg for a Loud Numbers workshop and a data sonification conference. \n\nI got several kilos of garden apples from my colleague Kerstin which I turned into Apfelmus. \n\nI had a health check from work and got pretty good marks for blood sugar, blood fat, blood pressure and lung capacity. They didn't check much else. \nI also got my 4th covid vaccination. No one in Sweden officially recommended it to under-65-year-olds, but it was also no problem to book a slot and show up to get the vaccination. \n\nOne Saturday we went to Mölle for pizza. It was good, but cold.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20October%20-%20Mölle.jpg)\n\n### November\nBuffy stayed with us for 10 days while Isak and Callo went to Turkey. She and Laika got along fine, they're just not exactly best friends. And I will never get used to the weird way that Buffy pees: just standing on her front legs. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20November%20-%20Buffy%2002.jpg)\n\nWe had a Zoom call with Pawel who had just moved back to GBG after a (miserable) year in Trondheim. And we got a new internet provider, which finally meant the end of random internet dropouts which had been especially annoying during online meetings. \n\nOne Saturday we went to a concert in Malmö. The trains got stopped at Kävlinge and nothing continued for about 1.5 h. We cancelled our nice pizza restaurant reservation in Malmö and went to a sushi place in Kävlinge, until we could see the trains run again. Then continued on and made it in time for the concert. I had not realised how much I had missed going out and being among people in a dark, slightly shabby nightclub that smells of beer. It was great! The concert was great too - William Basinski, and pre-show was Elin Piel, both delivering very atmospheric synth music.\n\nI made my first pair of real trousers with a complicated fly zipper and fancy welt backpockets. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20trousers.jpg)\n\nI put up the Christmas decoration early, since it was so dark and grey outside.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20November%20-%20stra.jpg)\n\nWe got a new electric toothbrush (Sonicare!). brrrrr.\n\n\n### December\n\nAt the very beginning of December, Duncan stayed in a \"cabin in the woods\" in Tjörnarp as a music retreat. Laika stayed with him, and I joined for the last two days. We had pizza at the only food place in town, which was only open once a week. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Nov%20-%20Tjörnarp.jpg)\n\nIt was a bit wet and dark, so times for walks were limited. But we found many interesting mushrooms, hear many nice bird calls and even saw hair ice one morning! \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20hair%20ice.jpg)\n\nDuncan and I  joined the communications sub-group of Klimatavtal and had Lucia fika at our new friend Anna's place to talk social media strategy (and get to know each other). \n\nA card arrived that had been finding its way for more than 6 years! It had been sent in April 2015 by Mama and Papa. Someone from the Swedish postal service had corrected the address and it finally arrived, looking like a relic from hundred years ago. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20card.jpg)\n\nThen I got a big cold and stayed home for a few days, but always tested covid negative (even though my gurt squad colleague Kerstin had tested positive a few days earlier). Luckily, by the time I was supposed to go to Austria I was feeling fine again. Unluckily though, Mama and Papa tested positive, so I couldn't actually see them for this pre-Christmas visit. So it was \"only\" Angie, Chris and friends. We celebrated her 40th birthday partly at the Glühweinstandl and partly in a pub. While I was in Austria, it was snowy and -8C in Helsingborg, which I mostly missed unfortunately. Being on a plane again felt weird, but I do love the view of the clouds. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20Flight.jpg)\n\nAngie and I went to Josef Brot about 3 times, and ate Brot und Aufstriche for 90% of meals during the four days I was there. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20Brot.jpg)\n\nOn the weekend before Christmas we watched Home Alone and ate lots of Christmas-y snacks from the British Shop that Ros had sent us. Christmas was pretty similar to last year: we had Austrian style dinner on the 24th, and then Tempeh Wellington on the 25th. This year, the holidays were placed pretty badly with 25th and 1st both being Sundays. But I took the whole mellandagarna off work to really enjoy all the boring things: reading, walking, cooking, sewing, coding, playing squash, etc. \n\nLaika had a bad stomach just before Christmas, so Duncan and I had to get up every few hours to take her out. Then during the mellandagarna she got increasingly reluctant to go outside, because of early fireworks. Poor girl. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/Xmas2022%20card%20Silfa%2001.png)\n\nAt the very end of the year, Duncan's new office chair was delivered. New Year's Eve was rainy and 10c. We watched Top Gun, played Spirit Island, ate pizza and cake, planned holidays for the year and were asleep by 00:30.\n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20Dec%20-%20chair.jpg)\n\nPlans for next year include 2 big walks (one in spring, one in autumn), a big 3-week summer holiday train travel through Europe (with Laika) and two retreats for Duncan (one in spring, one in late autumn). I would also like to go by train through Sweden a bit more (maybe Inlandsbana?), swim in lakes and the sea, go to Malmö some more and stay happy.\n\n\n### Watched and listened\n- Star Trek: Picard\n- Star Trek: Lower Decks\n- Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. _SO GOOD!_\n- Star Trek TOS (Seasons 1+2 so far)\n- The Power of the Dog. _Award-winning western with Benedict Cumberbatch.

Most Sunday's I make 6 somewhat healthy bowls to have for lunches [Lunchboxes and Bowls](projects/cooking/Lunchboxes%20and%20Bowls.md). Having prepped lunchboxes is GREAT.\n- We had Laoganma tofu (with fermented vegetables) and [Yeung Man's Garlic Chili Noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG8KpOvN5V8\u0026t=366s) each about once a week. \n- Many evenings we watched restoration videos in bed. \n- Due to being in the \"gurt squad\", I have tasted SO MUCH (mostly plant-based) yogurt this year. \n- Visiting Flåm out of season (at the beginning of April) was amazing. We had the whole Flåmbana to ourselves and the village that is usually flooded by cruise tourists in summer was sleepy and deserted. The weather wasn't too bad either: nice snow in Myrdal and low-hanging clouds in the fjords down at sea level. Bergen was even sunny!\n- I continued to make a lot of fermentations and sew and repair many things. I made my first pair of proper trousers [Attitude trousers](projects/sewing/Attitude%20trousers.md), a self-drafted summer dress, a self-drafted summer skirt, and I designed a fabric to make a blouse for Angie's 40th birthday (which unfortunately didn't arrive in time). I also learned how to use the Overlocker. \n- I learned some new coding skills, mainly during my project of Gothenburg's street maps. I also learned how to use Github pages to set up a website, and started a [Digital Garden](https://silfaz.github.io/digitalgarden/) (via Quartz) that is also hosted on Github pages. And I worked through about 20 days of the 100 Days of Python course. \n- Malmö and Copenhagen are both really cool places, once you get away from the shopping streets and the more touristy places. \n- I read several books in Swedish this year, listened to a lot of Språket and P3 Dokumentär podcasts, joined the Matkooperativet community group meetings which were in Swedish, and survived the Oatly Technolgy Development Christmas get-together in Swedish. Still not 100% comfortably fluent, but getting there. \n- Fermentation wisdom of this year: Fermenting Brussels sprouts is delicious! So are celeric and carrot. When making chili ferments, wear gloves. \n\n![](private/Yearly%20reviews/2022%20Review/photos/2022%20July%20-%20Fermentations.jpg)\n\n- Didn't quite manage to go winter swimming this year. But I did go swimming in the sea several times this year, including in the harbour at Pixlapiren. And it does get easier when going in. And it does feel amazing!\n- It's much better to stay at solid, simple hostels than supposedly fancy hotels that then disappoint.\n- Gimbap are a great hiking and picnic food: make a whole roll, cut into pieces without taking the roll apart and wrap tightly into aluminium foil or clingfilm. Super un-messy transportation and delicious when at room temperature. \n- Exciting science news this year were the release of AlphaFold and other AI protein structure prediction tools. Also, GPT-3 and ChatGPT were two language neural networks that blew everyone's mind with how good they are at generating text. For visuals generation with AI, Midjourney and Dall-e were two of the biggest things and started a big discussion about copyright and originality in art. COP27 in Egypt was a disappointment as expected. James Webb telescope was launched and delivered amazing new insights into cosmology. \n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:34.811075726Z","tags":null},"/private/Yearly-reviews/2022-Review/2023-plans":{"title":"2023 plans","content":"\n\nSee also [Personal canon](private/Cadence/Personal%20canon.md), [Cadence Review](private/Cadence/Cadence%20Review.md)\n\n## Science\n- Keep up to date with scientific discoveries: Make time (2h/week) to read Science and Nature --\u003e book **Sunday afternoons** into the calendar.\n- Fermentation \u0026 biotechnology: \n\t- Plan it into the workweek to read papers and books, increase knowledge in these areas --\u003e book **Friday afternoons** into the calendar. \n\t- Continue to experiment at home with fermentations.\n\t- Pursue the fermentation visualization/database project (with Max).\n\n\n## Media \u0026 art\n- Read more solarpunk-related literature.\n- Go through inspiration folder and pinterest every once in a while.\n- Take the camera and take photos.

It's for a sci-fi story unusual setting, together with the archaic writing style make it very interesting and not just another time-travelling story. The concept is also surprising._\n\n_As the author writes in the end notes:_ \"Back in the 1990s the physicist Kip Thorne was on a book tour, and I heard him give a talk in which he described how you could - in theory - create a time machine that obeyed Einstein's theory of relativity. I found it absolutely fascinating. Movies and television have encouraged us to think of time machines as vehicles you ride in, or else some kind of teleporter that beams you to different era. But what Thorne described was more like a pair of doors, where anything that goes in or comes out of one door will come out or go into the other door a fixed period of time later. Several questions raised by vehicular or transporter-style time machines - what about the movement of the Earth, why haven't we seen visitors from the future yet - were answered by this type of time machine. Even more interesting was the fact that Thorne had performed some mathematical analysis indicating that you couldn't change the past with this time machine, and that only a single, self-consistent timeline was possible.\"\n\n\n## Exhalation\nAn individual trying to figure out how their mind works and realises that everyone is a machine whose memories are dependent on air flow and entropy.\n\n_From the author's end notes:_ \"(Inspiration for this story came from) the chapter in Roger Penrose's book _The Emporer's New Mind_ in which he discusses entropy. He points out that therer's a sense in which it's incorrect to say we eat food because we need the energy it contains. The conservation of energy means that it is neither created nor destroyed; we are radiating energy constantly, at pretty much the same rate that we absorb it. The difference is that the heat energy we radiate is a high-entropy form of energy, meaning it's disordered. The chemical energy we absorb is a low-entropy form of energy, meaning it's ordered. In effect, we are consuming order and generating disorder; we live by increasing the disorder of the universe. It's only because the universe started in a highly ordered state that we are able to exist at all.\"\n[Quotes](Quotes.md)\n\n## What's expected of us\nA simple machine shows people that free will doesn't exist, and a warning from the future to never use it.\n\n\n## The lifecycle of software objects\nMore a novella than a short story, since it's quite lengthy. \n\nIn the near future, pet avatars are developed to work in virtual reality.

The education of a reluctant businessman (by Yvon Chouinard)\n\n_Read: January 2021_\n\nFounder of Patagonia details the beginnings of the company, how they grew and what the considerations were at all steps of the way. It's a very nicely comprehensive book of how to try to lead an as good company as possible, in terms of sustainability, work ethics, employer happiness and product quality. Also about the hurdles on the way and the problems of combining growth and production with environmental consciousness. Lots in there to aspire to, and it makes want to never work for a company that does not agree with these values. \nI didn't take as many notes as I wanted to, since I rarely had a pen nearby, but I will probably read the book again in the future. \n**Some take away messages:** Change is good, embrace it, don't stand still. It's more important to get people who share the philosophy than people who have a lot of knowledge (e.g. rather hiring a surfer to train them in accounting, than an accountant who would never ever surf). The best leadership is by example. Not buying a product in the first place is best for the environment. But if you buy one, use it as long as possible, repair it.\n\u003e If we could al come to see our customer products as tools that help us live our real lives - rather than as substitutes and surrogates for that life - we would need many fewer products to be happy. And we would keep the ones we already have for longer. (Naomi Klein) pXI\n\n\u003e When a problem comes up, the effective CEO does not immediately hire a consultant. Outsiders don't know your business the way you do, and anyway, I've found that most consultants come from a failed business. Only by confronting the problems and trying to solve them yourself will you prevent them from happening again in another form. p172\n\n\u003e New employees coming into the company with a strong culture and values may think that they shouldn't rock the boat and shouldn't challenge the status quo. On the contrary, while values should never change, every organization, business, government, or religion must be adaptive and resilient and constantly embrace new ideas and methods of operation. \n\n\u003e Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a finite planet is either a madman or an economist - Kenneth Boulding. p175\n\n\u003e I'm pessimistic because I see no will in society to do enough about the impending doom. Yet there's no difference between a pessimist who says \"It's all over, don't bother trying to do anything, forget about voting, it won't make a difference\" and an optimist who says \"Relax, everything is going to turn out fine.\". Either way the results are the same. Nothing gets done. p175\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/The-Art-of-Fermentation":{"title":"The art of fermentation","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/The-Dispossessed":{"title":"The Dispossessed","content":"\nBeautifully crafted, each sentence feels deliberate. The worlds built up are complete end imperfect (--\u003e sometimes that book gets the subtitle \"An ambiguous utopia\"). \n\n## Some quotes from the book\n\n### Chapter 1\nHe thought of death, in that gap between the beginning of a step and its completion, and at the end of the step he stood on a new earth.\n\n\n### Chapter 4\nThe economy of Anarres would not support the building, maintenance, heating, lighting of individual houses and apartments. A person whose nature was genuinely unsociable had to get away from society and look after himself. He was completely free to do so. He could build himself a house wherever he liked (though if it spoiled a good view or a fertile bit of land he might find himself under heavy pressure from his neighours to move elsewhere).\n\n\nA long time later, he was awake. He could breathe. He was perfectly well. Everything was all right. He felt disinclined to move. To move would disturb the perfect, stable moment, the balance of the world. The winter light along the ceiling was beautiful beyond expression. He lay and watched it. The old men down the ward were laughing together, old husky cackling laughs, a beautiful sound.\n\n\nEven from a brother there is no comfort in the bad hour, in the dark at the foot of the wall.\n\n\n### Chapter 5\nHe worked at the Light Research Laboratories, read a great deal, and wrote three papers that summer and autumn: a productive half year, by normal standards. But he knew that in fact he had done nothing real.\n\n\nHe tried to read an elementary economics text; it bored him past endurance, it was like listening to somebody interminably recounting a long and stupid dream. He could not force himself to understand how banks functioned and so forth, because all of the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the money changers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal. \n\n\nAnd the strangest thing about the nightmare street was that none of the millions of things for sale were made there. They were only sold there. Where were the workshops, the factories, where were the farmers, the craftsmen, the miners, the weavers, the chemists, the carvers, the dyers, the designers, the machinists, where were the hands, the people who made? Out of sight, somewhere else. Behind walls. All the people in all the shops were either buyers or sellers. They had no relation to the things but that of possession. \n\n\n\"Nobody owns anything to rob. If you want things you take them from the depository. As for violence, well, I don't know, Oiie; would you murder me, ordinarily? And if you felt like it, would a law against it stop you? Coercion is the least efficient means of obtaining order.\"\n\n\n### Chapter 6\n\"You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them. By refusing to think, refusing to change. And that's precisely what our society is doing!\"\n\n\nIn the night one of them cried out aloud, dreaming. The other one reached his arm out sleepily, muttering reassurance, and the blind warm weight of his touch outweighed all fear.\n\n\nIn a gap between eastern peaks a colorless luminosity of the sky heralded moonrise. The stream was noisy in the silence of the high, bare hills. There was no wind, no cloud. The air above the mountains was like amethyst, hard, clear, profound. \n\n\n...complex concentric shapes made of wire, which moved and changed slowly and inwardly when suspended from the ceiling. She had made these with scarp wire and tools from the craft-supply depot, and called them _Occupations of Uninhabited Space_. \n\n\nShe liked the work; it combined two things she valued: accurate, factual research and a specific goal of increase or betterment. Without such work she would not have been satisfied. \n\n\n### Chapter 7\nThe only heavy snow of the winter fell that week. Shevek had never seen a snowfall of more than an inch or so. The extravagance, the sheer quantity, of the storm exhilarated him. He reveled in its excess. It was too white, too cold, silent, and indifferent to be called excremental by the sincerest Odonian; to see it as other than an innocent magnificence would be pettiness of soul.\n\n\nHe had been fascinated from the start by the Urrasti habit of wrapping everything up in clean, fancy paper or plastic or cardboard or foil. Laundry, books, vegetables, clothes, medicines, everything came inside layers and layers of wrappings. Even packets of paper were wrapped in several layers of paper. Nothing was to touch anything else. He had begun to feel that he, too, had been carefully packaged.\n\n\nIt was the verbal mode of the Nioti, past and future rammed into one highly charged, unstable present tense. \n\n\nNio Esseia, a city of five million souls, lifted its delicate glittering towers across the green marshes of the Estuary as if it were built of mist and sunlight. As the train swung in smoothly on a long viaduct the city rose up taller, brighter, solider, until suddenly it enclosed the train entirely in the roaring darkness of an underground approach, twenty tracks together, and then released it and its passengers into the enormous, brilliant spaces of the Central Station, under the central dome of ivory and azure, said to be the largest dome ever raised on any world by the hand of man.\n\n\n### Chapter 8\nThe validity of the promise, even promise of indefinite term, was deep in the grain of Odo's thinking; though it might seem that her insistence on freedom to change would invalidate the idea of promise or vow, in fact the freedom made the promise meaningful. A promise is a direction taken, a self-limitation of choice. \n\n\n### Chapter 10\nThey walked along side by side. The autumn stars had come out, incredible in number and brilliance, twinkling and almost blinking because of the dust stirred up by the earthquake and the wind, so that the whole sky seemed to tremble, a shaking of diamond chips, a scintillation of sunlight on a black sea. Under that uneasy splendor the hills were dark and solid, the roofs hard-edged, the light of the street lamps mild.\n\n\nThe days were utterly peaceful, in the autumn sunlight, in the silence of the hills.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/The-Ministry-for-the-Future":{"title":"The Ministry for the Future","content":"\n_Read: _","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/books/Transcendent-Waves":{"title":"Transcendent Waves","content":"\n![](projects/attachments/transcendent%20waves.jpeg)\n\n### Pieces to remember\n\n\u003e Foreword by Bibbe Hansen: (...) The activity of art is to process the universe through the matrix of one's own being and then to express that experience into the world. Folks often choose not to live consciously and instead aggressively pursue activities and mind spaces that numb and mute any small voice of consciousness that might awaken their attention. Many are quite satisfied to respond to life with a series of default behaviors, opinions, and responses that have been collected and stored since childhood.\n\n\u003e By treating creativity like a daily process - like eating dinner or exercising - you will allow your mind to prepare for that time, thus making it feel more fruitful and methodical, as opposed to random and unexpected.\n\n\u003e How can you let your mind wander with purpose? _This_ is where listening can be our helpful field guide as we navigate creative endeavors.

Just put in a variable name instead of the `print` statement:\n\n1.  name = input (\"What's your name?\")\n\nSimilarly, if I want to turn the answer immediately into a different data type, I can do that together with the `input` command:\n\n`age = int(input (\"How old are you?\")`\n\nUsually, inputs are strings, so if I just write:\n\n`name = input(\"What's your name?\")`\n\nThe input value is stored as a string.\n\n### Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings\n`type()` Check the type of a variable, e.g. int, str\n`str()` Turn something into a string\n`int()` Turn something in to an integer\n`round()` Round a number to a specific number of decimal places, e.g. `round(3.5542, 2)`\n\n**F-string:** In front of a string (i.e. in front of the quotes) you type an `f`, then you can include different data types in curly brackets in the quotes. No need to doing `str()` or `int()`, etc.\n\n`print (f\"My weight is {weight} kg and my height is {height} m.\")`\n\n`variable = variable + 1` is the same as `variable += 1`\n\nSame for -=, *=, /=\n\nE.g. `variable = variable*2` is the same as `variable *=2`\n\n### Control flow and logical operators\n`if condition 1:`\n`    do A`\n`elif condition 2:`\n`    do B`\n`else: `\n`    do C`\n\n`\"Silvia\".lower()` --\u003e \"silvia\"\n`\"Silvia\".count(\"i\")` --\u003e 2\n\nUse three single quotes for writing multi-line strings:\n\n`print ('''This`\n`is a `\n`multi-`\n`line string`\n`''')``\n\n### Random module\nRandom number generation with the random module:\n\n`random.randint(1, 10) #Generates random integer between (and including) 1 and 10`\n`random.random() #Generates random float between (and including) 0 and (excluding) 1`\n\nPick a random item from a list:\n`random.choice(list_name)`\n\n_Don't try to learn every single function by heart. Instead, when you come across a new thing (e.g. a new data structure), read through the documentation to see what is possible. Then next time when you use it, you can look specific things up._\n\n**When importing modules:** \n\neither\n`import chosen_module`\n`print (chosen_module.sentence)`\n\nor\n`from chosen_module import sentence`\n`print (sentence)`\n\nor\n`import chosen_module as mod`\n`print (mod.sentence)`\n\nE.g. to import and use the Turtle class from the turtle module, either write:\n`import turtle`\n`new_turtle = turtle.Turtle()`\n\nor\n`from turtle import Turtle`\n`new_turtle = Turtle()`\n\nThe latter is useful when the class is used often and you don't want to type `turtle.Turtle()` all the time.\n\nIt's also possible to import everything from a module and use it as if it was part of the normal environment (i.e. without the module name).\n`from turtle import *`\n\nThis however can be confusing, since it's often good to know which module a function belongs to.\n\nE.g.\n`choice([1,3,4])` looks confusing out of context. But if you write `random.choice([1,3,4])` it's much clearer that it is part of the random module and that a random number is picked from this list.\n\nFor long module names, it's also possible to use aliases:\n\n`import turtle as t`\n`new_turtle = t.Turtle()`\n\n### Lists\n**Lists** store data in a specific order\n`fruits = [\"Cherry\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"]`\n\nTo access a specific entry from the list:\n`fruits[0]` or `fruits[-1]`\n\nTo add an item to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append(\"Melon\")`\n\nTo add several times to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append([\"Strawberry\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"]`\n\n`random.choice(list)`\nThis generates a random choice from a given list.\n\n`str.split()`\nSplits a string into separate components based on some defined divider, e.g. a comma.\n\n`str.split(\",\")`\nThe result will be a **list** that contains the separate components of the string.\n\nNested lists contain **lists of lists**. When addressing a specific item in a nested list, you have to first pick the right nested list, then the item in that list, e.g. the first item in the first list would be:\n`print (list([0][0])`\n\nTransform a string into a list:\n`list(string)`\n\n**in**\n\nThe **in** construct is an easy way to test if an element is contained in a collection, e.g. in a list.\n\n`list = [\"Silfa\", \"Duncan\", \"Laika\"]`\n`if \"Silfa\" in list:`\n`    print (\"yay\")`\n\n### Loops\n`letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`   print (letter)``\n\nNB: The item (here `number`) in a for loop does **NOT** count from 0 to i, but instead takes the value of the first item in the list (e.g. `\"a\"`) and takes on that value. This means, that to have some kind of **counting variable** that is first set to 0 (outside the loop) and then increases with each round inside the loop, you have to do the following:\n`count = 0`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`    print (letter)`\n`    count += 1``\nThen with each round through the loop, `count` will increase by 1, and will in the end have the same value as items in `letters`.\n\nFor loops are often used to loop through lists, but you can also loop through ranges of items that are not lists.\n\n**for loops and the** `**range()**` **function**\n\n`for number in range (a, b):`\n`    print (number)`\n_NB: a is included, b is not_\n\nThe step size can also be changed, e.g. to increase the numbers by 3, type:\n`range(1, 100, 3)`\n\n**So there are 2 types of for loops:**\ntype 1\n\n`for item in list _of_items:`\n`    #do something to each item`\n\ntype 2\n`for number in range(a,b):`\n`    #do something``\n\n**_When to use a for and when a while loop?_**\n\n**For** loops are great when you iterate over something, and you want to do something with each thing you iterate over. E.g. iterating through a list.\n\n  \n\n**While** loops are used when you just want to carry out some sort of functionality many times until a condition is met. Don't care about what number in a sequence you're in, which item in a list you're iterating through, etc.\n\nWhile loops are a bit more dangerous than for loops. In for loops you always have an upper bound, but while loops will continue running until the condition evaluates to `FALSE`. That can lead to infinite loops.\n\nA good thing to do when you don't know why you get an infinite loop, simply `print()` the condition inside the loop and check what's happening.\n\n**While loop**\nA loop that keeps on going while a condition is `TRUE`.\n\n`while something_is_true:`\n`    #do a thing, then test the condition again, etc.`\n\nOnce the condition evaluates to FALSE, the while loop is skipped.\n\nExample of how a while loop can be used:\n`count = 6`\n`while count \u003e 0:`\n      `print (\"Hello!\")`\n      `count -= 1   #this decreases the` `number of counts by one every time` `the loop runs`\n  \nWhile loops can also be used while a condition is `FALSE`. For that, use this syntax:\n\n`while not some_condition_that_is_true:`\n`    #do something`\n\nThis means the loop runs while the condition is `FALSE`, but as soon as it evaluates to `TRUE`, we drop out of the loop.\n\nA good way to **include a check in a while loop** is to set a variable to `True` (or `False`) before the while loop starts. Then set the while loop to run WHILE the `variable == True`. Inside the while loop, something makes the variable either remain `True` or switch to `False`. In case of False, the while loop will stop.\n\nA good way to **increase something or build something up in a For loop** is to set an empty string or an empty list outside of the for loop first. Then inside the for loop, in every turn something is added to the string or list, adding up to the final string or list when the for loop is finished.\n\n### Dictionaries\nDictionaries are useful if you want to associate labels with each value. Lists are better if you are storing similar data, such as a list of proces or names, where you cannot label each value.\n\n`dictionary1 = {`\n`   key1: value1,`\n`   key2: value2,`\n`   key3: value3,`\n`   }\n\nTo get a value back:\n`dictionary1[key2]`\n\nTo add an entry to the dictionary:\n`dictionary1[key4] = value4`\n\nSimilar to lists and strings, it's often useful to start with an _empty_ dictionary, and then later on add to the dictionary.\n`dic_new = {}`\n\nWhen looping through a dictionary, usually the **key** will be picked out:\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`   print (key)`\n\nIf you want to access a specific **value** in a dictionary (e.g. when looping through the dictionary):\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`    print (dictionary1[key])``\n\n**Nested dictionaries**\nThe nested dictionaries don't need to be the same size as the outer dictionaries. They can also include lists, strings, numbers, etc.\n\nLists are ordered and are accessed by the position inside the list. Dictionaries are NOT ordered.\n\nDictionaries (or lists) are like folders. They can contain values, but they can also contain other dictionaries (or lists).\n\nA **_dictionary that contains a list_** looks like this:\n\n`travel_log = {`\n`   \"France\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"],`\n`    \"Germany\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n`    }`\n\n  \nA **_dictionary that contains a dictionary_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = {`\n      `\"France\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], \"total_visits\": 12},`\n      `\"Germany\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"], \"total_visits\": 5},`\n`}`\n\nAnd a **_list that contains dictionaries_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = [`\n`{`\n`\"country\": \"France\", `\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], `\n`\"total_visits\": 12,`\n` },`\n` {`\n`\"country\": \"Germany\",`\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n` \"total_visits\": 5,`\n` },`\n` ]`\n\nTo get **values** from a dictionary, type the variable for the dictionary, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[\"name\"]`\n\nTo get the **keys** from a dictionary, you can turn the keys into a list, and then refer to an item in this list. NB: items in a list are ordered, while items in a dictionary are not!\n`keys_list = list(dictionary)`\n\nTo get **values from a dictionary of lists**, type the variable for the dictionary, the index of the entry in question, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[0][\"name\"]`\n\n#### Generate dictionary from a list\nSeveral options:\n- `dict.fromkeys()` Used to create a dictionary from a list. It accepts a list of **keys** that you want to turn into a dictionary. Optionally, you can specify a value you want to assign to every key. You cannot set individual values for each item in the dictionary. \n\tE.g. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict.fromkeys(fruits, \"In stock\")`\nIf we did not specify a value in our code, the default value for the keys in the dictionary would be `None`. \n- Dictionary comprehension: Creates a new dictionary from an existing list. You can specify different valuues for each key in the dictionary. \n\tE.g.\n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]` \n\t`fruit_dict = { fruit: \"In stock\" for fruit in fruits }\n\tThe dictionary comprehension runs through each item in the list `fruits`. We then add an item to our new dictionary for each fruit in our list. \n- `zip()` Converts (merges) two or more lists into a list of tuples. You can use the `dict()` method to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary. This way, one list can become the keys of the dictionary, and the other the values, e.g. if you have one list with fruits, and the other with the price of these fruits. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`prices = [3.5, 4.0, 2.1]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict(zip(fruits, prices))`\n\n#### Loop (iterate) over a dictionary\nDictionaries contain an `__iter__()` method that iterates over the keys. this method is automatically called when you put a dictionary into a `for` loop.\n`for key in a_dict: print (key)` \n\nIf you want access to the values, use the indexing operator `[]` with the dictionary and its keys:\n`for key in a_dict: print (a_dict[key])`  \n\nWhen you're working with dictionaries, it's likely that you'll want to work with both the keys and the values. One of the most useful ways to iterate through a dictionary is by using `.items()`, which is a method that returns a new view of the dictionaries items. It's a dynamic view, meaning that if the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. \nViews can be iterated over to yield their respective data, so you can iterate through a dictionary in Python by using the view object returned by `.items()`: \n`for item in a_dict.items(): print(item)`--\u003e returns tuples of the key-value pairs\n\n\nIf you just need to work with the keys of a dictionary, then you can use `.keys()`, which is a method that returns a new view object containing the dictionary's keys. To iterate through a dictionary by using `.keys()`, you just need to call `.keys()` in the header of a `for` loop:\n`for key in a_dict.keys(): print (key)` \nSimilarly, you can use `.values()` to iterate through values. \nBoth `.keys()` and `.values()` can be used to check if a key or value is present in a dictionary by using `in`: `\"apple\" in a_dict.values()`. \n\n#### Modifying values and keys\nYou'll need to use the original dictionary! \n\n#### Filtering items\nSometimes you'll want to create a new dictionary from an existing dictionary, that only stores the data that satisfies a given condition. You can do this with an `if` stateent inside a `for` loop:\n`a_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4}``\n`new_dict = {}`\n`for key, value in a_dict.items():`\n`if value \u003c= 2: new_dict[key] = value`\n`#new_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\", 2}` \n\n\n### Tuples\n`my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` --\u003e similar to list\n\nItems in a tuple are ordered (as in a list) and are accessed by indexing with square brackets.\n\nWhat's the difference from a list? A tuple's values can't be changed once it's created (i.e. **_immutable_**).\n\nWhen do you want to use a tuple? When creating something that shouldn't be changed or is protected from accidental change (e.g. the colour scheme of a website).\n\nWhen you want to change a tuple's values, you can convert it into a list by writing:  \n`list(my_tuple)`\nand then you can change the values as you would in a list.\n\n**Creating tuples:** \n`new_tuple = (first_item, second_item, third_item)`\n--\u003e separated by commas, and in round brackets\n\nTo access tuples, use same notation as for lists:\n`new_tuple[0] #first_item`\n\n\n## Functions\n**Functions**\nPython has built-in functions, e.g. `int()`, `range()`, `print()` or `round()`.\n\nCreating your own functions:\n`def my_function():`\n  `      content of function`\n\nTo call the function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**Functions with inputs**\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`    #Do this with something`\n`    #Then this `\n`    #And finally this with something`\n\nA function can have several parameters:\n`def my_function (param1, param2):`\n\nThis called **positional arguments**\n`def my_function (a, b, c):`\n`    #Do this with a`\n`    #then do this with b`\n`    #then this with c`\n\nIn comparison with keyword arguments the order doesn't matter. When a function is called, the name of the parameter is used, together with the argument for it:\n\n`my_function (a=1, b=2, c=3)`\n\nSince order doesn't matter, we could also write:\n\n`my_function (b=2, c=3, a=1)`\n\n**_Functions with outputs_**\n\nCan be simple or take inputs (arguments). Inside the function, the keyword `return` is used to \"transfer\" a result/output to the _outside_ of the function, so it can be used further.\n\n`def my_function():`\n`result = 2*3`\n`return result`\n\nAfter the `return` keyword, the function is exited, and anything that would come after the `return` keyword in the function will not be executed. This can be used to return the function early if needed (e.g. check with an `if` statement if some condition is true, and then just use the `return` keyword to exit out of the function).\n\n**Different types of functions:**\n  \n**_Simple functions_**\nVery simple, without any parameters. Just reduced complexity by reducing the amount of code you need to write (e.g. if there is a recurring task).\n\n`def my_function():`\n`#do this`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**_Functions with inputs_**\nFunctions with parameters take an input that gets passed into the function when the function is called. This allows us to modify what the function does, depending on what input was passed in.\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`#do this with something`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function(123)`\n\n\n**_Docstrings_**\nWith docstrings, you can include a comment or little explanation with your newly created function about what it does and what it takes as input. Docstrings must be placed in the first line of the function and have to be encased in triple quotation marks. They can run over several lines.\n\n`def some_function(a, b):`\n`\"\"\"This function takes inputs a and b and does something to them, `\n`returning something else.\"\"\"`\n\n**Keyword arguments**\nEspecially for functions you haven't written yourself, it's really useful to write keyword arguments instead of positional arguments when calling the function.\n\nWith keyword arguments, you specify which argument you are referring to.\n`def function1 (a, b, c):`\n`#some function text`\n`function1(a=13, b=44, c=0)`\n\n**Recursion** \n= calling a function inside itself\nYou can also take the output of one function call as an input for another function call. This is very useful for complex functions.\n\n**Useful functions:**\n\n`sum([list])` gives a sum of all items in the list\n`random.choice([list])` picks a random item from a list (requires to import the random package first)\n\nGlobal variables are by convention written in all caps.\n\nTo exit a function, simply use the `return` keyword.\n\n**Higher order function**\nA function that can work with other functions. E.g. it can take another function as an input and work with it inside the body of the function.\n\nWhen passing a function as an argument to another function, don't use the paranthesis at the end. E.g.\n`function_a (function_b)`\n\n\n## Debugging\n1. Describe the problem\n2. Reproduce the bug\n3. Play computer\n4. Fix the errors\n5. Print is your friend\n6. Use a debugger\n7. Take a break\n8. Ask a friend\n9. Run your code often\n10. Ask Stackoverflow\n\nTo access and change a global variable inside a local environment, e.g. a function, you have to write `global` + variable name first.\n\nFor example:\n`some_variable = 4`\n`def increase_something():`\n`global some_variable`\n`some_variable += 1``\n\n\n## Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n**OOP analogy:**\n\u003eYou come to a foreign country and don't know the language, don't know the city and don't have local money, but you want your clothes dry-cleaned. Instead of doing it yourself, you ask the hotel staff to do it, who know the language, the city and have local money.\n\n`hotel.dry_clean_clothes()`\n\n\nObjects have things they HAVE and things they DO.\nThings they HAVE = **_attributes_**\nE.g.\n`is_holding_plate = True`\n`tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]`\n\nThings they DO = **_methods_**\nMethods are functions specific for an object\nE.g.\n`def take_order(table, order):`\n`#takes order to chef`\n`def take_payment(amount):`\n`#add money to restaurant``\n\n### Classes\nClasses are _blueprints_ for objects.\nClasses are usually written in Pascal case, i.e. every word beginning is capitalized\nE.g.\n`car = CarBlueprint()`\n\nTo leave a class or function empty (for now), you can use the keyword `pass` to avoid \"indent error\" messages.\n\n#### init function\n**Constructor** = part of the class that specifies what should happen when our object is constructed (= initializing an object). Variables and counters are set to their starting values.\n\nUse special function `__init__ (self)` to initialize the attributes.\n\nThe init function is going to be called every time a new object from this class is created.\n\nIn addition to the parameter self, there can be as many parameters as you want in the brackets after __init__. These parameters get passed in when a new object is constructed. These parameters can then be used to set an object's attributes.\n\n\nTo have a default value for an attribute, instead of setting it equal to one of the parameters of the init function, set it to a value in the init function (not the parameters!).\n\ne.g.\n`def __init__ (self, user_id, username):`\n`self.user_id = user_id`\n`self.username = username`\n`self.followers = 0`\n\nThis way the new object has new_object.followers set to 0 by default.\n\nExample of init function:\n`class Car:`\n`def __init__(self, seats):`\n`self.seats = seats`\n\nThe number of seats specificied when a new object of this class is initialized gets passed to that object as an attribute.\n\n`new_car = Car(5)` --\u003e this will set the attribute new_car.seats to 5.\n\nThere can be many parameters in the init function. However, it means that whenever you create a new object from this class, you MUST provide all these pieces of information for the new object.\n\n#### Making a new class\n`class User:`\n`#add functions, etc.`\n\n`user_1 = User()` to make a new instance of the class\n\n`user_1.username = \"Silfa\"` to create a new attribute for the object. An attribute is a variable that is associated with an object.\n\nBut for attributes that all new instances should have in common, it's better to include them in the constructor.\n\n#### Methods in classes\nMethods = what the object DOES, i.e. a function that the object has.\n\nMethods can use `self.` attributes of objects.\n\nTo call the method, use the normal dot notation with brackets after the method, e.g.\n`user_1.start_game()`\n\nMethods in classes always need to have a `self` parameter as the first (and sometimes only) parameter. This means that when the method is called, it \"knows\" the object that called it.\n\n`def new_method(self):`\n`self.followers += 1`\n\nThe `self` keyword is a way to refer to the object that is being created from a class.\n\nWe can use the class name inside an object to tap into the class.\n\nFor example we can create a list of objects by initiating new instances of a class inside a loop and filling a list with these new objects. These objects have all the attributes that are defined in the class constructer, and these attributes can be accessed with dot notation.\n\n\nWhen inside a class, and calling one of the functions inside one of the other functions, you have to use `self.` before the function name.\n\nE.g.\n`def function_using_another_function(self, input, something):`\n`self.previous_function(attribute1, attribute2)`\n`...`\n\n\nDifferent **instances** of classes can have different **states**. E.g. Turty and Timmy can be different instances of the class Turtle(), and they can have different states, e.g. `turty.color = green` and `timmy.color = purple`. \n\n## Interesting modules and other things\n\n**colorgram** is a Python library that lets you extract colours from images.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/AlphaFold":{"title":"AlphaFold basics","content":"\n[What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution (Nature News)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5)\n\n[ColabFold: Making protein folding accessible to all (Nature Methods)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01488-1)\n\n\n## Original AlphaFold paper\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2\n- First computational method (neural network-based model AlphaFold) that can regularly predict protein structures from amino acid sequence alone, with atomic accuracy, even in cases in which no similar structure is known. \n- Novel machine learning approach incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure. AlphaFold network directly predicts the 3D coordinates of all heavy atoms for a given protein using the primary amino acid sequence and aligned sequences of homologues as inputs.\n- AlphaFold is trained on protein chains in the PDB released before 2018-04-30. \n- All-atom accuracy of AlphaFold in the CASP14 competition was 1.5 Å (1.4 Å is the width of a carbon atom). \n\nThe AlphaFold pipeline:\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023095944.png)\n\n- **Confidence measure = pLDDT**(predicted local-distance difference test).\n- Limitations: Model uses MSAs and the accuracy decreases substantially when the median alignment depth is less than around 30 sequences. AlphaFold is also much weaker for proteins that have few intra-chain or homotypic contacts compared to the number of heterotypic contacts; this occurs typically for bridging domains within larger complexes in which the shape of the protein is created almost entirely by interactions with other chains in the complex. \n\n## AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\nhttps://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/\n\n- **Search**: search for queries based on protein name, gene name, UniProt accession or organism name. (Currently no BLAST/sequence-based searching supported, but you can use hte EBI Protein Similarity Search tool to seach AlphaFold DB based on a query sequence)\n- Currently (as of July 2022) includes most of UniProt 2021_04 release, as well as proteomes of 20 model organisms and 48 complete proteomes. That means in total almost 215 Mio structures. Sequences that are not covered include ones that contain non-standard aas, are \u003c16 aas or \u003e2700 aas, and viral proteins. If your sequences aren't included you can generate your own AlphaFold predicitions using DeepMind's [AlphaFold Colab notebook](projects/coding/AlphaFold.md#AlphaFold%20Colab%20notebook). \n\n### Example of structure page\n\n#### General structure and confidence\n3D viewer: shows overall structure and confidence (pLDDT score; 100 = best, 0 = worst) in different parts of the structure. pLDDT \u003e 90 are suitable for applications that require high accuracy, e.g. characterising binding sites. pLDDT \u003c 70 should be treated with caution, and pLDDT \u003c 50 should not be interpreted (shown as only a ribbon-like structure); these regions are often either unstructured in physiological conditions or only structured as part of a complex. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023102704.png)\n\nClick on aas in the sequence to zoom in and see side chains:\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023102819.png)\n\nNB: PDB and mmCIF files that are downloadable contain coordinates for all regions, regardless of pLDDT score! It's up to the user to interpret the model judiciously . \n\n\n#### Relative position of domains\nPredicted alignment error (PAE) is necessary to assess the confidence in the domain packing and large-scale topology of the protein:\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221023103017.png)\n\nColour at (x, y) indicates AlphaFold's expected position error at residue x if the predicted and true structures were aligned on residue y. Low = good. If the PAE is high for residue pairs x, y from two different domains, then the relative positions and/or orientations of these domains in the 3D structure are uncertain and should not be interpreted. \n\nPAE info can be downloaded as JSON file.\n\n### What AlphaFold does not support (yet)\n- Intrinsically disordered or unstructured regions\n- Effects of mutations. In particular, AlphaFold is not expected to produce an unfolded protein structure given a sequence containing a destabilising point mutation. \n- Multiple conformations of a protein. AlphaFold usually only produces one of them. \n- Predictions of positions of any non-protein components (e.g. cofactors, ligans, ions, post-translational modifications, DNA/RNA, metals, etc.). However, coordinates are often consistent with the expected structure in the presence of ions or cofactors. \n\n\n### Citing  \u0026 Licence\nIf you use an AlphaFold DB prediction in your work, please cite the following papers:  \n  \n[Jumper, J _et al_.

Course overview + the shell \nhttps://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/\n\n`~` is short for _home_\nType `date` to print (display) the current date and time. \n\n`echo`... Print commands with arguments, e.g. `echo \"Hello Silfa\"` --\u003e prints \"Hello Silfa\" on the screen.\n\n`echo $PATH` --\u003e Prints the directories the should should search for when given a command. \n\nWe can find out which file is executed for a given program using the `which` command, e.g. `which echo` shows where the file for the echo command is located (in my case, it results in \"shell built-in command\").\n\n#### Navigating the shell\nPath directories are separated by `/` on Linux and macOS and `\\` on Windows. \n\nA path that starts with `/` is called an _absolute_ path. Any other path is a _relative_ path (i.e. relative to the current working directory).\n\n`pwd` ... print working directory\n\n`cd` ... change directory \n\n`ls` ... shows list of current directory. With `-l`, list files in long format, i.e. with permissions.\n\n`mv` ... move/rename a file\n\n`cp` ... copy a file\n\n`mkdir`... make a new directory\n\nIn a path, `.` refers to the current directory, and `..` to its parent directory. So `cd ..` moves you \"downwards\" a level of directories.\n\nMost commands accept flags and options (i.e. flags with values) that start with `-` to modify their behaviour. \n\n`--help` or `-h` in addition to command name will print some help text, e.g. `ls --help`. \n\nFile permissions: list with `ls -l`\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221009103057.png)\nd = \"missing\" is a directory.\n\nFirst block of 3 characters: owner of the file; then users; then everyone else. So, `rwx` = read, write and execute (search) access; `r-x` = only read and execute access. \n\nIf you want more information about a command's or program's arguments, inputs, outputs, or how it works in general, try the `man` (= manual) program, e.g. `man ls`. \n\n**In terminal, press q for quit!**\n\n#### Connecting programs\nInput stream \u003c program \u003e output stream\n\nUsually the input and output streams are the terminal, but that can be rewired.\n\n`echo hello \u003e hello.txt` creates a text file containing the word _hello_. \n\n`cat hello.txt` prints the contents of the hello.txt file to the screen. `cat` concetenates and prints files (usually to the standard output, unless otherwise stated). \n\n`cat \u003c hello.txt \u003e hello2.txt` prints the content of the hello.txt file (input, `cat \u003c hello.txt`) to the hello2.txt file (output; `\u003e hello2.txt`). \n\nYou can also use `\u003e\u003e` to append to a file. The pipe operator `|` lets you \"chain\" programs such that the output of one is the input of another:\n\n#### Root user\nRoot user is above (almost) all access restrictions and can create, read, update and delete any file in the system. It's very easy to accidentally break something as the root user, so you will not usually log into your system as root user. Instead, you will be using the `sudo` command. It lets you do (`do`) something as superuser (`su`). _But make sure you double-check that you really want to do it that way!!_\n\nWhen you get permission denied errors, it's usually because you need to do someting as root.\n\n#### More commands\n\n`touch` ... Change file access and modification times. If file does not exist, it is created with default permissions. \n\n`chmod` ... Change file modes or access control lists.\n\n`curl` ... Enables data transfer over various network protocols, suchas ftp, http, https, pop3, etc. It communicates with a web or application server by specifying a relevant URL and the data that needs to be sent or received. `--head` fetches the header only. `--silent` Silent or quiet mode that won't show progress meter or error messages.\n\n`date` ... Display or set date and time. If combined with `-r` and a filename, the date and time of the last modification of filename is returned.\n\n##### Exercises\n1. Check that you're running an appropriate shell: `echo $SHELL` --\u003e `/bin/zsh`, so everything looks good. \n2. Create a new directory called \"Missing Semester\": `mkdir \"Missing Semster\"`\n3. Use `touch` to create a new file called \"semester\": `touch semester`\n4. Write the following (line by line) into the file semester: \n```\n#!/bin/sh\ncurl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu\n```\n Use single quotes for the first line!! # starts a comand in Bash, and ! has a special meaning, even with double quotes.\n5. `echo '#!/bin/sh' \u003e semester`\n6. `'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' \u003e semester`\n7. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script: `./semester`. Permission denied. Why? --\u003e `ls -l` shows `-rw-r--r--@`, i.e. I don't have executing access. \n8. Run the command by explicitely starting the `sh` interpreter and giving it the file semester as the first argument: `sh semester`. \n\nWhy does this work, but `./semester` didn't?\n_sh is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. I already have permission to execute sh, so it can run the semester script without problems. On the other hand, I don't have rights to execute the semester script directly._\n\n9. Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than having to type `sh semester`.\nChange the executing rights with `chmod +x semester.sh`. \n\n11. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? \n\n_The purpose of the shebang (`#!`) line is to tell the operating system (or whatever process launches the interpreter) what to use as the interpreter. _\n\n11. Use `|` and `\u003e` to write the \"last modified\" date output by semester into a file called last-modified.txt. \n```\ndate -r semester \u003e last modified.txt\ncat last-modified.txt \n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Genart-ideas":{"title":"Genart ideas","content":"\n## Starry night mountains\n\n![](projects/attachments/Starry%20Nights%20patch.png)\nfrom https://www.etsy.com/se-en/listing/633985377/starry-night-mountain-patch-geometric?ref=shop_home_active_186\u0026crt=1\n\nRandomly placed points, connected to their nearest neightbours with dashed line, but only to their below neighbours. \n\n\n\n## Generative art stitching\n- Turn a genart piece into instructions for cross stitching (by pixellating and assigning colours)\n- Input/scan the colours of threads you have in your stash to limit the art piece to those colours --\u003e generate a pattern with only those colours.\n- Input desired size of piece to match with what you want to get in the real world.\n- With sliders: select style of art, degree of distortion, etc. \n- Include real data as input: e.g. real numbers instead of random as seed or real dataset that's loaded in and then interpreted.\n- Spits out an instruction template with the chosen colours (e.g. turn colours into letters, yellow = y, light green = lg, etc. for easy print-out).\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Genart-inspo":{"title":"Genart inspo","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Modules":{"title":"JS Modules","content":"\n## Modules\nA module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides for other modules to use, i.e. is visible to other modules (its _interface_). The interface are the connection points between different modules; there's some _internal_ stuff going on inside the module, and some _public_ stuff that is shared with other modules. \n\nSee also: [[JS Packages]], [[JS npm]]\n\nWhy modules:\n- To not have to code everything from scratch if you want to use something repeatedly. \n- To manage complexity.\n- To have a \"LEGO\" system of code pieces that can interact through well-defined connectors. \n\nThe relations between modules are called _dependencies_ (i.e. a module _depends_ on another module). Dependencies are the other modules that a module makes use of.\n\n_Think about how to structure your code and what should maybe go into modules after you have done most of the coding, not during. _\n\nIf we want to make dependency relations part of the code, we'll have to take control of **loading dependencies**. Doing that requires being able to execute strings as code. \nFor that, we use the `Function` constructor. It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names, and a string containing the function body. \n\n```\nlet plusOne = Function(\"n\", \"return n+1;\");\nconsole.log(plusOne(4));\n// 5\n```\n\n\n**`require`**\nWhen you call this function with the module name of a dependency, the module is loaded and returns its interface. Modules automatically get their own local scope. All they have to do is call `require` to access their dependencies and put their interface in the object boud to `exports`.\n\nUsually modules have their dependencies on the top, e.g.\n```\nconst ordinal = require(\"ordinal\");\n```\nCalling `require` involves reading the module's code, wrapping it in a function and calling it. \nIt's usually written as a filepath, e.g. `\"./format-date\"` (i.e. the file `format-date.js` in the same directory). \n\n**`exports`**\nThe module adds its interface function to `exports` so that modules that depend on it get access to it, e.g. \n```\nexports.formatDate = function(date, format) {......};\n``` \n\n**`module`**\n\n## ECMAscript modules\nSince 2015, there's a new standard, that's however slow to be widely adopted. It uses **`import`** instead of `require` to acess a dependency, and **`export`** instead of `exports` to export things. \n```\nimport ordinal from \"ordinal\";\n\nexport funciton formatDate(date, format) {......}\n```\n\nIt's possible to rename imported bindings using the word **`as`**:\n`import {days as dayNames} from \"date-names\"; `\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing your own modules, find out what data structures people are usually using and follow their example, if possible. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.223162624Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Packages":{"title":"JS Packages","content":"\n## Packages\n\n_Packages_ enable you to build a program out of separate pieces or run these pieces on their own, and also apply the same pieces in different programs. \nA _package_ is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed) on its own.

Create an .html file, specifying in the `\u003chead\u003e`: `\u003clink href=\"CSS/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\u003e`\n2. Create the `style.css` file and specify the style of various parts of the html document. \n3. To show both windows (html + css) next to each other in Visual Studio Code, right click on one of the files in the Explorer section and select Open to the side.\n\n__To run the website in your browser (from Visual Studio Code), click Terminal \u003e New terminal and then type live-server into the terminal. Then the webpage will show up in the browser and changes will be updated (when saved in VS).__\n\nTo refer to specific parts of the document, just type the part, followed by curly brackets, e.g. \n\t`body { font-size: 3rem;`\n\t\t\t\t`background: green; `\n\t\t\t\t`\n\nYou can refer to `img` (e.g. specifying borders around images), `h1` (to change the style of all H1 headers), `a` (to change the style of all links), etc. \n\nIf there are several segments with the same style, you can group them together, e.g. \n`h2, h3 {....}`\n\n\n### Classes\n\nTo further specify a style for certain selected parts of the website, create a class in the stylesheet:\n`.someclass { (some css style)}`\nand then in the .html file, add the following tag to the part of the code you want to apply that style on, e.g. a certain paragraph only. \n`\u003cp class=\"someclass\"\u003e ...... \u003c/p\u003e`\n\nClasses can be used several times in a document. You can use more than one class per html tag. \n\n\n### Pseudo-classes and links\nPseudo classes often start with a colon.\n\n`a:link` --\u003e unvisited links of a webpage\n`a:visited`--\u003e style for visited links\n`a:focus` --\u003e the currently \"focused\" (selected) element\n`a:hover` --\u003e state of link when hovered over\nThese pseudo classes (if used) must go in the order listed!  L - V - F - H\n\nIt's very nice, for example, to change the background colour of the link or make the text go bold when hovered over. \n\nTo use **classes** for specific links (e.g. a class \"bigandbold\", in the stylsheet write:\n`a.bigandbold { .... }` `\nand in the .html file write add the class tag to the relevant `\u003ca href.... \u003e`:\n`\u003ca href=\".....\" class=\"bigandbold\"\u003e....`\n\n_NB: Here, it's just a **.** whereas in the pseudo classes referring to all links in general, it was a **:**_\n\nClasses and pseudoclasses can also be grouped together (with other segments) if they should have the same style, e.g.:\n\n`h2, h3, .bigandbold, a:link { .... }` \nNB: separated by **comma**!\nSo the style is applied to all of these elements!\n\n### Targeting things more specifically\nChain the \"location\" together with spaces in between. = descendant selector.\nE.g. all unvisited links located inside an unordered list:\n`ul a:link { .....}`\nNB: separated by **space**!\nSo the styling is only applied to the a:link of the unsorted list.\n\n### IDs\nSimliar to classes, but can be used only once per page.\nIDs start with #:\n`#smallanditalics { .... }` \n\nIDs are very specific, overriding styles from elements and classes. \nIDs are not very common in CSS nowadays, but very common in Javascript.\n\n\n### Using a different font than what is by default offered in css\n\nFind a font on Google Font, e.g. Crimson Text.\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text\n\nClick on the little + sign next to the example text, e.g. for Regular.\nIn the \"Use on the web\" box, select \"@import\", then copy the text in between the `\u003cstyle\u003e... \u003c/style\u003e` tags.\n\nPaste this text at the very top of your css stylesheet.\n\nThen, when selecting a font-family, select \"Crimson Text\". \n\n\n### The Box model\n![](projects/attachments/Screenshot%202022-07-30%20at%2016.07.54.png)\n\n#### \u003c div\u003e\nMakes a box. (div = division)\n\nIt's often very useful to draw borders around elements (divs, paragraphs, headings, etc.) to figure out if the distance between them is caused by padding or by margins.\n\n`p { border: 2px black solid; }`\n\n#### margin\nMargin values can be negative or positive. Negative margins makes divs overlap.\n`margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left`\n\n#### border\nBorder around the div.\n`border-width, border-style, border-color, border-top, border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc.`\n\n#### Example of how to use divs\n`\u003cdiv class = \"box1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome text, blalbabllablab \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`\n\nAnd then in the css style sheet, the style of the .box1 class can be specified, e.g.:\n\n`.box1 {width: 25%;`\n\t\t\t`border: 2px solid black;`\n\t\t\t`background-color: green;`\n\t`}`\n\n\n#### block vs. inline elements\nBlock elements stretch across whole screen. \nInline elements are only as wide as their content (e.g. images, links, strong text, emphasised text).\n\nIn inline elements, you can only add *padding* to either side, not on top and bottom! \n\n##### How to change an inline element to a block element\nWhen I have a link (in-line element) and I want it to be bigger, e.g. filling out a whole box that is clickable.\n\n`a {display: block;}`\n\n\n#### Navigation bars\nUser `\u003cnav\u003e` html tag and fill it with an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e`) of links. To access only the links in that nav bar in the css style sheet (to e.g. specify a hover state), use :\n`nav a:hover {....}` \n\n##### Example of creating a navigational bar with clickable buttons\n\n1. In .html, make an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca....\u003e`) inside a `\u003cnav\u003e` tag with the links that you want in the navigation bar.\n2. In .css, change the font, e.g. `body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}`\n3. To access the list of navigation bar elements, type inside of `nav ul {...}`. \n4. To remove the points in front of unordered list items: `list-style-type: None`\n5. Good idea to clean up (i.e. remove) unnecessary margins and padding from some elements: `nav ul {padding: 0; margin: 0;}`\n6. Reduce the width of the box containing the links, i.e. the `\u003cli\u003e` element: `nav li {width: 8rem;}`\n7. Give the box a background colour to make it more visible: `nav li {background-color: lightblue;}`\n8. Center the link text inside the box: `nav li {text-align: center;}`\n9. Remove underlines of links: `nav a {text-decoration: none;}`\n10. More space between the buttons: `nav li {margin-bottom: 0.5rem;}`\n11. Change the hover state of the link: `nav a:hover {background-color: blue; color: lightblue;}`\n12. To make the link clickable area as big as the box that contains it, the link has to be changed from an inline element to a block element: `nav a {display: block;}`\n13. To make the vertical list of link buttons into a horizontal list: `nav li {display: inline-block;}`\n\n#### Floats\nUseful when text should flow around an image nicely.\n\nMake a class that you apply to the picture that defines that the image should be on the left and text should float around it:\n`.floatleft {float: left;}`\n\n### Shorthand for margins/padding\nInstead of specifying `margin-left`, `margin-top`, etc. use the **TRBL** shorthand:\n`margin: 2rem 1% 2px 0;`\nCan have mixed units.\n\n### Flexbox\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/hugo_basics":{"title":"Hugo basics","content":"\n## Front matter\nMarkdown files need front matter:\n`---\n`title: \"Some blog post\"`\n`date: 2022-07-30T09:01:05+01:00`\n`draft: false`  --\u003e if false, will not be published yet\n`---`\n\nOther things that can go into the front matter:\n**Cover image**\n`cover:`\n\t`image: img/somepic.jpg`\n\t`alt: \"This is alt text\"`\n\t`caption: \"This is the image caption\"`\n\n## Configuration file\nRead theme documentation to know exactly what can be changed in the config.yaml file.\n\nE.g. menu for \"Categories\" displayed (in PaperMod theme):\n\n`menu:\n\t`main:\n\t\t`identifier: categories`\n\t\t`name: Categories`\n\t\t`url: /categories/`\n\t\t`weight: 10`\n\n\nThen in the front matter of the \"Categories\" main .md page, add `layout: \"categories\"`  --\u003e this only works if there is a categories.html template in the chosen theme (e.g. under static\u003ethemes\u003ePaperMod\u003elayouts)\n`url: \"/categories/\"`\n`summary: categories`\nto the front matter below `title`.  \n\n\n## Theme overwrites\nNot recommended to directly update in the theme's files itself, otherwise the changes are lost when the theme is updated.\nBetter: make a local copy of the file that you want to change (e.g. archives.html). \nGo to your layouts folder and recreate the exact folder structure from your theme, leading to the archives.html file. \n\nThen whatever changes are done in _that_ file will overtake the settings in the original archives.html file. \n\n## Adding tags and categories to posts\n_Theme-specific!

Best mixed with other \"softer\" legumes, like Toor dal or soy bean. \n- Same with \"tough\" lentils (e.g. Gotland lentils): they don't make a good cake on their own, but are a good addition to other legumes that would give a too soft cake.\n- Fava beans give a starchy/meaty, but quite soft texture. Would benefit from mixing with something tougher (e.g. Gotland lentils).\n- Quinoa gives a very dense and chewy texture. Grows VERY quickly and overheats very easily! \n- Toor dal can get quite chewy and meat-like, especially when it's boiled and fried after fermentation. \n\n## Fermentation\n- Rather slightly too cold (29 ºC) than too warm (\u003e35 ºC). \n- It's good to test a new batch of starter culture first, to see how active it is. But generally using a bit less starter and incubating for longer at not too high temperature gives the best tempeh. Adding a lot of starter culture results in too rapid fermentation --\u003e too much heat development --\u003e overripe (ammonia) taste and black sporulation spots.\n- Adding salt to the bean cooking water improves the taste only a tiny bit. It's not really worth adding it, and it might slow down fungal growth. It's better to simmer in soy-water afterwards, or marinate. \n- Good sized bags are e.g. Zip bag 16x12cm, PE-LD (ordered from Fyndiq). Fill with about 200-250 g of cooked beans for nice-sized block. Not more, otherwise it gets too thick and develops too much internal heat during mycelium growth.\n\n\n## Cooking\n- When boiling in salt water, **boil for 4-5 min total**, otherwise it gets too soggy and the legumes get too cooked.\n\n## Storing\n- Do not store for more than 2 days in the fridge without prior heat treatment (see below)! It continues fermenting and will start to taste very funky.\n\n## What has worked best so far\n### Fermentation\nFor all legumes: \n- Add **4 Tbsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) apple cider vinegar after cooking, then let dry a bit, e.g. in a **50C** oven for **30-60 min** with occasional stirring. \n- Mix with **1-2tsp/kg** (dry weight of legumes) tempeh starter. \n- Fill into plastic bags or glass dishes, nicely compact. For plastic bags, poke holes with a wooden skewer every few centimers. \n- Cover with a clean tea towel and place in the oven onto a heating mat, place the temperature sensor into one of the cakes and set the thermostat to 30C. Close the oven door and just leave it without turning on the oven. Observe the temperature and when it goes over 32C, turn off the heating pad (for a while). If it continues to go up, remove the tea towel, or even take the cakes out of the oven. It really shouldn't be much warmer than 32C for a long time, otherwise it tastes too fermented. Ideal is **30C**. \n- If it looks done after less than 24h or if it starts to get black sporulation spots, place it in the fridge for 1-2 days for slow continued growth. \n\nGenerally, after **30-40h** the cakes are sufficiently densly permeated with mycelium to hold together when cut and marinated. Much earlier than that, and it's a crumbly bean mess that tastes more like just cooked beans than tempeh. Much longer than that and it can get very squidgy and have a very fermented, funky taste (which some people like, but I don't). \n\nIdeal time plan:\n- Soak beans over night.\n- Cook beans in the afternoon, dry and let cool down. \n- Inoculate early evening, place on heating mat/in oven. During the first 12h there's little risk of overheating, so no observation necessary. \n- During the next day, occasionally check the thermometer or touch the cakes. If temperature gets too high, place them in a cooler place to \"calm down\" the fermentation. \n- In the evening of day 2, either place the cake in the fridge if it is nice and dense. If it still looks a bit loose, just leave it on the countertop over night and place it in the fridge the next day. \n- Proceed with heat treatment, cooking it right away, or placing it in the freezer. \n\n### Substrates\n#### Soy beans\n250 g, rinse and soak o/n. Try to remove as much skin as possible from the beans by pressing them through your hands. Doesn't need to be 100%, but good if about half of the beans  lose their skin. Cook for **50 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Nice on its own or mixed with other legumes. _Soy beans increase in weight about 2X during cooking._\n\n#### Black beans\n250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation (this definitely helps with growth!). Don't bother chopping in food processor or dehulling. Best to mix 1:1 or 3:2 with a legume with thinner skin, e.g. Toor dal. _Black beans increase in weight about 1.8X during cooking._\n\n#### Toor dal\n125 g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Drain and let steam off. Add vinegar, mix, let dry. Best to mix 1:1 or 2:3 with a legume with thicker skin, e.g. black beans, since Toor dal on its own ferments SUPER fast and often over-ferments. \n\n#### Grey peas\nDid not work at all [Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Fava%20beans%20with%20salt,%20grey%20peas%20(2020-11-24)), they have a too tough skin. Need to be dehulled and/or split. \n\n#### Fava beans\nSoak o/n, cook for **2.5 min**. Nice, slightly chewy tempeh [Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Fava%20beans%20with%20salt,%20grey%20peas%20(2020-11-24))]. Need VERY little cooking. _Fava beans increase in weight about 1.7X during cooking._\n\n#### Adzuki beans\nSoak o/n, cook for **8 min** without dehulling. Lose most of the pretty red colour during cooking. Increase in weight about 1.8X during cooking. Does not work well on its own (doesn't stick together). Needs some softer legume mixed in (e.g. Toor dal, Fava bean, soy bean). \n\n\n\n### Post-fermentation\nWhen placed in the oven, it continues to ferment and change in taste and texture. So for slightly under-fermented cakes that's a good think to do for 1-2 days. For well-fermented cakes however, I wouldn't store it in the fridge without heat-treating (and inactivating, i.e. killing) the fungus. \n\n#### Heat treatment\nRemove the tempeh cake from the plastic bag or glass dish and wrap in aluminium foil. Place in **85°C oven for 30 min**, then let cool down on the counter top. After this, the tempeh is good in the fridge for about 1-2 weeks.\n\nAlso possible (if right plastic bags are chosen) to heat-treat in the bag. E.g. LD-PE has a melting point of \u003e105°C. Wrap in aluminium foil (to prevent loss of moisture) and leave in **85°C oven for 45-60 min**. The tempeh block shrinks a bit inside the plastic bag.\n\n#### Freezing\nVery conveniently, the finished cakes can just be thrown into the freezer for long-term storage and thawed whenever you want to eat it. Best is to place it in the fridge on the day before consumption and let it thaw slowly. It's also very convenient to add marinade to the frozen cake and let it marinate and thaw at the same time in the fridge over night. \n\n\n## Gifting tempeh\nA nice way to give tempeh blocks to other people is to wrap them into baking paper or sandwich paper as an outer layer (blocks still inside the plastic bag). \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106142018.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Brussel-sprouts-with-garlic-and-pepper-corns":{"title":"Brussel sprouts with garlic and pepper corns","content":"\nRecipe: **[Brussel sprouts with garlic and pepper corns](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Brussel%20sprouts%20with%20garlic%20and%20pepper%20corns)**\n\nMade: _2022-10-26_\n\n![](projects/attachments/Fermented%20brussel%20sprouts%2001.png)\n\n_Tasted 2022-10-31 (5 days)__: Light cloudiness visible in the jar.

Depending on type of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in addition CO2, acetic acid, diacetyl, acetaldehyate, ethanol and other substances can also be formed --\u003e gives the final product its distinct taste. \n- For production of fermented milk products, the best possible growth conditions must be created for the starter culture: \n\t- Heat treatment to destroy competing microorganisms\n\t- Hold milk at optimum temperature for the relevant starter cutlure. \n\t- Cool product quickly once best flavour has been achieved. \n- In today's industrial production, milk solid (milk solid no fat - MSNF) content is usually adjusted. \n\n### Yogurt\n- Depending on region, can be highly viscous liquid, soft gel, or drink. \n\t- Set-type: Incubated and cooled in package.\n\t- Stirred type: Incubated in tanks, cooled, packaged. \n\t- Drinking type: Similar to stirred type, but coagulum is broken down to liquid before packing.\n\t- Concentrated/strained: Incubated in tanks, concentrated (i.e. whey removed), packaged.\n- Volatile aromatic substances include acetic acid and acetaldehyde.\n- May have a fat content of 0-10%, most typical is 0.5-3.5%. \n\n#### Milk standardization\nDry matter (DM) content is standardized by:\n- Evaporation\n- Addition of skim milk or protein powder\n- Addition of milk concentration\n- Ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis\n\n#### De-aeration\nAir content should be as low as possible (LAB are facultative anaerobic). In addition de-aeration improves stability, removes off flavours and reduces risk of fouling during heat treatment. \n\n#### Homogenization\nGenerally done at 20-25 MPA and 65-70C. Improves viscosity of final product and prevents creaming. \n\n#### Heat treatment\nBefore inoculation, usually 90-95C for 5 min. Denatures about 70-80% of the whey proteins (mainly beta-lactoglobulin), which then interacts with the kappa-casein to form a stable body. \n\n#### Choice of culture\nDifferent mouth thickness, gel firmness, acidity, fermentation time, post acidification. \n\nIn industrial dairy yogurt production, fermentation time is 4-5 hours at 42-43C, and pH will reach 4.2-4.5 in the end.  Then cooling to below 20C to stop fermentation. \n\n\n\n## Recipes\n\n### Kishk\nhttps://www.196flavors.com/kishk/\n\nMakes 400g:\n\n-   1 cup coarse bulgur (khichin)\n-   2½ cups thick yogurt (labné)\n-   2 teaspoons salt\n\n1.

Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. `Could use less soaking or less cooking time.` Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.\n- Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix. Add 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) tempeh starter (_topcultures_). Spread in perforated plastic bags, incubate in cupboard above freezer. \n- Growth: Passive warming, not controlled. Start 09-09-2020, 12:00 (27°C).\n\t- Toor dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total inucubation time: **44h**.\n\t- Chana dal: Total incubation time (in cupboard): **44h**.\n\t- Green mung dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total incubation time: **48h**.\n\n### Chana dal\nSlower to colonise than the others, so left in cupboard for much longer. More and bigger holes made, because it was wet inside the plastic bag. `Needs to be dried off better!` Nice dense, fluffy mycelium, no spores. Slightly sour and damp smell.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133616.png]]\n\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133323.png]]\n\n### Toor dal\nGood colonisation, got warm quickly (32°C). At the end, a bit wet and slightly yeasty, alcoholic smell. More mycelium on the sides than in the middle, but nicely colonised through and through. Tiny spores in one corner.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133655.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133718.png]]\n\n### Green mung dal\nGood initial colonisation, taken out after 23h at 34°C. Mycelium took longer to get dense. At the end, very strong, sharp alcoholic smell. Not well grown in the middle. No spores visible. Doesn't smell pleasant at all. `Too small grains! It gets too dense and wet. Mix with something bigger.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133913.png]]\n\n\n## Different Swedish legumes/grains (2020-09-19)\n\n_Test: Gula ärtor (yellow peas), Gotland linser (lentils from Gotland), Lins Anicia (lentil Anicia), Favabönor (fava beans, dehulled), bruna bönor (brown beans), vit quinoa (white quinoa), compare to Toor dal._\n\n- Material: **Legumes** from FRAM, Gothenburg. **125 g dry legumes/grains** each.\n- Soaking and cooking (until al dente):\n\t1. Yellow peas: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. Nice texture, grassy taste. Dehulling was a pain and there were weird peas that didn't get soft (~1%).\n\t2. Gotland lentils: **No soaking**. Cook for **12 min**. Nicely separated. Very good, fresh, chestnutty taste.\n\t3. Lentil Anicia: **No soaking**. Cook for **5 min**. Slightly tougher than Gotland linser, but also pleasant nutty taste.\n\t4. Fava beans: **Soak over night**, cook for **5 min**. Starchy, not a strong bean taste.\n\t5. Brown beans: **Soak over night**, dehull, boil for **18 min** `—\u003e much too long! Very mushy!` Starchy, clean taste. Dehulling was a pain, quite tough shell.\n\t6. White quinoa: **No soaking**. Rinse very thoroughly and cook for **9 min** in a lot of water. Fluffy and nice pop, slightly bitter, earthy taste, very voluminous.\n\t7. Toor dal: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219200730.png)\n\n- Inoculation: Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and heat up in dry pan to remove moisture. Spread on clean tea towel and let dry a bit. Mix in a tub thoroughly with 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) starter (_topcultures_). \n- Growth: \n\t- Open: Prepare 7 portions in plastic or glass jars for open incubation in sous vide immersion water bath, set to **32°C** water temperature (=\"open\"). Incubation start, 19-09-2020, 21:00. Sous vide immersion cooker is very loud, but temperature in water bath was very even. Water bath shut off 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\t- Plastic: Prepare 7 bigger portions in perforated plastic bags for incubation above freezer (27°C at the start) (=\"plastic\"). In the cupboard the temperature was varied, but once the mycelium started to take over it got VERY warm in some samples (35-43°C!!). Bags put at room temperature 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\n### Results\n1. **Yellow peas**: Smell is quite mild, slightly mushroomy. Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans `—\u003e maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?` Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528094941.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095009.png]]\n\n2. **Gotland lentils**: Open: Very fluffy on the top and a tiny bit sporulation. Black colour is visible underneath, but that's from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling `—\u003e mix lentils with something else!` Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095038.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095058.png]]\n\n3. **Lentils Anicia**: Didn't develop mycelium at all, neither in bag nor in cup, and also not after \u003e 48h incubation. Discarded. `—\u003e Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?`\n\n4. **Fava beans**: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy `—\u003e dry the beans better next time and cook less!` Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets `—\u003e press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.` Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095210.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095234.png]]\n\n5. **Brown beans**: Plastic: Nice very white, dense block. Slight ammonia smell! Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095320.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095914.png]]\n\n6. **White quinoa**: Got the hottest and developed mycelium the fastest. The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It's sticky and slimy —\u003e remove! `—\u003e Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.` The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top `—\u003e incubate for a shorter time!` Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag `—\u003e Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095423.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095440.png]]\n\n7. **Toor dal**: Plastic. Very nice dense cake with thick, smooth, white mycelium all around. Open: Fluffy top with slight sporulation, otherwise similar density to plastic. Both: Smells of almost nothing, very mild. Nice mycelium throughout, no wet or non-grown spots. Perfect tempeh.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095558.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095616.png]]\n\n### Cooking\nSee [Boil in soy-water](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20cooking%20methods.md#Boil%20in%20soy-water)\n\n\n## Fava beans + additions (2020-09-30)\n_Test: Addition of things that give more texture to Fava bean tempeh: Sunflower seeds, sesame seeds._\n\nRecipe from [tempeh.info](http://tempeh.info): Soy+sunflower seeds: normal soy tempeh, but substitute 100-200 g of beans with sunflower seeds. No soaking, just add them at the start of the bean cooking process. Soy + sesame: Roast 50 g sesame seeds until brown. Mix with cooled, cooked beans.\n\n- Material: 220 g dry **favabeans**.\n- Soaking and cooking: **No soaking,** cook for **20 min** until al dente (377 g after cooking). \n- Inoculation: Steam out, add 1 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and after cooling 1/2 tsp _Topcultures_ starter (**2 tsp/kg**).\n\n- Material: 40 g dry **Gotland lentils**.\n- Soaking and cooking: **No soaking**, cook for **12 min** (72 g after cooking).\n\n- Material: 36 g dry **sunflower seeds**.\n- Soaking and cooking: **No soaking**, cook for **5 min** (49 g after cooking).\n\n- Material: 29 g (3 Tbsp) toasted **white sesame seeds**\n\n### Combinations\n1. 125 g cooked fava beans + 29 g toasted sesame seeds.\n2. 125 g cooked fava beans + 49 g cooked sunflower seeds\n3. 125 g cooked fava beans + 72 g cooked Gotland lentils\n\nMix well, fill into take away tubs, press a bit down (cakes are not very high, maybe 1-2 cm), but lid on loosely, incubate above the fridge. Not very warm up there, around 27°C (18:00).\n\nNB: The sesame seed mix developed immediately a very strong sulfurous smell (poopy). That dissipated after a few hours of incubation.\n\n**24h**: Not very colonised yet, leave in cupboard. Condensation on underside of lid.\n\n**37h**: Tubs feel very warm on the underside, so take out of cupboard and leave on kitchen table at RT. Starting to get nicely colonised. Bumpy uneven surface because of big beans. Flip the cakes to get a more even surface and avoid too much fluffy mycelium on the top. The underside is a bit wet from condensation in the tub.\n\n**63h**. Harvest. The sesame mix has slightly started to sporulate in the corner. Nicely colonised, but not super dense mycelium. The beans and seeds are very dense. Sesame seeds are very much collected on the bottom of the tub. Smell is good for all of them, nothing unpleasant or alcoholic.\n\n1. Fava beans + Toasted sesame seeds: Slightly bitter. Sesame taste comes through a little bit, but not too strong.\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219201417.png)\n\n2. Fava beans + Sunflower seeds: Bit nutty.\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219201512.png)\n\n3. Fava beans + Gotland lentils: Embedded lentils are nice since they stay intact; the rest is nicely chewy. Nice texture. Winner! (Although when tempeh is being boiled, the lentils tend to fall out quite a lot)\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219201546.png)\n\n## Test starter cultures - LUVI vs. Topcultures (2020-10-07)\n\n250g **Toor dal**, soak o/n, then cook for **10 min**, drain. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), dry at 30°C in oven for 30 min, then divide into 2 parts (500 g cooked beans in total). Add 1/4 tsp (**1 tsp/kg**) starter, mix and incubate in perforated bags in oven at 30°C. 1) **Topcultures**, 2) **LUVI** starter.\n\n**16.5h**: Topcultures (34°C) nothing visible yet, LUVI (32°C) is already starting to get white and fluffy.\n\n**18.5h**: Topcultures (38°C), LUVI (36°C). Open door and leave on tray.\n\n**29.5h**: Topcultures: Not dense enough, leave in turned-off oven for another 12h (o/n). LUVI is sufficiently grown and smells nice (mild and slightly fruity) —\u003e put in fridge.\n\n**40h**: Topcultures is now also colonised, but not as much as the LUVI sample. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203258.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203317.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203418.png)\n\n### Conclusions\nThe Topcultures starter must have lost quite a lot of activity while stored at RT, from now on store all starter in the fridge (or freezer if larger batch)!\n\nUnfortunately I stored the tempeh samples untreated in the fridge for 6 days and then they were DISGUSTING! `They cannot be stored untreated for that long!! 3 days is probably the absolute maximum, so either heat-treat or freeze samples after incubation!` I had to throw it away.\n\n\n## Heat-treated vs. untreated toor dal tempeh\n\n250g **Toor dal**, soak o/n, then boil for **7 min**. Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 30°C. Add 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), mix. 1 bag: only Toor dal, 1 bag: a bit of ripped apart sockertång dispersed in the dal. Incubate in oven at 30°C.\n\n**21h**: Stop incubation, they are densely colonised. There is a tiny bit of sporulation starting around some of the holes. Both samples are colonies nicely, but the seaweed is kind of just sitting on top of the beans. There's no seaweed inside. On the surface, the seaweed feels a bit sticky/slimey.\n\nCut in half and freeze one half immediately. Heat-treat the other half by wrapping in aluminium foil and baking in a **85°C oven for 30 min**. Then leave on the counter a bit to cool, put in a tub and store in the fridge.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203738.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203801.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203820.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219203843.png)\n\nCook 8 days later:\n\nSplit into 4 pieces, let thaw (if frozen). No visual difference between frozen and heat-treated tempeh (other than that the not heat-treated one is slightly whiter). Slight difference in smell: frozen \u0026 thawed has fresh mushroomy smell, the heat-treated one smells mild and slightly stale.\n\nFor details of cooking experiment, see [Boiled vs. non-boiled - toor dal and black bean tempeh](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20cooking%20methods.md#Boiled%20vs.%20non-boiled%20-%20toor%20dal%20and%20black%20bean%20tempeh)\n\n## Black bean + fava bean mix\n\n250g **favabeans** and 125g **black beans**; soak separately o/n. Black beans: chop in food processor after soaking to about 1/3-1/4 of original size (though some remain whole!). Cook for **2 min**, drain. Favabeans: Cook for **2 min**, drain.\n\nMix both beans together, add 1.5 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix, spread on baking tray, let dry in 30°C oven, stir ocassionally. Add 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**) and incubate in perforated bags in oven at 30°C.\n\n**21h**: Turn off oven, leave for another 3h.\n\n**24h**: Harvest. Freeze one half immediately, heat-treat the other half immediately by wrapping in aluminium foil and baking at **85°C for 30 min**, then cool down and store in fridge.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219204646.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219204701.png)\n\n**Conclusions**: Good tempeh! No off notes at all. Very little sporulation, very good and fast mycelium growth. However, because of the relatively short incubation time, it tastes quite \"fresh\" and beany/starchy. Not chewy at all. Could be due to shorter time, more or less cooked beans, heat treatment or lack of boiling in soy-water. \n\n\nCook 8 days later:\n\nFor details of cooking experiment, see [Boiled vs. non-boiled - toor dal and black bean tempeh](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20cooking%20methods.md#Boiled%20vs.%20non-boiled%20-%20toor%20dal%20and%20black%20bean%20tempeh)\n\n\n## Fava beans + Gotland lentils - different incubation times (2020-10-28)\n\n200g **favabeans**, soak in cold water for 5h, then cook for **2.5 min**.\n\n57g **Gotlandslinser**, no soaking, cook for **12 min**.\n\nDrain, mix, spread on baking tray. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let evaporate at 30°C. Add 1/2 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), mix, incubate.\n\nHarvest at **24h**, **36h** and **48h**. Store in fridge (untreated) for 1 day. Then proceed with cooking.\n\nBoil each sample 2x2 min in 200 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce (= half strength of what I normally use). Dry on rack and store in fridge over night.\n\nFry and taste.\n\n**24h incubation samples**: Quite fragile, falls apart a bit. Not very bound. Quite starchy. Nice flavour. Bit crumbly. Maybe a crumbly topping? The lentils got nicely crunchy and are distinct inside the favabeans.\n\n**36h incubation samples**: Holds together better than 24h sample. Definitely a bit of a fermented taste. Looks very attractive with the embedded lentils. Could be more flavoured, the 1/2 concentrated soy-water mix is not as good as the normal one.\n\n**48h incubation samples**: Browns the best. Nice flavours, a bit more interesting. Bit dry and the fried lentils on the surface got quite (too?) crunchy.\n\n### Conclusions\nOverall, 24h sample falls apart too much and doesn't really taste of tempeh, just of lentils and beans. 36h and 48h are very close with 48h being slightly better. 36h tastes of several things, whereas 48h has a more rounded flavour profile. Both have kept a \"healthy\" tasting texture, i.e. more beans and lentils than meaty. Interesting since I'm sure earlier tempeh trials that resulted in very chewy-juicy tempeh were also incubated for 36-48h. Must be either the starter, the beans (e.g. soybeans) or the \"suboptimal\" incubation conditions in the fridge cupboard that cause the different texture. Both the 36h and 48h ones would be suitable for restaurants, whereas e.g. for a burger you'd want something chewier and juicier.\n\n`Run some more trials with different conditions and beans to see when I get a juicier texture vs. a beanier-healthier texture.`\n\n\n## Black eyed beans \u0026 black beans (2020-11-05)\n\nSoak for 24h: 125g black eyed beans, 125g black beans (from Fram).\n\n#### Black-eyed beans\nUse as they are, don't try to dehull. Change water and cook for **5 min**, then they are nicely done (almost too much maybe). Drain, add 0.5 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 40°C. Mix in 1/4 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill in bag and incubate in oven at 30°C (start: 21:00). Turn off oven at 22:00 (after 25h) and leave at RT until 12:00. Total incubation: **39h**. \n\nVery loose cake, falls apart when I try to lift it since the mycelium is not strong enough to hold the whole beans together. Would've been probably better to chop the beans a bit, and the skin is possibly also too tough for the fungus to penetrate properly. It also looks a bit unpleasant, since the black spots look like spore formation through the white mycelium.\n\n\n#### Black beans\nChop in food processor, 2-3 pulses. Rinse and boil for 2 min. (I could've probably treated the black beans like the black-eyed beans, i.e. not chopping or dehulling, and cooking for 5 min). Drain, add 0.5 Tbsp vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), let dry in oven at 40°C. Mix in 1/4 tsp LUVI starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill in bag and incubate in oven at 30°C (start: 21:00). Turn off oven at 22:00 (after 25h) and leave at RT until 12:00. Total incubation: **39h**. \n\nQuite loose cake, not as loose as the black eyed peas, but almost. Falls apart when boiling in soy water. The chopping helped to have the mycelium grow better, but it's still not strong enough to hold the mostly whole beans together. Looks good with the black skins though.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219210824.png)\n\n`The chopping doesn't really remove the hulls at all and just an irregular picture. However, the whole beans (black eyed beans) were not penetrated well by the mycelium and the cake was very loose. Therefore, chopping might be necessary for bigger beans with a tough skin.`\n\nFreeze half, heat-treat the other half (wrapped in aluminium foil, **85°C for 30 min** in the oven). Boiling in 200 mL water + 60 mL light soy sauce for 2 min on each side. The two other bean cakes crumble completely (esp. the black eyed beans one). Store in fridge until use.\n\n`Retry black bean tempeh with more cooking, like in this recipe and also with longer incubation time (48h): `\n[https://fullofplants.com/black-bean-tempeh-soy-free/](https://fullofplants.com/black-bean-tempeh-soy-free/) \n\n\n**Cooking**:\n\nThe two black bean tempehs were too crumbly to fry in one piece, so they were crumbled into a pan with oil and fried. This basically resulted in beans flavoured with soy sauce being fried. There was not much tempeh taste or feeling. They were a bit starchy, but tasty, especially with some sauce. We ate it in tortillas.\n\n\n\n## Black beans + toor dal, 3 different starters (2020-11-12)\n\n_Test LUVI, Topcultures and Raprima starters._\n\n\n**Toor dal** 180g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. The beans are quite soft, probably overcooked —\u003e mix with the black beans to balance that. Drain and let cool down, add a bit less than 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and mix.\n\n**Black beans** 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation.\n\nMix the two beans and make 3 portions:\n\n300g + 1/4 tsp **LUVI starter**, 300g + 1/2 tsp **Topcultures starter** (because I know it has lost activity), 240g + 1/4 tsp **Raprima starter** (just arrived, stored in freezer).\n\nIncubate in the oven at **32°C**, start 17:00. Turn off oven from 21:00-9:00. 32°C from 9:00-21:00, then off oven over night.\n\nLUVI grows fastest, very dense cake after 24h. Raprima only slightly less dense. Topcultures is lagging behind and not very dense yet after 24h.\n\nHarvest LUVI and Raprima at 9:00 (**40h**) and Topcultures at 20:00 (**51h**). LUVI and Topcultures: 285g, Raprima 230g.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219211955.png)\n\nStore in fridge until the next day, then heat treat at **85c for 30 min**.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219212022.png)\n\nSmell of LUVI and Raprima is mild and very slightly alcoholic or yeasty, whereas Topcultures is a bit off and musty. Topcultures also has a few patches of bad growth.\n\n\n**Cooking**:\n\nCut half of each cake into thick slices and boil in 400 mL water + 60 mL light soy sauce for 10 min. The other half, boil as a whole block. The slices soak up the liquid very well, but the block is not penetrated with liquid on the inside. `—\u003e When boiling, cut into slices!`\n\nFry the slices and taste.\n\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219212102.png)\n\n\nAll samples have a very similar consistency: chewy and juicy, but still with some beans inside, but not starchy! Yay! The toor dal has become more like a homogeneous mass that is nicely chewy and the black beans embedded in it give it a nice look and a nice change of texture, since they stayed a bit more beany.\n\n**LUVI tastes best, no off flavours, mild notes. Topcultures also tastes nice. However, Raprima has an unpleasant off-flavour!** `—\u003e Maybe it was over-fermented, or the 32°C were too high?? Test again by keeping everything else exactly the same but with lower temperature and take different time samples.` It was quite long fermented (40-50h!), because I turned off the heating during the nights, which is not ideal.\n\n**Definitely keep the long cooking time for the black beans and don't bother chopping or dehulling**. However, mash a small part of it with a fork, that definitely helped for growth.\n\n\n## Compare different incubation times (28h \u0026 40h); black beans and Toor dal (2020-11-18)\n**Toor dal**: 90 g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. `The beans are quite soft, probably overcooked —\u003e mix with the black beans to balance that.`\nDrain and let cool down, add a bit less than 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and mix.\n\n**Black beans**: 125g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down. Add 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**) and squash some beans with a fork to create some easily available starch for the fungi colonisation.\n\nMix toor dal and black beans together, add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter, fill in bag, incubate at 30°C in the oven. Start: 17:00.\n\n**21h**: Turn off the oven and let incubate for another 7 hours. \n\n**28h**: Harvest 2/3 of the block and freeze immediately. \n\n**40h**: Harvest the rest and freeze immediately. \n\nBoth blocks look amazing with dense white mycelium and nicely embedded beans, smell mild and nice, no ammonia smell, uniform. The 40h block has a very thick white mycelium layer all around, no sporulation visible at all.\n\n\n## Fava beans with salt, grey peas (2020-11-24)\n**Favabeans**:  Different kind this time, they look rounder and less fragmented. Ville picked them up directly from Marcus (18 SEK/kg). Soak o/n, cook for **4 min**. Add **1/2 tsp** to the cooking water so that the salt is just about tastable. The cooked beans taste nice and the salt definitely improves the taste. Add 1/2 Tbsp (4 Tbsp/kg) apple cider vinegar and let dry in 30°C oven\n\n**Grey peas**: From Ville. Soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Add 1/2 Tbsp (**4 Tbsp/kg**) apple cider vinegar and let dry in 30°C oven. Squash a few peas with a fork to provide starting material for fungus.\n\nMix each bean portion with 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (**2 tsp/kg**), then incubate at 30°C in the oven. Start: 13:00.\n\n**24h**: Favabean cake is nicely dense and has 35°C, so take out of the oven and let incubate at RT for another 5h (=29h). Store in fridge for 2 days. Grey pea cake is still somewhat loose, so incubate for another 24h (=48h). Store in fridge for 1 day.\n\n### Conclusion\nFavabenas worked really well and they make a nice, slightly chewy tempeh. They salt improved the taste a little bit, but not really enough to make it worth losing a bit of viability. Grey peas didn't work at all, the tempeh is very loose, barely holds together and in between the peas it has actually started to sporulate. Throw away! `—\u003e Salt addition is not really worth it for the taste, better to boil or marinate afterwards. Grey peas don't work at all if they are not dehulled and split!`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Red quinoa burgers (2020-11-27)\n\n**Red quinoa**: Garant, 125g. Wash thoroughly. Boil in 2-3x as much water for **15 min**, then drain, add 0.5 Tbsp (**4 Tbsp/kg**) apple cider vinegar, spread on baking tray, let dry in oven. Add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (**2 tsp/kg**), fill into small glass jars. Incubate in 30°C oven.\n\n**24h**: Turn off the heat, then leave for another 22h (=**44h)**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113226.png)\n\n### Conclusion\nVery nice and dense cake. Need a lot of air, so good to incubate in open dish. Turn off heat quite early, it produces a lot of heat.\n\n\n\n## Toor dal + black bean, Fava bean + black bean (2020-12-01)\n\n**Toor dal**: 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. Drain and let cool down, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg) and mix. Dry in oven at 30°C. Add 1/2 tsp (2 tsp/kg) of Raprima starter, mix.\n\n**Black beans**: 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **45 min**. Drain and let cool down, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg) and mix. Dry in oven at 40°C. Add 1/2 tsp (2 tsp/kg) of Raprima starter, mix.\n\n**Fava beans**: 250g, rinse and soak o/n, cook for **10 min**. `Much too long, should've been 3-4 min only! They are quite mushy and fragmented.` Drain and let cool down, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg) and mix. Dry in oven at 40°C. Add 1/2 tsp (2 tsp/kg) of Raprima starter, mix.\n\nMix toor dal with half of black beans (cooked weight: 225g). Mix favabeans with half of black beans (cooked weight: 225g). Then fill in bags (new bags ordered from Fyndiq: Zip bag 16x12cm, PE-LD): **300g** are a good amount to completely fill the bag and get a nice thick cake. Total: 4x300g and a small bag with the rest of all beans mixed (150g) (i.e. 750g dry beans made 1350g wet beans/tempeh).\n\nIncubate in oven at 30°C (start: 17:00).\n\n**21h**: Fava beans + black beans grew very fast (faster than the other mix) and also got hotter, so remove from oven and leave at RT for a few more hours (=24h in total). \n\n**28h**: Harvest fava beans + toor dal.\n\n### Heat treatment\nIn the bags (LD-PE has a melting point of \u003e105°C), wrap them in aluminium foil and leave at 85°C for 30 min, then they were still only 55°C on the surface, so I left them for another approx. 1h (so **1.5h** in total). Then the cakes had shrunk a bit and become a bit soft, so maybe I overdid it. They kept in the fridge for more than 2 weeks though, without a negative effect on taste!\n\n\n### Conclusion\nVery nice dense cakes, but the thickness of the cakes made them VERY hot during incubation (\u003e45°C!) and that's probably why they tasted a bit \"ripe\". Not inedible, but not ideal (in my opinion, Duncan doesn't care that much). `—\u003e Don't fill the bags quite as full, 250g is probably enough to get a nice thickness.`\n\nHeat-treated in the bag worked fine.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106115308.png)\n\n\n\n## Black bean, Adzuki bean, fava bean\n**Fava bean**s: From Ville (the rounder kind, dehulled). 250g, soak o/n. Cook for **2.5 min**. After cooking and drying: 430g (=1.7x). Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/2 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg). \n\n**Black beans**: From Kville Indian Shop. 125g, soak o/n, cook for 45 min without dehulling. After cooking and drying: 243 (=1.8x). Add 1/2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg).\n\n**Soy beans**: From Kville Indian shop. 250g, soak o/n, roughly dehull part of it, cook for **45 min**. After cooking and drying: 500 (=2x). Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/2 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg).\n\n**Adzuki beans**: From rawfoods.se. 125g, soak o/n, cook for **8 min** without dehulling. They lose a bit of the nice red colour, but are still pretty. After cooking and drying: 227 (=1.8x). Add 1/2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (4 Tbsp/kg). Add 1/4 tsp Raprima starter (2 tsp/kg).\n\nPut at 30°C in oven, start temperature of all bags: 27°C.\n\n**17h**: Turn oven off for a while, since all cakes are at 35°C.\n\n**21h**: Take soybeans out (36°C) to incubate a little longer on countertop. Leave the others (31-33°C) in the oven and turn on the oven again to 30°C.\n\n**26h**: Harvest and heat treat in plastic bags wrapped in aluminium foil, for 45 min at 85°C. \n\n### Conclusion\nThis incubation was too rapid and the tempeh tasted a bit ripe. \n\n## Soy bean + oat residue tempeh (2022-01-27)\n**Soy beans**: 250 g. Soak o/n, cook for 45 min, then drain and dry off a bit. Add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**). Add 1/2 tsp Raprima starter (**2 tsp/kg**).\n\n**Oat residue**: Leftovers from oat milk production, about 30% moisture. Stored in freezer until use. Microwave for a few minutes to kill off microbes. \n\nSoy bean + oat residue tempeh: Mix inoculated soy beans 1:1 with oat residue. Incubate in warm oven. Periodically turn oven on and off and open door, depending on temperature of tempeh blocks (thermometer sensor inside one block). \n\n### Conclusion:\nNice dense cake without much sporulation (only around air holes). \n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106143024.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106143050.png)\n\nAfter frying in oil: Texture is not bad. Dense and a little chewy. Also a bit fibrous but not too unpleasantly. Maybe a bitter hint (when unflavoured). Pretty good when flavoured with soy sauce.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106143208.png)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Dill-pickles":{"title":"Dill pickles","content":"\n![[projects/attachments/Screenshot 2022-06-10 at 20.05.47.png]]\n\nRecipe: [Vegetable recipes - Dill pickles](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Dill%20pickles)\n\n_2022-04-20:_\n\nNot as acidic and sweet as smörgåsgurkar, but still nice flavour.

It's a mix of two different apple trees, one of which is more for cooking/baking and the other one more for direct eating. I used about 8 small to medium-sized apples. \n\n\nTo test addition of lactobacillus starter cultures, I divided the cut veggies and fruits into four jars:\n1. no additional starter culture \n2. + Acidophilus starter culture\n3. + Vege092 starter culture\n4. + Vege011 starter culture\n\n\n_2022-10-31_: 24h, no cloudiness visible\n\n_2022-11-06 (7 days)_: \n1. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a little bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft. Not very acidic at all yet, leave a bit longer. Add a teaspoon full of liquid from a carrot ferment that's fermenting alongside to speed up fermentation a bit. \n2. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fresh jar, then transfer to fridge.**\n3. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft and a bit fizzy. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fresh jar, then transfer to fridge.**\n4. Looks clear, but when stirred it actually becomes a bit cloudy. Squash has a nice softer but still slightly crunchy texture. Apples are borderline too soft and a bit fizzy. Very mild acidity and a bit of a fermented apple cider taste. Quite pleasant, and I think shouldn't be out for much longer. **Transfer to fresh jar, then transfer to fridge.**\n\n_Conclusion_: After  a few days in the fridge, the acidity has become better and the ferment is very good. Butternut squash pieces are firm and almost crunchy, while the apple pieces are very fizzy, slightly crunchy and very refreshing. The saltiness of the ferment is not very high or obvious when eating it, it's more the fruity acidity that's predominant. \n\nGreat addition to any \"boring\" lunchbox to add acidity and some fruitiness. \n\n**The best of the four are number 3 and 4.** The apples retained the most crunch, while still being nicely fermented. For the butternut squash, there is not really any difference between the four jars (and starter cultures). In general, the one with Acidophilus is probably my least favourite, because the apples became a bit mushy and everything tastes a bit more \"rotten\"-fermented than in the others (which are more fresh and acidic-fermented). That was also the sample where yeast grew most while standing in the fridge.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Squash%20and%20apple%2001.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Fermented-vegetable-production":{"title":"Fermented vegetable production","content":"\n![](projects/attachments/Fermentation%20station.jpg)\n\n[Fermtented carrot and parsley root](projects/fermentation/fermented_carrot_parsley.md)\n\n[Hungarian celeriac kraut](projects/fermentation/Hungarian%20celeriac%20kraut.md)\n\n[Dill pickles](projects/fermentation/Dill%20pickles.md)\n\n[Fennel with mint and lemon](projects/fermentation/fennel_mint_lemon.md)\n\n[Turkish peppers](projects/fermentation/Turkish%20peppers.md)\n\n[UFO peaches](projects/fermentation/UFO_peaches.md)\n\n[Vietnamese carrot and daikon radish](projects/fermentation/vietnamese_carrot_daikon.md)\n\n[Fermented triple chili \u0026 peach sauce](projects/fermentation/Chili%20sauce.md)\n\n[Sauerkraut](projects/fermentation/Sauerkraut.md)\n\n[Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)\n\n[Chili sauce](projects/fermentation/Chili%20sauce.md)\n\n[Celeriac and carrot with caraway seeds](projects/fermentation/Celeriac%20and%20carrot%20with%20caraway%20seeds.md)\n\n[Brussel sprouts with garlic and pepper corns](projects/fermentation/Brussel%20sprouts%20with%20garlic%20and%20pepper%20corns.md)\n\n[Fermented apple with butternut squash](projects/fermentation/Fermented%20apple%20with%20butternut%20squash.md)\n\n[[Beet roots]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Filamentous-strains-on-waste-streams":{"title":"Filamentous strains on waste streams","content":"\nA wide range of filamentous fungi are used for SCP production: Neurospora spp., Monascus spp., Fusarium venenatum. \n\nProduction of mycoprotein and yeast SCP from industrial waste streams: \n\n\n**Dates**: Safety assays and nutritional values of mycoprotein produced by Fusarium venenatum IR372C from date waste as substrate.

When rice is below 40C, mix koji flour in.\n3. Cover dish with plastic wrap (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n4. Incubate at 30C. Check internal temperature every few hours, should be 27-35C.\n5. After 24h, sweet smell. Check temperature. Stir and break up lumps. Make furrows to dissipate heat.\n6. After around **40 h in total**, rice koji is ready.\n\n\n### Oat koji\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\nLike rice koji, but use 3 cups of oat groats instead. Soak groats for 6-8h, then steam until al dente. Follow the rice koji instructions.\n\nNice oatmeal cookie smell when done.\n\n\n### Barley koji\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\nMore prone to overheating! Nutty chestnut aroma when done. Will look less fuzzy than rice koji.\n\n- 1225 g pearled barley\n- 35 g wheat or rice flour\n- 2 g (2 tsp) koji starter\n\n1. Soak barley 6-8 h, drain and rinse. Steam for 1.5 hours or boil for 1h. Barley is done when the kernels are soft all the way through but not mushy. Drain and spread out on a drain to cool to below 40C.\n2. Toast the flour for 5 min, cool down. Add koji spores to cooled flour, mix well. \n3. Sprinkle koji flour on barley, mix very well.\n4. Put everything into a deep dish, cover with cling film (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n5. Incubate at 30C, check internal temperature every few hours (should be 27-35C).\n6. After 24-36h, surface growth and sweet, mushroomy smell. Monitor heat closely, stir and break up lumps, make furrows to dissipate heat. Adjust moisture if needed.\n7. After about **40 h total**, incubation is done.\n\n### Koji from LUVI\n(500g), Grind in mixer to powder. Add 200g water and mix to reconstitute = 700g fresh koji.\n\n\n## Shoyus and aminos\n### Soy-wheat shoyu\nFrom [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/):\n\nTraditional recipe: wheat berries/matvete (from soft wheat, not durum)= whole wheat kernel with bran, germ, endosperm but without the husk + soy beans.\nVariations: Use oats or barley instead of wheat, and lentils or chickpeas instead of soy beans.\n\n#### Ratio soy:wheat (legumes:grains): \n- Traditional **1 part dry soy, 1 part dry wheat** (by weight). \n- A bit more wheat: 1 part soaked soy, 1 part dry wheat. _The less wheat you use, the longer the sauce will have to ferment._\n\n#### Preparation:\n1. **Roast** the wheat berries in the oven until they are golden brown. Mill them in something like a coffee grinder on the coarsest setting or a food processor.\n2. **Soak** soy beans over night. (Soy beans will increase 2.3X when soaked, so calculate how much dry beans to use!)\n3. **Cook** soy beans for at least 40 min, until you can easily squeeze them between your fingers. Strain them and let steam a bit.\n4. **Mix** the steamy beans with the milled wheat (so the dry wheat soaks up the excess moisture). If it seems too wet, add more wheat. If it's too dry, spray some water onto it, or add more beans (if you have). Crush some of the soy beans with your hands.\n\n#### Inoculation:\n1. Dilute the spores, so they are easier to handle, with some flour.\n2. Check that **soybean/wheat mixture** has cooled down to below 40C. Spread spores over the mixture (e.g. with a tea strainer). Mix well.\n3. Line a pyrex dish with damp piece of cloth. Spread your mix into the dish. Cover with another moistened cloth. Put cling film over the dish, poke some holes in.\n4. Incubate (at **30C**) and keep a close eye on the temperature inside the koji, it can overheat very easily.\n5. After 24h, stir the mixture. Moisten the top cloth again if necessary. Put cling film back on and continue incubation. If koji overheats (\u003e37C) a lot, you have to stir a lot. Spread out in a thinner layer and turn off oven!\n6. After another 12h (**36h in total**) you should see a lot of growth. It shouldn't sporulate, but it's not the worst if it does a bit.\n\n#### Fermentation:\n1. Prepare a **15% brine**: 150 g of uniodised salt + 850 g of water. (You'll need about 1.65x the dry ingredients weight in brine weight).\n2. Clean your fermentation vessel well and pour in the koji.\n3. Pour the brine over the koji until the koji is covered. Let it soak for 1-2h. Pour some more brine until koji is covered again. Stir. You might have to add more brine over the next few days to keep the koji covered.\n4. Optional: Stir in a few tea spoons of unpasteurised miso to introduce beneficial bacteria.\n5. During the first **2-3 weeks, stir daily**. A lot of gas will be produced during that time that carry up solids to the surface. Push them down again so they don't get mouldy.\n6. Once your shoyu has settled down and is less active, reduce stirring to once every other day.\n\n#### Pressing:\nAfter **3-12 months**, put a cheese cloth into a sieve or colander, pour the fermentation mash in, cover with a cloth and put a weight on top. Let press over night. (Or use a cider press if you have one).\n\n#### Bottling:\n1. Clean bottles well, sterilise in oven (cover with aluminium foil, keep at 160C for at least 30 min, let cool down over night). Boil bottle caps in water.\n2. Heat the shoyu to 90C to kill off moulds and bacteria, but don't boil it! Pour the shoyu into the bottles and cap.\n\n\n### Bread aminos\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 680 g bread\n- 70 g all purpose or rice flour\n- 1 g (1 tsp) koji starter\n- 1.9 L water\n- 100 g for a 5% salt solution or 165 g for a 8% salt solution\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.\n2. Toast the flour in a pan over medium heat until slightly browned (5 min). Remove and let cool, then combine with koji spores.\n3. Mix koji-flour with bread cubes. Distribute very well.\n4. Transfer the inoculated bread to a casserole dish, cover with cling film and poke a few holes in.\n5. Set incubator to **30C** and place the pan in there. Check the internal temperature every few hours, it **should be 27-35C**.\n6. After 20-24h, you should notice a sweet smell. Stir the bread pieces, then continue to incubate for another 20-30h.\n7. When the koji is done, place everything into a glass jar. Boil the water with the salt and cool down to below 50C. Pour the brine onto the bread koji and mix thoroughly.\n8. Seal the jar with a lid and let sit at warm RT (27-29C) for 24h. Stir a few times during.\n9. Let mixture sit at regular RT for a week. Open the jar to release gases, stir at least once a day. After a week, the ferment should have settled down. When it's no longer active, seal the container and let it **age at RT for at least 6 months**.\n10. When you're ready to use the amino sauce, strain out the bread solids (or blend into a thicker sauce). Use the liquid for seasoning. Store in the fridge (because of low salt content).\n\n### Oat residue aminos\nAdapted from bread aminos (Shockey recipe) \nMade 2021-10-16 [Oat residue aminos](Oat residue aminos)\n\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 430 g dried oat residues (dried in oven at 50C for a day, from 1 kg fresh oat residue)\n- 44 g rice flour\n- 1 tsp **barley koji starter** (LUVI Ferments)\n- 1.2 L water\n- 63 g uniodised salt\n- 1 Tbsp seed miso\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Toast rice flour. Cool down to below 40C, then add about 1/5 of one bag of barley koji starter (whole bag is for 5 kg substrate).\n2. Disinfect a big bowl with Starsan and add the dried oat residues. _It feels rubbery, but not quite damp enough, so carefully add a little bit of water. Add 70 g of water and mix thoroughly with hands. Feels like a good dampness now._\n3. Mix in the flour koji starter with a tea strainer. Mix very thoroughly. _Oats feel quite dry again due to the flour, so add 100 g more water and mix._\n4. Pack into a Pyrex dish lined with a damp tea towel. Cover the oats with the tea towel, stick a thermometer in and cover with cling film + holes.\n5. Incubate at around **30C** until koji has grown nicely, but not sporulated (approx. **48h**).\n6. Place oat koji into a bowl, pour the (cooled down) brine onto it and mix throughly. Place in a large glass jar and leave at RT, stir occassionally for the next 2 weeks. _Mould forms on top over and over again, which looks exactly like koji mould —\u003e remove regularly and try to weigh down the solids to keep everything submerged (it’s hard, since the oat residue is very fine)._\n7. After about 2 weeks at RT in the open glass jar, divide between small plastic tubs with screw-top lids, fill completely to the brim and seal. Now leave at RT for up to 12 months.\n8. Strain away the solids and filter the liquid. Store in fridge until use. Use as flavouring agent when cooking.\n\n### Shio koji\n(1-2 weeks), Shockey\n- 250g (125g) rice koji\n- 50g (25g) salt\n- 470-705mL (235-352mL) water\n\n## Misos\n### Barley + fava miso\n1.

No weird bitterness, but a bit starchy. After boiling (before frying) the texture is nice, but a bit starchy, but not unpleasant.\n\n\n### Grilled in oven\n\n**Chana dal**: Starchy and dry. **Toor dal**: Not as dry as chana, more juicy and a bit crunchy. **Soy**: Quite beany or vegetable taste, too dry!! `—\u003e grilling in oven without any marinade or oil is not a good idea!! Turns out starchy and dry`\n\n### Conclusions\n**Toor dal** was the best in all cooking styles. **Chana** was only ok in the boiled+fried samples. **Soy** was pleasant in the fried, but not pleasant in the grilled. **Green mung dal** was the juiciest, but too punget (for me). Duncan liked the unusual taste. \n\n`—\u003e Maybe soy + green mung bean blend could work well?`\n\nBoiling before frying was MUCH better than frying alone. It takes up juicyness and flavour from the boiling liquid. `—\u003e test different ways of boiling it (duration, additions, dashi, tamari, etc.)`\n\n## Boiling + frying of different legumes\n\nFor tempeh, see: _[Different Swedish legumes/grains (2020-09-19)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Different%20Swedish%20legumes/grains%20(2020-09-19))_\n\nPut every sample (seperately) for **10 min into boiling water** (flipping once in between). Then let dry on a rack. Then fry in oil. No salt or soy sauce added this time to keep the natural taste. `—\u003e 10 min is probably too much. All samples got very soaked up, and it also cooks the legumes very much.`\n\n1. **Gula ärtor** (yellow peas): Crunchy sides are good, quite nice. Duncan found it unpleasantly starchy. They have more own taste (beany/peay, grassy) than other samples. Taste a bit more of something than e.g. the fava beans. Nice bite. Bit starchy.\n2. **Gotland linser** (Gotland lentils): Very distinct lentil taste, no chewy texture like in other samples. It's loosely packed lentils, almost no mycelium between. Starchy. `—\u003e Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. But it's a nice addition to a too smooth tempeh!`\n3. **Fava beans:** Very juicy/moist. Potato-cake quality. Pretty good, nice mix between something slightly starchy and meaty. `—\u003e Good candidate for mixing and further experiments!`\n4. **Brown beans**: I don't know what happened, but they had a really unpleasant, sour taste, even though no (unpleasant) smell at all. Kind of weird. No bite. Disappointing.\n5. **White quinoa**: Very juicy, but very dense. No seeds distinguishable, very homogeneous. Kind of beef-like, because it's a bit too chewy. `—\u003e Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. Also, reducing the cooking time might give it a bit more defined texture.`\n6. **Toor dal**: Very chewy, surprisingly homogenous. Kind of pork-vibe.\n\nWorst-to-best ranking:\n\n**Brown beans - Gotland linser - quinoa - gula ärtor - toor dal - fava beans.** `—\u003e Definitely work on the fava beans more, try combinations with quinoa and linser to give it a bit more bite and a nicer look. Also try additions like seaweed, chili, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame), etc.`\n\n\n## Boiled vs. non-boiled - toor dal and black bean tempeh\n\n[Toor dal tempeh](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Heat-treated%20vs.%20untreated%20toor%20dal%20tempeh)\n[Black bean + fava bean mix](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Black%20bean%20+%20fava%20bean%20mix)\n\nOf each tempeh, I have one frozen (8 days) and one heat-treated and stored in fridge.\n\nNo visual difference between frozen and heat-treated tempeh (other than that the not heat-treated one is slightly whiter). Slight difference in smell: frozen \u0026 thawed has fresh mushroomy smell, the heat-treated one smells mild and slightly stale.\n\n### Cooking test\n1. Unboiled\n2. Cook for 2 min in 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, flight half-time\n3. Cook for 5 min in 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, flip half-time\n4. Cook for 10 min in 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, flip half-time\n\nCook all samples in oil for the same amount of time.\n\n### Conclusions\nSurprisingly, the heat-treated tempeh had a better texture than the frozen one! It was not dried out as maybe expected. \n\nIn general, the boiled samples were MUCH better than the unboiled samples, both in taste and texture. **5 min boiling was the sweet spot**, whereas 2 min was also ok if you don't want a strong soy sauce taste.\n\n#### Fava bean + black bean, heat-treated\n1. Unboiled: Better texture than frozen, bit moist, still a bit starchy but beans are a bit more separated.\n2. 2min boiled: Right amount of seasoning if you don't want it to taste of soy sauce. Beans are more separated and less starchy than in frozen variant.\n3. 5min boiled: Perfect texture, firm beans but still a bit starchy. Not as squidshy as some past trials.\n4. 10min boiled. Too much soy, but good texture. Maybe good starting point for a jerky?\n\n\n#### Fava bean + black bean, frozen\n1. Unboiled: Bland, very starchy, not enough flavour.\n2. 2min boiled: Much better already (compared to unboiled), bit dry and starchy, probably enough flavour.\n3. 5min boiled: Good smell, good taste, slightly less dry than 2min boiled. Nicely compact, really good flavour, a bit like a bean burger, still a bit starchy.\n4. 10min boiled. Took up a lot of soy sauce, so more flavour and salt than the others. Good flavour. Similar texture to 2min and 5min, but a bit more homogeneous.\n\n\n#### Toor dal, frozen\n1. Unboiled: Fresh grassy note, very different texture to fava bean + black bean, almost potato-y.\n2. 2min boiled: Tastes like a potato. Nice flavour. Needs something else in it, not only toor dal.\n3. 5min boiled: Same as 2min boiled, but slightly saltier.\n4. 10min boiled: Same as 2min and 5min, but more (soy sauce) flavour.\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205716.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205737.png)\n\n![Black bean + fava bean tempeh fried in pan, unboiled, 2-5-10 min boiled](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205758.png)\n\n![Toor dal tempeh fried in pan, unboiled, 2-5-10 min boiled](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221219205816.png)\n\n\n## Red quinoa burgers (2020-11-27)\n\nFermentation: [Red quinoa burgers (2020-11-27)](projects/fermentation/Different%20legumes.md#Red%20quinoa%20burgers%20(2020-11-27))\n\nTwo different cooking methods:\n1. Simmer in soy-water: 100 mL water + 30 mL light soy sauce, 10 min simmering. Fry in oil.\n2. Marinate: 1 Tbsp HP sauce + some sugar + 1 glove of garlic, minces + some apple cider vinegar + some soy sauce. Marinate for 2 days in the fridge. Fry in oil.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe marinated burgers look VERY burger-like and brown super nicely. The boiled ones remain a bit white and \"raw\"-looking. Texture is good, a bit of chewiness and juicyness, but also a little bit porridge-like. The boiled ones have a slightly better, because slightly tougher, texture. The taste is very good, particularly of the marinated ones, quite meaty actually because they also soaked up a lot of flavour and also a lot of fat during frying.\n\n`—\u003e Definitely something that could be served to other people.`\n\nSee also [Mycobrewery instagram 2020-11-30](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIOspOnlpt1/)\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113610.png)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230106113631.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Toor dal + black bean tempeh: gulasch and Wellington (2020-12-01)\n\n### Gulasch\nI fried the tempeh bits with onions and then added paprika powder, stock, etc. Cooked it for almost 1h, but the tempeh held up quite nicely.

Bit of bubbling going on. Pepper tastes crunchy and slightly salty, not sour yet.\n- 5 days: Liquid is slighlty cloudy. Pepper has lost a bit of crunch. Got a bit sourness/bitterness. Not sour enough yet, leave a few more days.\n- 7 days: Pleasant and sour. Soft to bite, but still has a nice crunch to it. **Harvest!**\n\n_Conclusion_: Very clean, sour taste. The only slight bitterness comes from the skin, which is also a bit tough to eat (similar to the unfermented peppers). Will work well in sandwiches and salads, as well as on the side to other dishes. \n\nOver a few weeks in the fridge acidity has actually increased slightly, so now it's perfect. Still crunchy, on unpleasant off-flavours.

Leave for another day and taste again.\n- 7 days: Banana and slightly funky smell (like when I fermented the oat residues). Some kahm yeast growth on top of liquid. Fruit pieces have got a soft exterior and a crunchy core, and a clearly fermented taste. Should've maybe harvested 1-2 days ago when the fruits were still crunchy through and through? **Harvest today!**\n\n_Conclusion:_ Much more fermented tasting on the bottom than on the top of the jar --\u003e maybe stir next time. Clear kombucha vibes from the ferment: fruity-sweet and punchy-fermented-sour, with a bit of saltiness. Not sure yet how I will eat it, but would probably work well as a kind of chutney or together with other pickled vegetables. \n\nAfter 1-2 weeks in the fridge, the peaches have softened even more and disintegrated a bit, but also acidity has increased. They don't taste salty any more, but more fizzy, fruity and sour. quite a lot of kahm yeast growth on the top during fridge storage, but no bad smell or taste. \n\nMaybe add it to fermented chili peppers to make a hot sauce?

Peel and cut onion into rough cubes. Peel garlic cloves. \n\nArrange vegetables in jar and fill up with brine until everything is covered. Top off with 1 vine leaf and weigh down so everything's submerged. Leave at room temperature for a 7-14 days. When it has a nice pickel-y taste and the liquid is cloudy, it's ready. Blend in blender to get sauce with the desired consistency. A bit of vinegar adds a nice flavour. If it's too thick, you can add a bit of water. Adjust salt to taste. Optional: mix with fruit purré or fermented fruit to get a fruitier and slightly sweet condiment.\n\nFill into clean bottles and keep in fridge for 2-12 months.\n\n\n## Kimchi (vegan)\nRecipe adapted from: https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-vegan-kimchi-recipe\n\n_Made: 2022:_ [Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)\n\n- 1 large Chinese cabbage\n- 1 small daikon radish\n- 8 spring onions\n- flaky sea salt (kosher salt)\n- 8 garlic cloves\n- 4 cm piece of ginger\n- 1/2 cup gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)\n- 2 Tbsp miso paste (white or red)\n- 1 Tbsp sugar\n\n1. Wash cabbage, then remove trunk and cut the leaves into rough pieces (approx. 3x3 cm).\n2. Wash the daikon and cut into little sticks. \n3. Wash the spring onions, chop roughly and set aside. \n4. Place cabbage leaves, daikon and green parts of the spring onions into a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp flaky sea salt. Toss to combine and work in a bit with your hands. Cover with a plate or tea towel, then let sit at room temperature until cabbage is wilted (min. 1h, better up to 12h). The cabbage will release some liquid. \n5. Combine white parts of spring onion, minced garlic, finely chopped ginger, chili flakes, miso paste and sugar in a blender or food processor. Start pulsing to combine everything. Slowly add water to get to the right pasty consistency for it to blend properly (approx. 1 cup). Blend this past about 30 sec, scraping down the sides to not have too big chunks. \n6. Add the chili paste to the wilted cabbage and mix well with a spoon. \n7. Prepare glass jars by pouring boiling water into them and leaving to soak for a bit. Empty the jars and let cool down. \n8. Fill the cabbage-chili mixture into the jars, pressing down firmly with a spoon or chop stick to pack it tightly and not leave any air pockets. Make sure the top is covered with some of the liquid. \n9. Close jars and leave at room temperature for 24h. Then transfer to fridge and allow to ferment for at least 3 weeks before eating.  \n\nIt will not develop much CO2, so it's actually ok to close the jar tightly. I still air it from time to time during the first days and weeks, when I think about it. \n\nIt will last forever in the fridge and just get more sour and softer.

For dairy, both are firm, but for soy the 092 is still liquid after 8h. The acidity is quite low in all of them, although dairy 053 is quite pleasant. Soy 053 is very mild and vanilla-y. \n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\nContinue fermentation over night in the turned-off rice cooker: **10h, 40°C-RT** (=18h in total).\nAll yogurts are firm now, to differing degrees. Stir before tasting.\n- Dairy 053: Quite runny. Nice mellow acidity without sticking out too much. No off-flavours. **Duncan's favourite** (\"Tastes the most like yogurt.\").\n- Dairy 092: Also runny, but not as much as 053. In addition, there's a thick, slimy component to the texture that gives it nice body. Acidity is very mild (milder than 053), no off-flavours sticking out. **Silfa's favourite**. \n- Soy 053: Quite runny, similar to dairy 053, though a bit more watery (might be also due to the lower fat). Too sour, very strong single acidity that reminds of red currant and tingles on the tongue. Fruity notes, vanilla. \n- Soy 092: Quite runny, very similar to soy 053. Missing the body of dairy 092. Strong vanilla note and quite strong acidity. Some undefinable off-notes. Duncan thinks it's pretty bad tasting.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a few days in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 053: Soft and good body, a bit watery. Just plops off a spoon. Quite acidic and quite clean acidity. No off notes.\n- Dairy 092: Thick and gloopy, almost a bit stretchy. Drips off a spoon in a slightly viscous way. Very good almost buttery taste and fine acidity (not overwhelming). Still Silfa's favourite. \n- Soy 053: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Quite runny texture. Very sour and quite a one-note, clean acidity, bit fizzy on the tongue. Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Not much body (neither in texture nor in taste). A bit too sour for me to eat/enjoy. Duncan thinks it has similar sourness to fil, but needs more body/thickness.\n- Soy 092: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Quite runny texture, but also a tiny bit viscous. Sour, but also a mild/buttery note. Has more body in flavour than 092, better. Duncan likes this better, mostly because of the vanilla note.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Find higher fat soy milk? \n- Test same cultures with oat milk\n- Test different cultures and compare\n- Some time in between would probably be good, e.g. 10h at 40°C.\n\n### Vege011 and Öresunds fil starter cultures\n_2022-06-16_\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 01**, **Öresunds fil (Skånemejerier)**\n\nSubstrates: Fresh dairy milk (3% fat), Alpro soy milk (1.8% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milks to approx. 90°C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: \n- Freeze-dried culture: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (approx. 1/8 tsp) into 25 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 5 mL of that to inoculate each jar (of about 200 mL).\n- Store-bought fil: Take 1/2 Tbsp of fil and stir into each jar (of about 200 mL) = **1/4 Tbsp/100 mL**. \n\n**1st fermentation**: **8h, 40°C** (in the rice cooker)\n\nAfter 3h, the fil-inoculated soy and dairy milks already firmed up and started to get sour, while the Vege011 milks were still liquid and sweet. \n\nAfter 6h, the fil-inoculated firmed up even more, Vege011 were getting a little bit thicker.\n\nAfter 8h: fil-inoculated firmed up a lot in both soy and dairy. Vege011 have soft yogurt consistency.\n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\n- Dairy 011: Quite loose structure. Not very sour but nice taste.\n- Soy 011: Quite loose structure, looser than dairy 011. Not sour, quite sweet actually and very vanilla-y.\n- Dairy fil: Good stable gel-structure and very nice sourness. But not so nice to taste warm.\n- Soy fil: Firmness in between Dairy fil and Dairy 011. Not as sour as dairy fil but pleasant. Very vanilla-y.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a day in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 011: Smells very animaly/milky. Has firmed up a lot and holds shape on spoon. Mellow acidity, bit funky. Very pleasant. Slight cheesiness maybe. Great texture, almost like stirred yogurt from the start. Much denser than the soy yogurts. When stirred it becomes very homogenous and smooth, with a bit of a gloopy, viscous texture that slowly drips off a spoon. Duncan: texture is better, but taste is not much better than the soy gurts. \n- Soy 011: Smells like vanilla yogurt. Wobbly-gelly. Very loose, runny structure. Taste is very nice. Not really sour, but the sweetness of the soy milk has disappeared and it's quite neutral with a nice vanilla note. When stirred, it's very runny and looks almost like custard. Curdles a bit. Very refreshing taste. Duncan found it watery, but after adding a bit of salt it tasted much better.\n- Dairy fil: Smells a bit lemony. Great taste, very pleasant. Rich taste, mellow acidity, no off flavours. Texture is quite firm, stays on spoon. But when stirred it becomes nicely soft and smooth, even a bit thinner than dairy 011 and a bit less viscous. Duncan: could still have more acidity, but nice taste.\n- Soy fil: Smells less like vanilla and more a bit animaly/milky. A bit more sour than soy 011, but also not very strong. Very nice acidity level actually. Vanilla aroma is not overwhelming, but present. Texture is like a loose gel. When stirred, it gets almost gloopy. More homogeneous texture than soy 011, very smooth. Clean taste. Duncan thinks it should be more acidic.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Dairy 011 and dairy fil are quite similar in taste, texture and acidity level. Dairy 011 is a bit more mouth-filling and viscous, maybe some bacteria that make exopolysaccharides?\n- Soy011 is too loose and thin. Try fermenting longer? \n- Soy fil worked really well, but could also benefit from a bit longer fermentation.\n- The vanilla taste in the soy milk is a bit much, try to find another plant milk to test.\n- Salt improves taste of soy yogurts. \n\n## Oat\n_2022-05-06\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 053**, **Vege 092**\n\nSubstrates: Oatly chilled mellan (1.5% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milk to approx. 90°C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (fraction of 1/4 tsp) into 10 mL of water, shake.

Neither lemon nor mint seemed to have had much impact on taste (uness the bitterness comes from the lemon, in which case it had a negative impact).\n\nAfter 2 weeks in the fridge, the anise taste has mellowed out a bit and the acidity has increased nicely. **7 days was a good time to get it nicely sour, but still keep crunchiness**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Fennel.jpeg)","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/fermented_carrot_parsley":{"title":"Fermented carrot and parsley root","content":"\n![[projects/attachments/Screenshot 2022-06-10 at 20.07.38.png]]\nRecipe: [Vegetable recipes - Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Vietnamese%20pickled%20carrot%20and%20daikon)\n\n_2022-03:_\n\nMade with **parsley root** instead of daikon. \nTastes really nice and no problems with fungi or yeasts during incubation.

Iron interfacing on the ones where necessary:\n\t1. 2x piece 11 on main fabric\n\t2. 1x piece 6 on main fabric\n2. Transfer the markings for the fly on the front pieces to the fabric (on the wrong side), then baste stitch with a contrasting thread so it appears on the right side. \n3. Only on right-side front piece: Press 1 cm fold on the fly tab.\n4. Only left-side front piece: Trim away the 1 cm fly tab (that you just pressed to the back on the right-side front piece)\n5. On each of the front pieces, sew a form tape interfacing (1 cm width, non-stretch) along the waist line.  _Helps to prevent deformation and stretching of the waist._\n6. If Italian pockets are done: fuse a 3 cm wide piece of interfacing all along the future pocket opening on the front pieces (on wrong side of fabric).\n7. Overlock the insides of the legs of the front and back pieces. On the right-side front, only up to the fly where the tab starts, but no the fly tab (that was pressed to the inside). Also overlock the bottom parts of the legs on the front and back pieces, as well as the outside of the legs on the back pieces. _Be careful not to stretch the fabric, especially when overlocking the inside of the crotch!_\n8. Press a 4 cm hem on the bottom of the front and back piece legs.\n9. Transfer the markings for the back pockets onto the right and wrong sides of the fabric on the back pieces. \n10. Sew the darts on the back pieces and press them towards the crotch. \n11. Iron on interfacing where the back pocket openings will be.\n12. On each of the back pieces, sew a form tape interfacing (1 cm width, non-stretch) along the waist line.  _Helps to prevent deformation and stretching of the waist._\n13. Back pocket lining: transfer the placement of the pocket to the right side of the back pocket lining piece. \n14. Italian pockets: Front pocket linings 2x piece 10: fold wrong sides together in the middle (line up notches - the top and the bottom curve should match) and iron. Front pocket opening 2x piece 8: overlock the short part and the longest part only. Then place the front pocket opening wrong side to wrong side to the front pocket lining and stitch the two pieces with a long stitch (4) together, a few mm away from the edge. Pin the wrong side of the pocket lining to the right side of the front leg at the pocket opening. Stitch along the outer edge at 1 cm. Then press the seam allowance towards the pocket lining and understitch it in place (2 mm away from the other stitching line). Then iron the pocket towards the back of the front leg. Then sew the pocket shut with French seams. For that, fold the pocket lining right sides together along the lower edge. Sew with an overlocker along the bottom edge at 8mm (so that 3 mm will be cut off and sewn at 5 mm). Then fold the pocket inside out, press, and sew over the newly made stitch line at 6 mm, so that the overlocker stitching is encased. Then align the top edge of the trouser leg with the pocket and stitch along at 5 mm to hold it in place. Also, stitch a bit (at 5 mm) on the side of the trouser leg, below the pocket opening, to keep the pocket in place. \n15. Back pocket (welt pocket): Cut a 2cm wide x 8cm long strip on the main fabric, then fold and press like a bias tape. Stitch along the long edge as close to the edge as possible, then shorten the strip to 6.5 cm. Fold the strip in half to form a little loop. On the back trouser leg with the welt pocket, pin the loop pointing upwards in the middle of the outlined welt pocket. Stitch at 5 mm to keep in place.

Alle Teile im Stoff ausschneiden, Markierungen übertragen, bügeln.\n2. Knopfleiste: Bei beiden Vorderteilen (Achtung: müssen spiegelverkehrt sein!), die vordere mittlere) Kante 1 cm nach links umbügeln. Dann nochmal 3 cm bei der selben Kante umbügeln, und mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Mit geradem Stich (Stichlänge 2.5) knapp neben der umgeschlagenen Kante die ganze Länge runternähen. \n3. **Knopflöcher** (nur im rechten Vorderteil!): Knopflöcher-Markierungen auf den Stoff übertragen (sowohl vertikal als auch horizontal). Dann mit Knopflochfuß und richtigen Abmessungen (hängt von der Knopfgröße ab) die Knopflöcher nähen.\n4. **Brusttasche(n)**: Mit Vorlage die Taschenposition(en) auf den Vorderteilen markieren. Dann das Taschenteil oben 2 cm nach links umfalten und bügeln. Dann nochmal 2 cm umbügeln und mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Dann knappkantig drübernähen. Dann alle restrlichen Kanten 1 cm nach links umbügeln. _Wäre es nicht besser die 3 anderen Kanten zuerst zu bügeln und dann die oberste?? Schaut sauberer aus._ Dann auf das Vorderteile stecken und auf 3 Seiten knappkantig von der rechten Seite annähen. \n5. Rückenteil: Die Mittelfalte in Rückenteil und Passen (yokes) bügeln. Am Rückenteil, die Knips zur Mittelfalte legen (links) und feststecken (d.h. Knips genau auf die hintere Mitte legen). In 5 mm Abstand von der Kante über die Kellerfalte nähen um sie zu fixieren. Eine Passe rechts auf rechts auf das Rückenteil legen. Die andere Passe unter das Rückenteil (rechte Seite von Passe auf linke Seite von Rückenteil) legen. Alle Ecken und Kanten der drei Teile schön aufeinanderlegen. In 1 cm Abstand alle drei Teile entlang der Oberkante zusammennähen.  Bügeln. \n6. Schulternähte schließen: Rückenteil rechts nach oben hinlegen, beide Vorderteile rechts auf rechts darauf, an Schulterkanten ausrichten. Mit Nadeln fixieren, aber nur **eine** Passenlage (die äußere)  und das Vorderteil! Dann Vorderteile mit Rückenteil einrollen, das ganze Stoffpaket wenden (liegt jetzt auf den eingerollten Teilen), und die andere (innere) Passe um das Stoffpaket einschlagen sodass die Schulternähte der beiden Passen wieder aufeinandertreffen. Mit Nadeln festestecken und in 1 cm Abstand die Schulternähte nähen (3 Stofflagen). Dann das ganze Stoffpaket durch das Halsroch rausziehen. Nähte bügeln. \n7. Ärmel: Ärmel rechts auf rechts auf das Hauptteil legen. Ärmelknips genau auf die Schulternaht legen. Dann die Ecken des Ärmelteils mit den anderen Knipsen am Hauptteil angleichen und mit Nadeln fixieren. Mit 1.5 cm Nahtzugabe die Ärmel festnähen. Bügeln, sodass die Nahtzugaben zum Ärmel zeigen. Kanten versäubern. \n8. Seitennaht schließen (mit French seams): Bluse mit Vorderseite nach oben hinlegen, Ärmelnähte und Seitennähte aufeinander (**links auf links**). Mit Nadeln fixieren. Mit 5 mm Nahtzugabe nähen. Die Naht platt bügeln und mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Dann von der linken Seite (Stoffteile liegen rechts auf rechts) knapp neben der anderen Naht (also mit ca. 6 mm Abstand) Ärmel und Seitennaht entlang nähen. Naht platt bügeln mit Nahtzugaben zur Vorderseite hin. \n9. Kragen: Beide Kragenteile rechts auf rechts aufeinenderlegen. Die kurzen Seiten und die lange obere Seite mit Stecknadeln fixieren. Mit 1 cm Nahtzugabe an diesen drei Seiten entlang nähen. Ecken diagonal abschneiden, dann Kragen umdrehen und bügeln. _Optional: den ganzen Kragen in 5 mm Abstand rundum absteppen._ Einen der Stege mit Rundunden nach oben (und rechts nach oben)hinlegen, die Knipse mit der ungenähten Kante des Kragens abstimmen. Dann den anderen Steg rechts auf rechts drauflegen (der Kragen ist also zwischen den zwei Stegen), und die gesamte obere Kante feststecken. Mit 1 cm Abstand nähen: die Rundungen der Stege, dann weiter entlang der Kante des Kragenteils. _Achtung: nicht direkt an der Kante der Stege zu nähen beginnen, sondern 1 cm frei lassen (am Anfang und am Ende._ Nahtzugaben an den Rundungen kürzen und einschneiden. Dann alles umdrehen und bügeln. \n10. Kragen annähen: Kragen-Steg-Teil rechts auf rechts auf das Vorderteil legen, Ecke mit Nahtzugabe genau an die Kante. Nur den inneren Steg mit Nadeln auf das Vorderteil stecken. Das selbe mit der Ecke auf der anderen Seite. Dann die ganze Kante des Stegs entlang an das Hauptteil stecken. Mit 1 cm Abstand annähen. **Sicherstellen dass die Ecken des Stegs wirklich genau mit den Kanten des Vorderteils abschließen!** Hauptteil umdreehen, d.h. mit links nach unten auflegen. Dann die Nahtzugaben des äußeren Stegs nach innen falten, ca. 1 cm, aber soweit dass es ein bisschen über die Naht am Hauptteil hinausgeht, d.h. dass diese Naht verdeckt wird. Alles entlang mit Nadeln abstecken. Dann auf der rechten Seite entlang nähen, möglichst nahe neben der Falte. _Auf der linken Seite kontrollieren ob alle Stofflagen erwischt wurden._\n![](projects/attachments/Noella%20blouse%2002.png)\n11. Optional: Knopflock am Kragen: Horizontales Knopfloch am Ende des Stegs nähen. \n![](projects/attachments/Noella%20blouse%2004.png)\n\n12. Säume: An der Unterkante der Bluse 1 cm umbügeln. Dann nochmal 1 cm umbügeln, mit Nadeln fixieren, möglichst nahe an der umgebügelten Kante festnähen. Das selbe mit den Ärmeln. \n13. Knöpfe annähen. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.259163045Z","tags":null},"/projects/sewing/Sewing-and-fitting-tricks":{"title":"Sewing and fitting tricks","content":"\nAlways fit from the top down!

You could choose something with stretch, but it’s not necessary. Canvas, denim, duck and most twills are a good option.\n\n## Tutorial\nYoutube: https://youtu.be/DXlssllVSVE\n\n\n## Pictures\n\n![](projects/attachments/Top%20pants%2001.png)\n(Credit: Open Studio Patterns https://openstudiopatterns.com/patterns/p/shop-pant)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Top%20pants%2002.png)\n(Credit: Open Studio Patterns https://openstudiopatterns.com/patterns/p/shop-pant)\n\n![](projects/attachments/Top%20pants%2003.png)\n(Credit: @enderallsews https://www.instagram.com/p/CdWHMFCukPc/)\n\n\n## Sewing progression\nYoutube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXlssllVSVE\n\n**0.5'' / 1.27 cm seam allowance, unless otherwise mentioned**\n\n### Prepare the fabric pieces\n1. Iron on interfacing on pieces 10 and 11 (and optionally also 8 and 9).\n\n### Leg pieces\n1. Attach bottom pieces (Front hem, pieces 5; Back hem, pieces 4) of legs to all 4 legs (pieces 1, 2 and 3) - right sides together. Match the notches. \n2. Overlock the seams together, then press the seam allowances towards the bottom of the trouser leg. \n3. Top stitch on the right side of the trouser legs at 0.25''/**0.6 cm** away from the seam on top of the seam allowance. Use a slightly longer stitch length than for the normal sewing.\n4. Sew the darts on the back leg pieces and press towards the side seams.\n5. Overlock the inside rise of the front legs.\n6. Overlock the inside rise of the back legs.\n7. Overlock the inside of the front and back legs.\n\n\n### Pockets\n1. Overlock the two shorter sides (i.e. the interior edges) of Front Pocket Facing (pieces 6).\n2. Stitch the **wrong** side of piece 6 to **right** side of Pocket Bags (pieces 7) along the serged edges with **0.6 cm** seam allowance. \n3. Right sides together, align the pocket bags with the front trouser legs, stitch with **1 cm** seam allowance. Pivot the needle in the corner to get a sharp edge. When finished stitching, clip the sharp point for clean turning.\n4. Press the seams of the pocket bag open and turn the pocket bags. Then top stitch at 0.3 cm from the finished edge through both layers, sandwiching the seam allowance in between those layers.\n5. Then, fold the pocket bag in on itself and align with the outer edge of the front leg. Stay stitch on the top (waist) and the side (hip) at the pocket opening, for about 4 cm. Don't stitch over the pocket opening though!\n6. Overlock the lower edges of the pocket bag together to close the pocket bag.\n7. Topstitch a little **0.6 cm** wide rectangle on short end of the pocket opening through all layers of fabric. This is to hold the pocket down so it doesn't flip inside out later.\n\n### Back pockets\n1. Fold over the top of the back pockets by 1.9 cm, press. Fold over again by **1.9 cm**, press.\n2. Topstitch the folded-over hem **0.3 cm** from the edge. \n3. Overlock the other sides of the back pockets, fold over by **0.9 cm**, press.\n4. Line up one of the back pockets with the marks on the back legs and top stitch **0.3 cm** from the edge to the back leg. Reinforce the openings by sewing a little triangle. \n5. Pin on the second back pocket on the trouser leg. Before sewing on the second back pocket, make triple sure that they line up, even after the two back legs are sewn together! \n\n### Fly and zipper\n1. Fold fly extension (piece 8) right sides together in half and stitch the bottom closed with **1.27 cm **seam allowance. Clip the corner and fold inside out.\n2. Press the fly extension and sew the raw edge closed with **0.6 cm** seam allowance. Overlock the raw edge. \n3. Fly front (piece 9): overlock the curved edge. \n4. Place right and left front legs right sides together on top of each other (there will be a little overhang on the right leg, which is normal). Stitch the rise at **1.27 cm** seam allowance up to the drill hole marked on the right leg pattern piece. Press the seam open.\n5. Line up the zipper tape with the serged edge of the fly extension (align top of zipper on the serged short edge) and stay stitch.\n6. With right sides together, stitch the fly extension to the right leg, **1.27 cm** from serged edge. Stop at the end of the zipper end, approx. **1.5 cm** before the end of the fly extension.\n7. Fold the fly extension open and press the seam allowance towards the side of the trouser leg. Then top stitch along the zipper and stop again 1.5 cm before the end of the fly extension.\n8. Fly front: with right sides together, sew onto the left leg with **1.27 cm** seam allowance, all the way (as much as possible) to the end of the fly front. Then press the seams open and press the fly front onto the inside of the leg.\n9. Open the zipper and stitch it right side to the right side of the fly front. NB: The zipper teeth must be **1.27 cm** away from the edge of the fly front. Don't line up the fly front flush with the opposite side of the zipper opening, it should overlap a bit. Make sure to align the waistline of both legs. _Tip: Use magic tape to glue the zipper to the fabric and see if everything lines up nicely. _\n10. On the outside of the left leg, draw a nice J-curve (using the fly front patttern) from the waste band to the end of the zipper. The drawn J-curve should follow the fly front on the inside, about 0.6 cm away from its edge. Pin the fly extension out of the way on the inside to not stitch over it. Then stitch on the outside with a fairly long straight stitch (too short doesn't look good!) along the drawn curve. Use the handwheel to get around the curve nicely. The J-curve ends by stitching just about across the whole zipper end. \n11. On the inside, move the fly extension over the fly front. Then on the outside, make a little bartack to keep the fly extension in place. \n\n### Assemble legs\n1. Back legs: with right sides together at the rise, stitch with **1.27 cm** seam allowance. Press the seam allowances apart. \n2. Back + front legs: with right sides together, stitch the outside seams with **1.27 cm** seam allowance. Make sure to line up the seams on the leg extensions nicely. \n3. Overlock and press the seams together towards the back of the trousers. Then top stitch the seam allowances to the back legs, **0.6 cm** from the seam. \n4. Sew the front and back leg inseams right sides together with 1.27 cm seam allowance. Press the seam allowances apart. \n\n### Waist band\n1. Fold the belt loop (piece 12) in half and press. Fold both raw edges in to meet, then press again. \n2. Top stitch the belt loop piece along both long sides **0.3 cm** from the edge. \n3. Cut belt loop piece every **7.6 cm** to get 5 pieces of equal length. \n4. Line up the belt loops along the waist band, then stay stitch along the whole waist band at **0.6 cm** and secure the belt loops in place at the same time. \n5. Line up right sides together one each of left waistband (piece 10) and of right waste band (piece 11). Stitch along the short side on the curved side at 1.27 cm. Press the seams open.\n6. Put the resulting two long waistband pieces right sides together on top of each other. Sew along the inner curve, as well as the short sides, at 1.27 cm seam allowance.\n7. Clip the corners of the sewn seam allowance. \n8. Turn the waist band right side out and press flat. \n9. Waist band should sit nice and flush on the left side of the zipper opening, as well as nice and flush on the right side of the zipper opening. Match up the notches with the side seams and the back seam with the back seam.

Three little mountains with a view over the coast and to the Danish island Bornholm. Sandy beaches at the bottom (badplats!). Nice arboreum.\nFairly small and can easily be done in a day. Quite many people around (during summer season). Not really a \"wild\" national park, but still nice to walk through. \n\nWent there in August 2021: [Stenshuvuds nationalpark](trips/Stenshuvuds%20nationalpark.md) \n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nBus to Kivik (via Kristianstad) or bus via Lund and Simrishamn. Then the last few kilometers walking (6 km, e.g. along Skåneleden from Kivik to Simrishamn) or taxi.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamp ground at the northern entrance. Hotels and guesthouses in Kivik. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nSkåneleden goes through. \nVery easy to find hiking trails, well marked. The longest is not even 5 km long. \n\n\n## Dalby Söderkogs nationalpark\nSweden's smallest national park. Old southern Swedish leafy forest (oak, beech). Augustiner kloster from 1060s. \n\n#### Good to know\n- Prettiest in spring when vitsippor and gulsippor are covering the ground. \n- The naturrum is in Skrylle naturreservat.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nBus (50 min) from Lund Central.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nVinskydd in neighbouring Skrylle naturreservat. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nThree walking routes (0.5-3.5 km). One of them - Skryllestigen - then continues on through the naturreservat Dalby Norreskog and further to Skrylle naturreservat, which is actually much bigger than Dalby Söderskog. \n\n\n## Söderåsen nationalpark\nNorth-western Skåne, near Helsingborg. Goes from Åstorp to Röstånga. Lies exactly between European and Scandinavian continental plates, which formed a ravine and pushed up a small mountain (Kopparhatten, 200 m). \n\nBeech forests, high cliffs, ravines and a little river running through. Good views all around from the top of Kopparhatten. Quite small, but still Northern Europe's biggest protected leafy forest.\n\nWent there in June 2022: [Söderåsen nationalpark](trips/Söderåsen%20nationalpark.md)\n\n#### Good to know\n- Main entrance is in Skäralid, the Southern entrance in Röstånga. \n- Possible to go up Kopparhatten with the car.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Klippan, then bus to Skäralid or Röstånga (30 min). \n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamp grounds and vindskydd can be found at Dahlbergs and Liagården. Guesthouses in Röstånga. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nSkåneleden goes through the park (from Röstånga to Skäralid and then further on to Klåveröd). Several other trails between 2 and 7 km long starting from both Skäralid or Röstånga.\n\n\n## Åsnens nationalpark\nSweden's youngest national park (2018). Like a Sweden in miniature. Forests, lakes, islands. Nice in all seasons, but especially in winter when it's possible to walk on frozen lakes or in the autumn when Småland's mushroom Koralltaggsvampen grows. Many different kinds of trees including 250 year old beech trees.\n\nhttps://visitasnen.se/\n\n#### Good to know\n- Nice to go around by kayak or canoe. \n- Main entrance at Sunnabron, south of Växjö. Smaller entrance in Trollberget on the western side of the lake.\n- In some areas entrance is prohibited from 1 April to 31 July due to bird protection.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Växjö. Then a 44 min bus ride (or 4h30min walking) to Kråketorp gets you to the northern tip of the lake. From there it's 3h walk to the main entrance.\n\nTo enter from the southern side, bus from Växjö to Vipan or Torget Ryd are maybe good options. \n\n#### Stay overnight\nOne vindskydd with place for 3-4 tents near Utsikten. Nice-looking B\u0026B places around, e.g. Toftahult B\u0026B.\n\n#### Hiking routes\nSeveral small-ish ones around the three main entrances. Along the west side of the park leads the [cycle route Åsnen runt](https://www.naturkartan.se/sv/kronobergs-lan/asnen-runt)(140 km, along an old railway line with many nice views of the lake). There's also a 120 km long canoe route called [Värendsleden](https://www.naturkartan.se/en/kronobergs-lan/varendsleden?guide_id=64). \n\n\n## Store Mosse nationalpark\nIn the highlands of Småland. Raised bog (largest south of lapland) with 7m thick peat layer. Nature is barren. One of the best bird lakes in Sweden - Kävsjön. Not unusual to see elks (esp. at dusk or dawn), otters or one of the 19 bat species living here. \n\n#### Good to know\n- Bring water-proof shoes (maybe even wellies).\n- Around Kävsjön it can be quite many visitors, but usually the southern and eastern parts of the park are emptier. \n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain via Hässleholm and Alvesta to Värnamo (3.5 hours from Helsingborg). Another 15-20 min bus to get closer to the park, and to get to Hillerstorp.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nSeven camping sites in the park, and two old gårds - Lövö and Svanö (no electricity or water). \n\n#### Hiking routes\nRoutes of various length, altogether 50 km (about half of them with wooden planks). Cycle route [Hillerstorpareleden](https://vastrasmaland.se/sv/gnosjo/hillerstorpareleden/) goes right through the park from Hillerstorp to Värnamo. A 12 km long route leads around Kävsjön starting at the naturum. A 14 km long route goes from the naturum to the southern end of the park at Andersberg. On this one you can get vildmarkskänsla. \n\n\n## Blå Jungfruns nationalpark\n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Norra Kvills nationalpark\nVildmark in miniature. Big rocks and 350 year old trees, mostly pines. Not very big park. \n\n#### Good to know\n- A few km south of the park is the Kvills naturreservat that houses Kvilleken - Sweden's biggest and oldest tree (1000 years old). \n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\nTwo hiking routes, one 2.5 km long and one 4 km long. \n\n\n## Gotska Sandöns nationalpark\n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Kosterhavets nationalpark\nFirst marine national park (2009). 400 islands and skerries. \n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nFerries from Strömstad to Nordkoster (35 min) and Sydkoster (45 min). \n\n#### Stay overnight\nTwo hotels on Sydkoster, and many in places in Strömstad. Camping allowed on several spots around the park. \n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Tresticklans nationalpark\nNear Norwegian border. The biggest roadless and undeveloped (obebyggd) forest area in Southern Sweden. Untouched wilderness. Marshland, \n\n#### Good to know\n- 90 bigger and smaller lakes\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain from Gothenburg to Ed (1h17min). Then bus line 764 from Nössemark or Ed goes to Rävmarken a few times a day (weekdays), but has to be pre-ordered. Takes 26 min.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nAllowed to camp. On the Norwegian side there are a few huts in Bodalsviken. Not allowed to light fires (not even grill). \n\n#### Hiking routes\nFrom eastern entrance: Halleleden (4.5 km) that leads to riksgränsen (and further into Norway) - an old trading route. From the main entrance: Tresticklaleden (8 km). Possible to continue from there along Orhöjdsleden (10 km) and further through the Heråmadens naturreservat to Dals-Ed. \n\n\n## Djurö nationalpark\nIslands in Sweden's biggest lake Vänern.\n\n#### Good to know\n- Mostly only accessible with own boat.\n- The smaller islands are protected bird areas and can't be accessed 1 April - 31 July.\n- No possibility to buy food anywhere on the islands.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nPossible to [order boat](https://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/park/djuro-nationalpark/besoksinformation/hitta-hit/) taxis from various places, e.g. Ekenäs. To get to Ekenäs, train to Säffle (1h37min from Gothenburg), then bus 808 (55 min). Or from Otterbäcken: train to Skövde (1h from Gothenburg), then bus 1 (51 min) to Otterbäcken via Mariestad.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamping allowed, but not in bird protection areas. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nOne marked route around the main island.\n\n\n## Tivedens nationalpark\nForests, huge rocks, lakes. Many different animals, e.g. wolves, elks, beavers, deer, hares, foxes.\n\n#### Good to know\n- Terrain is quite hilly, so wear good shoes. \n- Quite challenging hiking routes, so plan more time than you think (e.g. 4.5 km can easily take 3 hours).\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nHard to reach without a car. Best is probably to go to Karlsborg: Train from Gothenburg to Skövde (1h), then bus 400 (55 min) to Karlsborg. Then taxi (20 min) or walk 4 hours to park entrance. \n\n#### Stay overnight\nAllowed to camp one night at various places. Hostel in Tivdedstorp.\n\n#### Hiking routes\nNine different marked routes. Cycle route LIlla Kungsleden goes through the park. One of the best is Stigmansrundan (4.3 km, 3h). Trehörningsrundan (9.5 km, 5h) goes around the lake and passes all three entrances to the park. \n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.263163092Z","tags":null},"/trips/nationalparks_norrland":{"title":"National parks in Norrland","content":"\n## Abisko nationalpark - norra delen\n- Abisko nationalpark - södra delen\n- Björnlandets nationalpark\n\n## Färnebofjärdens nationalpark\nNear Dala river, wetland, old forests, unusually rich birdlife (\u003e200 species). Meeting point of Southern and Northern Swedish flora and fauna (leafy trees vs. Taiga conifers). Vildmarkskaraktär. Ofta överswämmat. Lövskogar. \n\n#### Good to know\n- **May** is the best month to visit. Nature awakes after winter and birds arrive, mosquitoes still rare. \n- Good to explore by foot, but best is via the water (canoe, kayak). \n- Several times votes as Sweden's best tourist destination.\n- It's allowed to pick berries and mushrooms (for own use).\n- A lot of mosquitoes during the summer.\n- Least visited part is near Tinäset in the Southern part. \n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Stockholm, then Gävle. Bus 49 to **Gysinge** (=main entrance to national park), takes 1h.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nVarious vandrarhem, värdshus and B\u0026B in **Gysinge**. Also vindskydd and öppna stugor that allow staying overnight for up to 2 nights.\n\n#### Hiking routes\n1 km and 4 km short routes (start at Naturum). 9 km route along Kyrkstigen from Tärnsjö to Skekarsbo (partially outside of national park borders). For a long hike (30 km), start at Gysinge and combine different trails: go to Skekarsbo, follow Kyrkstigen to Tärnsjö, then proceed along Ljusbäcksleden to Östa naturreservat. \n\n## Hamra nationalpark\n\n## Haparanda skärgårds nationalpark\n\n## Muddus-Muttos nationalpark - norra delen\n\n## Muddus-Muttos nationalpark - södra delen\n\n## Padjelanta/Badjelánnda nationalpark\n\n## Pieljekaise nationalpark\n\n## Sareks nationalpark\n\n## Skuleskogens nationalpark\n\n## Sonfjällets nationalpark\n\n## Stora Sjöfallet-Stuor Muorkke nationalpark\n\n## Vadvetjåkka nationalpark","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.263163092Z","tags":null},"/trips/trips_main":{"title":"Trips","content":"\n## Train journeys\n[Train journey Sweden-Finland](trips/Train%20journey%20Sweden-Finland.md)\n\n\n## National Parks in Sweden\n### [Swedish National Parks](trips/Swedish%20National%20Parks.md)\n#### [Nationalparks Norrland](trips/nationalparks_norrland.md)\n### [Nationalparks Götaland](trips/nationalparks_götaland.md)\n\n\n\n\n## Destinations\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T18:50:42.263163092Z","tags":null}}
