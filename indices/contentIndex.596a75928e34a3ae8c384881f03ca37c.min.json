I never understand how these two are mutually exclusive, and why people argue about what is more important. **They are both equally important and don't work without the other!** \n\nPersonal action is often regarded as having too little or even no impact. But that argument seems to be a way for people to absolving themselves from responsibility and power. Often grounded in envy, greed and self-defence - Why should _I_ stop flying when there are billionaires flying to space? Why should _I_ feel bad about eating meat when this guy over there is eating double my portion? - things that are (unfortunatley) deeply human. And I can totally understand it, because I'm not immune to these thoughts either. It's not nice to on one hand become aware of your bad impact on the environment, feel like you want to change it, feel guilty about things that you can't or don't want to change, and then see others not care while you try to make an effort. \n\nThe way out of this (at least for me) is to reframe these personal actions as something positive. Not consuming so much has had a very calming effect on life in general (is shopping really fun?). It's cheaper, and not accumulating so many things is quite relieving. Eating vegan and vegetarian has improved my cooking, made me more curious about ingredients and other cuisines, and it's (usually) healthier. Not owning a car is another huge reliever of the stress that road rage, parking problems, traffic jams, accidents, repairs etc. would cause. I LOVE my calm train commute where I can read a book or look out the window.  \n\nAnd as an argument for people still insisting that personal action won't change a thing: Industries have forever figured out that tiny actions have a HUGE impact! The famous example of airlines reducing the number or even the [weight of paper](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-travel-briefcase-united-inflight-magazine-20180120-story.html) of in-flight magazines cuts litterally _millions_ of liters of fuel every year. I work in a big food company - just reducing some heating process by _one degree_ in the factory has an enormous impact on energy consumption as well as some knock-on effects like less wear on heat exchangers (i.e. cost savings), less need for harsh cleaning materials (i.e. positive for the environment), etc. It's so short-sighted to think that none of us individuals has an impact. \n\n----\n\nHere's another article that argues that personal action doesn't have much impact and that people shouldn't be too preachy about it: https://medianism.org/2022/08/15/you-cant-get-no-satisfaction-from-reducing-your-own-personal-carbon-footprint/\n\nI do agree with the premise: \n\u003eBeing self-righteous about your own personal actions against climate change can make other people feel inferior and cause them to reject the entire idea. \n\n\u003eOur most important job as environmentalists is to convince the people who haven't yet been convinced that we should do anything at all.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that working on reducing your own personal footprint is pointless. Sure, it's much more important to work on collective reduction in carbon emissions than to fret about a piece of cheese you ate or a pair of trousers you bought, but who if not WE AS CONSUMERS should stop consuming? Fewer things being needlessly produced, fewer things being shipped around the planet, fewer things ending up in landfills and oceans. \nIt's always presented as such a sacrifice, but I think many people (in rich countries) could live an equally happy, if not happier, life if their focus wasn't so much on accumulating things and spending money on status symbols. \n\nThe more interesting point in this article is:\n\u003e There is an asymmetry between the efforts of climate-change environmentalists versus big carbon. Environmentalists spend a lot of our moral resources to increase our personal moral purity and reduce our individual carbon footprint. On the other side of the political divide, big carbon doesn’t waste any resources on personal moral purity and so they can devote all their resources to influence the public sphere to stop policies that would actually make a difference.\n\nNot so much the thing about personal moral purity etc. (the article spends far too much space painting environmentalists as these ultra-preachy people who feel superior). But the idea that industries (oil, plastic, sugar, cigarettes, cars, etc.) encourage putting the onus on individual people as a distraction, while spending their time and power on influencing policies and politics.\n\nIt's not a strategy that environmentalists should or could adopt - Big Oil makes a LOT of money and has interest in making even more, on the other hand environmentalists are not driven by profit and can't (and shouldn't) offer the same incentives to (corrupt) politicians as oil lobbyists do. But it's important to identify these strategies and **call companies out** on them. Investigate, reveal, explain, publicize. \n\nOverall, I agree that if you want to have maximum positive effect on the climate, it's much better to **look for actions with the most impact**, participate in organisations and events, be vocal about climate change and be inclusive and not alienating about it, than to _just_ reduce your own personal carbon footprint. \nBut again, how is anything supposed to change if no one is making ANY change? Many drops make an ocean. We need both - personal action and collective action. One doesn't work without the other, it's a chicken and egg problem. \n\n## Actions\n- Find impactful and public climate actions (including: donate to and support the actions that have the most impact). \n- Be vocal about participating in (fun) climate actions.\n- Show the upsides of leading a low-carbon life style. It's not a sacrifice: not owning a car is freedom; train travel is fun, cheap and fast; repairing clothes is often more rewarding than buying  new ones; vegan food is delicious and healthy; hobbies don't have to cost money or be based on consumption.\n- Expose industries for their distracting actions as well as their damaging actions (car companies producing ever bigger cars and marketing them as FREEDOM; companies implementing distracting \"skip the straw\" initatives [while collaborating with oil industry](https://logicmag.io/nature/oil-is-the-new-data/), etc.).\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:19.521885855Z","tags":null},"/climate/climate_main":{"title":"Environment \u0026 climate action","content":"\nThoughts on [personal action](climate/Personal%20action.md)\n\n\n### Reading list\n[How we will fight climate change](climate/How%20we%20will%20fight%20climate%20change.md)\n\n[[climate/Oil is the new data]]\n\n[[How to blow up a pipeline]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:19.521885855Z","tags":null},"/content/projects":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:19.521885855Z","tags":null},"/fungi/Episode-1-Fungi":{"title":"Episode 1 - Fungi?","content":"\n_30 November 2020_\n\n## EPISODE 1 - FUNGI?\n\n### Breathe in - breathe out.\n\nImagine you’re in a forest. The sun trickles through the dense canopy of tall trees above you. You’re surrounded by plants and animals - birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking, leaves rustling, insects crawling. But there is another inhabitant in the forest, neither plant nor animal. It permeates the soft and bouncy soil under your feet with long, thin filaments, entangled and growing in all directions, decomposing dead wood into nutrients, nurturing tree roots. Here and there you can see a trace of this inhabitant, in the form of a shiny hat atop a delicate stem, a thick white wedge growing from the side of a tree trunk, or a velvet blanket covering a decaying fruit. Welcome to the world of fungi.\n\n---\n\nFungi are a vital part of our ecosystems, often called the “recyclers of Nature”. But what exactly are these enigmatic lifeforms? They contribute to our lives in a myriad of ways, synthesizing antibiotics, acids and cholesterol medication, producing food and drinks, growing into furniture, insulation and clothes, cleaning water and decontaminating soil… Just like they permeate the forest floor, they permeate society, but still many people know very little about them. Most just view the creeping growth of mould as repulsive and disgusting, a sign of spoilage (though if watched closely, [a quite beautiful one](https://vimeo.com/454729694?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-1-fungi)).\n\nIn this newsletter, I want to offer a different perspective. I’ll tell you stories where the fungi are the heroes. Fungi are a true cornerstone of our civilization, they deserve a place in the spotlight. 10 carefully selected topics will highlight the surprising and exciting ways in which fungi and fungal technology have changed, are changing, and will change our world.\n\n![Pleurotus mycelium on coffee grounds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Mycelium_RH_%288%29.jpg)\n\n### So what are fungi?\n\n\u003e “Fungi are diverse and often flexible, and they live in many places, ranging from ocean currents to toenails.” [1]\n\nFungi are neither bacteria, nor plant nor animal. But they share characteristics with all of these kingdoms, stretching conventional classification systems in a lot of ways.\n\nLike bacteria, they can be classed as microorganisms—and some fungi do exist as microscopic single cells (yeasts). Most, however, exist as multicellular organisms—assembling into branching structures that cover centimetres or even metres in diameter.\n\nLike plants, fungi can form different tissues and organs, and produce seed-like spores to spread. But unlike trees and flowers and algae, fungi don’t rely on sunlight to grow, and their cell walls don’t contain cellulose. Even so, until the middle of the 20th century, fungi were considered to be part of the plant kingdom and it was only after genetic analyses that we were able to determine for certain that they are actually related more closely to animals than to plants.\n\nLike animals, fungi constantly need to find organic material to consume to stay alive. Animals usually do this by digesting food inside their bodies while fungi secrete digestive enzymes outside their bodies, directly onto their food, to break it down and then absorb this soup of nutrients. Animals usually move around, while fungi instead reach and grow in different directions (usually towards a food source).\n\nMost fungi I will write about grow into vast networks (these are called “filamentous fungi”, or moulds), but I will occasionally mention and even dedicate a whole chapter to fungi that stay as single cells throughout their lives: the yeasts. Similarly, mushrooms will be mentioned at times, but there is a difference between fungi and mushrooms. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of some fungi, but not all fungi form mushrooms.\n\n\u003e “A mushroom is not a self-contained organism, like a jellyfish, for example. It is a reproductive organ produced by a colony, or mycelium, which grows in soil or rotting wood. For convenience, we use the term ‘mushroom’ rather than ‘mushroom-forming fungus’ to describe the whole organism, although this is a bit like using a photograph of a large pair of testicles to represent an elephant.” [2]\n\n![Oyster mushrooms](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/15/18/10/fungi-2069474_1280.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### Growing in networks\n\nThe life of a filamentous fungus starts with a tiny spore, just a few micrometers in size, falling onto humid soil or a juicy fruit lying on the ground. The spore germinates and grows into a network of fine thread-like filaments (hyphae) that spread out and form the mycelium, a network of cells working together for survival, growing through organic matter, soil, wood and decaying leaves. Individual hyphae can only be seen under the microscope, but the mycelium as a whole grows into a large fluffy mass that is visible to the naked eye (like on that orange you forgot in the fruit basket).\n\nNutrients direct this growth, with the filaments acting as fine probing sensors that test the surrounding space and grow in whichever direction the conditions are more favourable. As they grow, the far tips of the filaments secrete enzymes into their environment that break down organic material into simple sugars, which are then taken up by the fungal cells and shared among the whole mycelium network.\n\n\u003e “If you could make the soil liquid and transparent and walk into the ground, you would find yourself surrounded by the nets of fungal hyphae.” [1]\n\n![Mycelium growth simulation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Mycelium_growth_simulation.gif)\n\n---\n\nThat’s as much fungal biology as you need to know for now, but it is important to set the scene for the three characteristics that are most important for understanding how humans use fungi:\n\n-   the growth into a dense network\n-   the ability to produce enzymes and other substances and release them into their surroundings\n-   and the ability to grow on a wide range of different things, many of which we consider waste.\n\nFungi are found almost everywhere on Earth - in soil, water, air, and on and inside other organisms. Recent estimates suggest that there are up to 3.8 million different species of fungi, of which only 120 000 have been formally recognised, and only 35 000 named [3]. This means 97% of fungi are still waiting to be found, and most of those are in tropical parts of the world where species diversity is higher.\n\nThere are already a dizzying variety of fungi and mushrooms that have proven or supposed medicinal effects, can be eaten or are used for industrial processes. Imagine how many there are yet to be found. So let’s get to it.\n\n_In the next episode:_ **_Turning starch into protein. Eating mould. The history of Quorn.

Credit: Silvia Hüttner._\n\nBeer, cheese, bread, soy sauce… All of the intentional uses of fungi in food production once started as accidental discoveries, with spores delivered by wind, hands, grains and fruits. These discoveries happened centuries, or even millennia, ago. But there is one recent example where the use of a fungus to produce a new food product was actually the result of rational planning and careful screening of suitable strains. This lab-based approach resulted in what was called by its inventor “the first new food since the potato”.\n\n## Turning starch into protein\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, many scientists as well as UN agencies warned that the world would soon run out of protein. Fears that animal products alone could not feed Earth’s growing population, and would cause famines and malnourishment, spurred research into alternative sources. It wasn’t long before food scientists started to turn to microorganisms for nutrition. Fungi and bacteria have the advantage of growing very efficiently under simple conditions. Most of them need just sugar, nitrogen, phosphorus and some minerals to grow and grow and grow and grow, doubling in number in as little as half an hour. Inside their cells they turn the nutrients they’ve taken up into edible protein, much more efficiently than any cow or chicken could ever do. This seemed like a perfect way to produce protein at a large scale.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3osxYeymtCD76SeQjC/giphy.gif)\n\n_Animation of bacteria growing and dividing. Credit: Giphy_\n\nAs a large cereal producer, British food conglomerate Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) had a lot of starch left over and started looking into ways to turn this abundant carbohydrate-rich byproduct into more sought-after protein. They collected over 3000 samples of filamentous fungi from all over the world to identify a strain that was safe to eat, would have a pleasant flavour and texture, and grew well on starch or sugar under laboratory and industrial conditions. The almost-too-good-to-be true story is, that despite combing the entire planet, the researchers eventually struck gold in 1967 in a field just a stone’s throw away from the RHM Technology Research Centre in Buckinghamshire, UK. The soil fungus they found, _Fusarium venenatum_, subsequently became the now hundred-million-dollar brand Quorn.\n\nTurning a soil fungus into a new food product took Quorn many years of research, feeding trials in 12 animal species, and food safety assessments that included a two million word report on toxicology to get approval from the authorities. It also took time and money to develop and optimise the necessary large-scale production equipment to grow the fungus and turn it into food. But in 1985, this work was finally complete and Quorn launched on British supermarket shelves bearing the name “mycoprotein” (from myco = Greek for fungus) in the form of mince, “chicken” filets, sausages, and more. In the 35 years since, Quorn has gradually expanded into other countries. Occasionally, the brand faced some resistance on introduction, such as in the US where they were accused of [mislabelling](https://www.wired.com/2002/04/a-mushrooming-quorn-controversy/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) the products as “mushroom-based” (they now mention “mould” on their labels, as well as possible cross-reactions from people allergic to mould). Today Quorn is available in 14 countries worldwide.\n\n![](https://images.ctfassets.net/uexfe9h31g3m/38d4Fi2mtGKqsIA28YKGow/a136af0e6910ef10caf82a7d2d931096/Quorn_Thai_Sticky_Fillets.jpg?w=1024\u0026h=576\u0026fm=webp\u0026fit=thumb\u0026q=90)  \n_“Chicken” filet from Quorn UK’s recipe website. Credit: Quorn_\n\n---\n\n## How is mycoprotein made?\n\nMycoprotein, like Quorn, is made in large, up to 40-metre tall, stainless steel tanks (called bioreactors) that keep a mixture of sugar, water and some minerals at a certain temperature. Air is bubbled through the liquid, mixing it and saturating it with oxygen. Into this nutrient jacuzzi, a small volume of fungi starter culture is added, in a sterile way to make sure that nothing else but the specific fungal strain grows inside the tank. The fungal cells, surrounded by the most ideal conditions they could hope for, happily start to grow and divide, soon forming thick, fluffy clumps of mycelium that have a consistency somewhere between applesauce and wet cotton. If no more nutrients are added, the mycelium grows until all available sugar in the liquid is consumed and the whole process is completed in less than 24h.\n\nThe mycelium, aka the mycoprotein, can then be harvested by separating it from the liquid. The doughy mass of beige mycoprotein coming out of the bioreactor is surprisingly meat-like, since the fine, intertwined filaments of the mycelium resemble muscle fibres and give the product a chewy texture. Mycoprotein is high in protein and fibre content, and very low in fat and sugar. And what does it taste like? If you expect an aromatic mushroom-like taste you might be disappointed to learn that it doesn’t really taste of anything much. On the other hand, if you’re a food company looking for an easy meat replacement, you’re probably thrilled by this fact.\n\nQuorn runs a continuous process, where grown mycelium is removed from the tank and fresh sugar-water is added at all times, keeping a steady stream of nutrients and space for new mycelium to grow [1]. In this way, a single process can run for up to six weeks churning out hundreds of kilos of mycoprotein per hour. Compare that to the time it takes for a cow to grow from conception to slaughterhouse, and it’s clear to see why mycoprotein production is such an incredibly efficient way to produce protein.\n\n_Side note: This way of growing microorganisms is either referred to as cultivation or fermentation. In a biochemistry-strict sense, fermentation only happens in the absence of oxygen, though the term has become somewhat looser in food production._\n\n---\n\n## Finnish mycoprotein\n\nAround the same time that Quorn was created in the UK, and prompted by the same motivations to increase worldwide protein production, a similar process was developed further North, with a very different outcome.\n\nFinland’s forest cover is more extensive than that of any other European country, about 76% of the land is covered with trees. Naturally, pulp and paper production has been a very important industry for centuries, and the pulp mills dotting the landscape churn out not only paper but also large amounts of waste streams containing water, acids, other chemicals, and cellulose. As you can witness in a forest, many fungi can grow on wood and consume the sugars in the wood cellulose as food. Therefore, researchers in the 1960s looked into the possibility of using the cellulose-containing waste streams in paper mills as a nutrient source for growing fungi. Hundreds of strains were tested and one was identified as suitable to grow on these waste streams and produce high amounts of protein-rich mycelium.\n\nThe process was named Pekilo process, after the fungus they used, _Paecilomyces variotii_, and industrial production at two sites in Finland was established. Thousands of tonnes of mycoprotein were produced to be used initially as pig and chicken feed. Researchers also looked into using Pekilo as an ingredient in sausages, meatballs [2] and bread [3]. However, after only a decade, production of Pekilo protein was stopped and it never made it onto supermarket shelves. Why? New developments in the paper pulping process had led to changes in the waste stream composition, and at the same time interest in Pekilo protein decreased. The last Pekilo plant in Mänttä closed in 1992.\n\n---\n\n## Quorn’s competitors\n\nBy the 1980s, fears of the “World Protein Gap” had faded and been [debunked](https://theconversation.com/the-protein-gap-nutritional-sciences-biggest-error-76202?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds). In the 90s, Pekilo research was put into a filing cupboard, and Quorn - though successful - remained a niche product for vegetarians for most of the late 20th and early 21st century. All the while humanity continued to [increase its taste for animal protein](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) and found ever more ways to erode ecosystems and animal welfare through factory farming and feed plantations.\n\nIn recent years, however, due to greater awareness of the negative impact of meat production on the environment and meat consumption on personal health, sales of plant-based alternatives have grown enormously. Virtually every large food producer has soy, pea or gluten protein products on the market today. But when it comes to mycoprotein, Quorn is still the only option on supermarket shelves.\n\nThere are several possible reasons why other companies are still hesitant to make food from mycelium. The first is lack of expertise, as fungi cultivation and mycoprotein production require a very specific set of skills not traditionally found in the food industry. Another is concern that the association with mould could be a turn-off for consumers. There can also be considerable regulatory hurdles when it comes to using new ingredients in food - remember, it took Quorn a long time and a lot of money to get their mycoprotein approved. Finally, there’s the simple calculation that investing in very expensive and specialised equipment may just not be worth it when new alternative-meat products created with known ingredients (soy etc.) are performing so well.\n\nThings are beginning to change, however. The need for greener food production is more pressing than ever, consumers are starting to crave new products (and are often willing to pay a higher price for them), and the boom in microbreweries has shown that it’s feasible to start successful fermentation businesses even if you’re not a multinational corporation. Not unimportantly as well, many of Quorn’s initial patents recently expired, making it possible to “copy” their process, and you can even order the Quorn strain [from a culture collection](https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/products/all/20334?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds).\n\nSeveral small companies have popped up in the last couple of years that promise an updated, 21st-century version of how mycoprotein can help feed (and save) the world. They mostly focus on the prospective immense savings of water, land area, time and greenhouse gas emissions that can be achieved when comparing the production of a kilo of mycoprotein to a kilo of meat, as well as the advantages of mycoprotein over plant-based alternatives. Mycoprotein has a better [nutritional profile](https://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Fulltext/2019/01000/Mycoprotein__Nutritional_and_Health_Properties.4.aspx?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) than many plant proteins, offers a better (meaning in this case more meat-like) texture and can be grown faster on less land than most plants.\n\nTo differentiate themselves from Quorn, these companies innovate on different aspects of the production process. Some have developed new ways of growing fungi and cultivate the mycelium not submerged in liquid but instead in [thick](https://www.atlastfood.co/method?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) [fluffy](https://www.naturesfynd.com/fy-protein?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) layers, that already resemble a meat-like structure.

Tanks for mycoprotein production can be made in any size, and with some clever engineering, personal myco-fermenters could soon be a [normal appliance](https://www.kernel.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) in our homes. Or, if not in our homes, then a decentralised food production system could be envisioned, where villages or communities might manufacture their own mycoprotein. Similarly, mycoprotein production could happen at many different sites in connection with other industries that produce suitable side-streams which are then directly fed into the fungi cultivation tanks, as pioneered by the Pekilo process.\n\nSince the fungal growth process happens in a controlled, sealed-off environment, this type of food production is largely independent of weather, climate or soil conditions and can therefore happen in places where normal agriculture is impossible (and increasingly more impossible due to climate change). Of course, the need for clean water and electricity for the fermentation present a challenge, but one that will hopefully be solved in the near future by improved production processes (e.g. water recycling) and [better availability of solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) and wind power. Currently, the carbon footprint of mycoprotein is still slightly worse than that of plant proteins or even chicken [4], mostly because of the high electricity demand of heating, cooling, stirring and aerating the bioreactors. And while chicken farming is certainly not great for chickens, its greenhouse gas emissions are actually relatively low compared to other meats (such as beef). But mycoprotein production is already a clear winner in some aspects, such as water pollution (no manure runoff into waterways!) or land use.\n\nWhat about lab-grown meat? In the last few years it has attracted a lot of attention and investment and has, like mycoprotein, been touted as a “game changer” for more sustainable food production. Unfortunately, the animal cells that are used for lab-grown meat are more delicate and fussy than fungi cells, grow slower and require more complicated bioreactor setups and conditions (e.g. scaffolds, vitamins, growth factors). Lab-grown meat has still not been produced at large scale, while mycoprotein is actually a comparatively [mature technology](http://fafdl.org/blog/2019/08/01/why-cultured-meat-will-not-feed-the-world-but-mycoprotein-just-might/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds). At the time of writing, it’s [questionable](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03448-1?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-2-eating-moulds) if lab-grown meat will ever live up to its promises of being a more sustainable meat alternative [5].\n\nEither way, for some people, growing our food in temperature-controlled tanks might be a step too futuristic or “unnatural”. But if it means drastically reducing the environmental impact, not slaughtering billions of animals on a daily basis and being able to produce tasty and nutritious food in a reliable manner, it’s perhaps worth revisiting those reservations.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode: **Fungi as materials.

Also called tinder mushroom, it was also a popular flammable substance and even [Ötzi the Iceman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) had some of it in his pockets when he was crossing the Alps.\n\nAmadou was for a long time the only fungi-based material in common use, but this is about to change. In the last ten years, materials made with or from fungi have started to pop up in design and art magazines, as chairs, lampshades or wallets or even as whole buildings. So far mostly used as concept pieces or promotional material from design studies, fungi products might finally go mainstream in 2021. The New York Times [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) about fungi being _“fall’s hottest fashion trend”_ and Adidas very recently [announced](https://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2020/adidas-2021-first-time-more-60-percent-all-products-will-be-made/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) the development of “a new material, a purely biological leather alternative made from mycelium” that they will use “for the very first time in the creation of footwear”. It’s not that often that people get excited about fungi on their feet.\n\nSo let’s look into what kind of fungi materials there are, how to make them, and why they’re exciting. We’ll start with leather.\n\n## Mycelium leather\n\n\u003e “There are traditionally two ways to make a leather jacket. One involves a cow, and takes years. Another involves synthetic fabric, and requires plastic. But there’s a third option: thick sheets of woven fungus, grown over a couple of weeks on anything from sawdust to agricultural waste.” ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/science/fungus-leather.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nRemember how mycoprotein is made in big vats for food, as described in [Episode 2](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)? You can make fungal leather in much the same way - where the fibrous mycelium pulp is pressed into sheets like paper pulp in traditional paper-making.\n\nMore commonly though, fungal leather is obtained by solid state fermentation, meaning that the mycelium grows in mats on a bed of nutritious solid particles, often agricultural waste, such as straw or sawdust. This is less energy-intensive than liquid cultivation, and also allows the mycelium to grow in its naturally self-assembling, three-dimensional structure, which is important for the texture and durability of the resulting material.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0YiVsb.jpg) _Pressed and dried mycelium mats (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\nSome species are more suitable than others [1]. The fungi used for this process are usually of the mushroom-forming variety (basidiomycetes), therefore the growth conditions have to be adjusted carefully to suppress mushroom formation and get only the desired dense mats of mycelium. Indonesia-based Mycotech - who launched [fungi sneakers and wallets](https://www.store.mycl.bio/product-page/bro-do-x-mylea-better-shoes?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in 2019 - experimented first with the common oyster mushroom, before [switching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykWIACD6u8E\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) to Ganoderma (also called Lingzhi or Reishi) because it gave better results. Generally, [polypores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) - which you can often find on the side of tree trunks - are used for creating fungi materials, because they grow in a denser structure than other fungal species.\n\nAfter 5-10 days of growth, the mat of interwoven mycelium is harvested, pressed and dried to obtain a material that is already surprisingly leather-like. It doesn’t need a full-on tanning process like animal leather, though some chemical treatment is necessary to make it more resilient and improve its properties. Soaking in glycerol increases elasticity and strength [2] and immersing in acid or alcohol removes undesired soluble components and results in crosslinking, which gives the material additional strength and durability. Bleaching or treatment to eliminate odour might also be necessary. After that, the fungal material is pressed and dried, and dyed or imprinted if desired. The result is a material with a nice organic texture, velvety and soft to the touch, a bit like stroking a dry camembert.\n\nDespite not being a completely chemical-free process, production of fungal leather has a much lower environmental impact than animal leather or conventional synthetic leather, which is [made from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_leather?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#Environmental_impact) petroleum-based PVC. A big advantage is also that the mycelium mats can be grown to sizes of several square metres and to many desired shapes or thicknesses.\n\nBeing a biological growth process, no direct energy input is needed (if grown in solid state fermentation and at ambient temperature). And since the species of fungi used are wood degraders, the growth substrates are typically waste or by-products from forestry and agriculture, or even paper and cardboard, which makes the production process in essence an upcycling process.\n\nConsiderable energy input is however necessary not only for the steps after growth (such as pressing and drying), but also for sterilising the raw materials _before_ the fungi can grow on them. This is usually done with heat and steam, but there are less energy-intensive alternatives such as submerging the raw material in peroxide solution for an hour, or in cold water for a few days.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly for a new technology, cost estimates show that mycelium leather is cheaper to produce than comparable animal or synthetic leather varieties [3], since the raw materials cost next to nothing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e1INe92.jpeg) _Mycelium leather samples (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\nSo what are the difficulties in making fungi leather? In an environment where the raw material is literally agricultural waste teeming with thousands of organisms, contamination is one of the biggest issues manufacturers are facing. Even with rigorous sterilisation and cleaning procedures, it’s tricky to avoid other microbes growing alongside the desired fungus, possibly resulting in a damaged product or no product at all.\n\nAnother issue is inconsistency. Biological processes can be finicky, and fungal growth is no exception. Changes in temperature, humidity, substrate composition, time of day, light, CO2 concentration, etc. lead to variations in growth, resulting in products with inconsistent thickness, texture, colour or structure. And customers tend to like consistency.\n\nFungal leather hasn’t been on the market very long yet, so longer-term durability is still unknown. And one of the biggest selling points of fungal leather is also up for discussion: its biodegradability. While pure mycelium can be completely biologically degraded within weeks, polymer composites or coated mycelium materials might not be (and take as long to decompose as the least-biodegradable component in the mix). If fungal leather is mixed too much with other materials, we might end up with the same problem that coated paper and bioplastics face, which is that they are hard or impossible to recycle properly once they reach the end of their life or use.\n\nMycowork’s Reishi (which was presented at [NY fashion week](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/reishi-launch-at-new-york-fashion-week?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in February 2020), for example, incorporates polyester as reinforcement and has a polylactic acid coating, which gives it [higher tear strength and higher flexibility](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/performance-results-q120?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) than even animal leather, but also makes the material hardly biodegradable.\n\n\u003e “In theory, we can grow Reishi in any shape, whether that’s something very large and seamless, or smaller custom shapes that eliminate all the waste associated with cutting a hide. With leather, you’re essentially cutting arbitrary patterns into a cow-shaped hide and so a lot of our brand partners are excited by the fact that Reishi can be grown in any shape–both for the design possibilities that creates and the reduction of waste.” (Matt Scullin, Mycoworks CEO, [Source](https://www.madewithreishi.com/stories/what-a-fashion-insider-wants-to-know-about-reishi?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nMycoworks was founded in 2013 by Sophia Wang and Philip Ross, an artist that has been working with mycelium since the 1990s. The other prominent player in the field is Ecovative, a mycelium materials pioneer that was founded in New York in 2007. Ecovative partnered with Bolt Threads - a biomaterials company also making artificial spider silk by yeast fermentation - to bring the product Mylo to the market (though [not without legal problems](https://dailygazette.com/2019/03/31/green-island-mushroom-tech-firm-exchanges-legal-salvos-with-california-partner/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) along the way). Mylo [debuted](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boltprojects/the-mylo-driver-bag?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in April 2018, and partnerships with Adidas, Lululemon and Stella McCartney promise fungi-based garments in stores in [2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials).\n\nThere are still only a handful of companies developing fungi leather, and most of them have very similar ideas about naming their product: Mylo (Bolt Threads), Mylea (Mycotech), Mylium ([Mylium](https://www.mylium.nl/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)), [MycoFlex](https://ecovativedesign.com/mycoflex?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) (Ecovative), [Pura Flex](http://pura.mogu.bio/project/pural-materials/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) (MOGU), and Reishi (Mycoworks).\n\nGetting your hands on some fungi lederhosen will still take some time though, as most of these companies don’t yet have large scale production. Instead they’re looking for funding (some [through](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boltprojects/the-mylo-driver-bag?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mycotech/the-worlds-first-mushroom-wooden-watch?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)) or have entered exploratory collaborations with designers (as mentioned above).\n\nBut things could change quickly, especially if existing mushroom farms are adapted to become the leather producers of the near future. Already Mylo [is being grown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/mylo-mushroom-leather-adidas-stella-mccartney.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in European warehouses that used to produce mushrooms for the gourmet market.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VvinLLO.jpg) _Fungal mycelium growing in stacked trays (Credit: Bolt Threads)_\n\n---\n\n## Mycelium blocks\n\nLeather is the most fashionable, but certainly not the only material that can be made out of mycelium. Fill some sawdust into a container, add the right kind of fungi spores, wait a few days, and you get a compact block of a natural mycelium composite that is dense, light and surprisingly strong. The mycelium acts like a glue binding the particles together (while also partially digesting them). After baking and killing the living fungi, the material is dry and durable.\n\n![](https://indiebio.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mushroom_brick_mycoworks.jpg) _Mycelium bricks stacked on top of each other (Credit: Mycoworks)_\n\nIf “blocks of light, dense material” remind you of polystyrene, you’re not alone. Several companies have explored the possibilities of making fungi-based packaging to cushion expensive wine bottles or computer parts. Ecovative (with the brand [Mushroom Packaging](https://mushroompackaging.com?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)) licenses its technology of how to grow mycelium in moulds to get the exact right shape and size to snugly hold a product in place. Companies in [New Zealand](https://www.biofab.co.nz/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), the [Netherlands](https://www.grown.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), the [USA](https://www.paradisepackaging.co/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and the [UK](https://www.magicalmushroom.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) use Ecovative’s technology to offer custom-made packaging solutions, including one made of hemp and mycelium that Lush uses to [ship soap](https://www.magicalmushroom.com/casestudies/lush?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials).\n\nHowever, packaging is literally made to be thrown away once you’ve removed the actual product, and so it needs to be a very low-cost product. It’s hard to imagine mycelium foam to be more than a gimmick for high-priced products, since there is already a cheap, widely used, environmentally-friendly solution widely available: paper and cardboard.\n\nOn the other hand, however, fungi-based packaging can be directly made at the farms that produce the primary raw materials, and could offer a more local and low-emission packaging solution that doesn’t require cutting down trees [4]. If that’s enough to compete with existing materials, or if fungi packaging will remain an ultra-niche product, remains to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, fungi’s unique ability to fill and grow into any shape can be used to make more than just throw-away packaging. Italian-based MOGU uses agricultural residues to develop fungi [floor tiles](https://mogu.bio/flooring/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and [acoustic panels](https://mogu.bio/acoustic/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), while Ecovative has made [lampshades](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/lamp-made-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and other interior products from mycelium, and has (together with Ford) explored the use of fungi foams in car doors and car seats. Conveniently, mycelium composites have been found to absorb noise very well, especially the range of car noise (1,000 Hz) and are more fire-resistant and release less smoke than plastic alternatives [5].\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iv54NkeBYrrpMy4eB6aCor8JAGw=/0x0:5616x3744/1820x1213/filters:focal(2359x1423:3257x2321):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55655605/GrowLamp_HangingPendants5.0.jpg) _Lampshades made out of mycelium (Credit: Ecovative)_\n\nFungi can even be used to construct buildings. The construction sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and materials that can be regenerated offer a path to reduce those emissions. Dr. Jan Wurm, director of the international architecture and construction firm Arup, [says](https://mashable.com/video/mycelium-construction-biofabrication-mogu-arup/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) that “we need to use materials that are grown, that are biofabricated”.\n\nFungi to the rescue! Mycelium blocks can be used as cheap and fire-resistant construction and insulation material. Not only are [these materials](https://criticalconcrete.com/building-with-mushrooms/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) biodegradable, but they can also trap more heat than fiberglass insulation, are fireproof, nontoxic, and stronger than concrete relative to its weight [6].\n\nThere are some downsides, of course. Low water resistance can be a problem in construction use, making the material vulnerable to humidity and - ironically - mould. Mycelium material in stable conditions has a lifespan of decades, but when in contact with wet ground it can [start decomposing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q5i9poYc3w\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in a matter of weeks. In that sense, mycelium behaves like untreated softwood. Like wood, the mycelium bricks can be treated with coatings that make them more resilient but might compromise the 100% biodegradability factor. It’s a thorny problem to solve.\n\n\u003e “The future of materials is going to be grown – biofabricated – and mycelium and its extraordinary ability to assemble itself into complex structures is what will enable us to take biofabrication to the next level of performance.” (Eben Bayer, Ecovative CEO, [Source](https://synbiobeta.com/ecovative-announces-mycoflex-tm-the-next-generation-mycelium-biofabrication-platform/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))\n\nNonetheless, there are already buildings in the world made of fungi. The first large-scale structure made from mycelium bricks was the MoMA PS1 Young Architect’s Program’s [winning entry “Hy-Fi”](https://www.archdaily.com/477912/behind-hy-fi-the-entirely-organic-compostable-tower-that-won-moma-ps1-young-architect-s-program-2014?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) in 2014 which was built with material from Ecovative. After the exhibition, the bricks were composted and used as fertiliser.\n\n![](https://www.certifiedenergy.com.au/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/hyfi_01-1.jpg?width=1200\u0026name=hyfi_01-1.jpg) _The “Hy-Fi” structure made out of mycelium bricks (Credit: [The Living New York](http://www.thelivingnewyork.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))_\n\nGoing a step further, the architecture studio Redhouse has designed a whole mushroom-based ecosystem. The studio’s “[BioHAB](https://www.bio-hab.org/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials)” runs as a pilot project in Namibia: an invasive plant species is harvested to be used as a growth substrate for mushrooms that can then be eaten and sold. The leftover mycelium bricks from the mushroom farm are subsequently [used to build houses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsF5L_SjVU\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials). Redhouse has also developed the [Biocycler](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2020/08/magic-mushrooms-turn-construction-waste-into-building-blocks?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), a machine that grinds cellulose-containing construction waste, then re-binds the pieces with fungi and calcite-producing microbes into a new durable material, which is then processed into blocks.\n\nAnother project exploring the possibilities of fungal architecture is the [FUNGAR project](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-future-homes-fungus.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), which not only experiments with building structures out of mycelium, but also integrating living fungi into construction. (More about that in an upcoming episode!)\n\n---\n\n## Special materials\n\nSome more niche applications of fungal material are found in mortuaries. Many fungi are saprobes - or “eaters of the dead”. Artist Jae Rhim Lee took this literally and designed a [burial suit](https://www.ted.com/talks/jae_rhim_lee_my_mushroom_burial_suit?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials#t-145875) that is infused with mushroom spores and mycelium, which can speed up decomposition and help break down the [over 200 toxic chemicals](https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/pdf/FourthReport_UpdatedTables_Feb2015.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) that are found in a human body. For the complete fungi burial experience, Loop of Life offers a [coffin](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/15/first-funeral-living-coffin-made-mushroom-fibre-netherlands?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) made entirely out of mycelium (with technology licensed from Ecovative).\n\nOther emerging applications of fungal material are in the field of biomedical engineering and cell cultivation. The cells used in tissue engineering and lab-grown meat production need a scaffold to grow on. This can be [provided](https://www.excell.bio/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) by the intricate network of mycelium, which is both compatible with cell growth and [edible](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/61cfd1ef-0247-420b-8357-2e7df4405d2c?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials). Additionally, sheets made from mycelium have been shown to improve wound healing [7] and could find applications in medicine.\n\nAs early as in the 1950s, [patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2811442A/en?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) have been granted for including fungi in the papermaking process to improve fire resistance of paper. Newer studies describe nanopaper containing mycelium compounds with uses as specialised membranes, filters and packaging [8].\n\nIt doesn’t stop there. Other applications for mycelium materials include [sound absorbers](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-fungus-absorber.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials) and [ear plugs](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/you-could-soon-be-wearing-earplugs-made-of-fungus?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials), biodegradable floating wetland panels for habitat creation and shoreline protection [9], and rigid mycelium films that can become a replacement for the widely-used plastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [2].\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/558ff614e4b0344a8c4a8f8c/1559319978759-ELDJNT8TI334A7FULJME/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHtg_DnDrK_LBDO9Fa4RYlwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcLthF_aOEGVRewCT7qiippn-XpjDz03HNDv6M8zfeJJLnmbprUkN7GH1n-ZhSY7_i/6c7552cc-3fea-4c19-81bb-f53317fda7b2.jpeg?format=2500w) _Acoustic wall panels from MOGU (Credit: [Luca Alessandrini](http://lucaalessandrini.com/mogu?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-3-fungi-as-materials))_\n\nIn short, there’s still a lot of room for innovation and research when it comes to growing the products of tomorrow. The input influences the outcome; fungi cultivated on one substrate (such as wheat straw) look and feel different than fungi grown on another substrate (such as sawdust). Even sawdust from different kinds of trees can give varying results.\n\nDifferent fungal species can also have vastly different characteristics when it comes to mechanical properties, looks and material behaviour [9]. Getting consistent products at large-scale will be the biggest challenge for mycelium material producers.\n\nThe technology to manufacture fungal materials, especially at a large scale, is still in development. Ecovative first grew mycelium in open trays, but later invented a system where growth takes place in a solid-state bioreactor which supplies air at the right humidity and temperature to the fungi. Currently though, mycelium cultivation is still done mostly manually, without much automation [6]. And, ironically, a lot of plastic is used to make the fungal material, since mycelium bricks are often grown in single-use plastic bags and moulds.\n\nFinding the right customers is another challenge. A lot of the applications of fungal material are in low-price segments, such as packaging or insulation. That’s why at least initially most companies in the area target art galleries, design studios or organisations that want a few expensive statement pieces. To make fungi-based materials affordable for the mass market, economies of scale are needed.\n\nHaving said that, we will certainly also see more fungi furniture, design products and clothes in the future, made by small studios and artisans. The manufacturing process of, for example, mycelium leather is much more accessible than traditional leather making. Growing products our of fungi could become a new craft where artists, small businesses but also commercial mushroom cultivators experiment and develop new ways of using mycelium.\n\n------\n\n_Thanks to Antoni Gandia, R\u0026D Specialist at MOGU and former Research Scientist at Ecovative, for interesting conversations that helped me dig into this rapidly-expanding field._\n\n---\n\n[1] Fungi as source for bio-based materials: A patent review.

It’s been a while. 😊 I started a new job and that took a bit of my time and headspace. In my new job I work a lot with enzymes, which are made by microorganisms, often fungi. So that’s an excellent reason to use this episode of Filaments to dive into the MASSIVE - but to many people unknown - business of enzyme production in filamentous fungi. (If you need a refresher about filamentous fungi (moulds) and their use as food and materials, go [here](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)). Also, this is a fairly long episode, so make yourself a cup of tea, and enjoy. 🍵\n\n---\n\n## EPISODE 4 - Fungal products everywhere, part 1\n\nInspect a package of washing powder and you will likely see some or all of the following ingredients: _Subtilisin, cellulases, mannanases, pectinases, proteases, lipases, amylases._ These are all enzymes - proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions. Enzymes are precision tools that usually do one job, and one job only, and that job is often to chop up longer molecules into smaller ones.\n\nCellulase cuts cellulose - a polymer consisting of long chains of sugar molecules - into smaller pieces. Protease breaks down proteins, lactase cuts the milk sugar lactose into glucose and galactose, and so forth. A lot of the enzymes in detergents break down things that come from food and dirt that might be on our clothes, such as greasy sauces (lipases), fruit juice (pectinases), cake batter and mashed potatoes (amylases) or body fluids (proteases). By enzymatically cutting these substances into smaller components, they are more soluble and more easily removed.\n\n![https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/enzym01.gif](https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/enzym01.gif)\n\n_This is (kind of) how an enzyme works (if it was a person). Credit: [Christian Winter](https://www.biowin.at/all/Diverses/bu5b/stoffwechsel/enzyme/Enzyme.htm?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)_\n\nAlthough enzymes are made by all organisms, including animals and plants, most of those contained in our everyday products and used in industry are produced by microorganisms, i.e. fungi and bacteria (and we obviously focus on fungi here).\n\nFungal enzymes are used in a **_vast_** number of different industries: in agriculture, research and wastewater treatment, in the production of animal feed, pharmaceuticals, alcohol, fuel, juices, beer, bread, dairy products, cleaning products, textiles, leather, sugar, meat and paper, and a lot more. They permeate everyday life to an extent that few people realise.\n\nThe filamentous fungi used for enzyme production are grown in much the same way that filamentous fungi for food production are grown (as described in [Episode 2](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-2-eating-moulds?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)).\n\n---\n\nWalk into the production site of a large-scale enzyme producer such as DSM, Novozymes, BASF or Amano, and you will see huge, several storey-high stainless steel tanks, holding up to 300 000 L of liquid. These fermentation tanks (or bioreactors) are filled with a particular species of fungus that produces the desired enzyme, and a nutrient solution containing mostly sugar or other low-cost carbohydrate source - often from grains - and some salts. The tanks are set to the perfect temperature and pH for the fungus to grow in, big stirrers mix the liquid and make sure everything is well distributed, and air is bubbled through the liquid from the bottom and the sides of the tank to provide necessary oxygen to the fungus.\n\nFungal growth and enzyme production doesn’t _start_ in these enormous tanks, though - it happens in steps. First, fungal cells that are stored at -80C are revived in a petri dish where they grow in a beautiful mould pattern. (_Technically, step 0 would be finding and isolating the fungal strain in nature; we’ll come to that in a future episode_).\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aspergillus_niger_2.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aspergillus_niger_2.jpg) _Step 1 in fungal enzyme production: an Aspergillus niger colony that has been growing in a petri dish (on potato dextrose agar) for 3 days. Source: Wikimedia_\n\nThe freshly grown fungal cells from the petri dish are then transferred to a small bioreactor (several litres) and after a day or so the fungal mycelium has grown into a thick filamentous network of billions of interconnected cells, and is ready to be transferred to a larger tank (several hundred litres). There it grows for another day, continuously increasing in mass, until the mycelium is finally transferred to the big main tank where the cells continue to multiply and multiply over several days. The reason for this stepwise process is that the requirements for healthy growth as well as the risk of contamination by other microorganisms can be much better controlled this way.\n\nDuring this multiplication and growth process, the enzymes (the actual products here), are produced by the fungal cells in the tank and continuously secreted into the liquid. The more fungal cells there are, the more enzymes are made and released into the liquid, until the billions of fungal cells in the tank are surrounded by a soup of trillions of nanometre-sized enzymes. All this takes just a few days, and in those few days the slurry of enzymes and fungal mycelium gets thicker and thicker.\n\n![https://www.brain-biotech.com/content/images/News/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Feed-Tanks.jpg](https://www.brain-biotech.com/content/images/News/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Feed-Tanks.jpg) _Step 4 in fungal enzyme production: the main fermentation tanks can hold up to several hundred thousand liters. Source: [BRAIN Biotech](https://www.brain-biotech.com/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)._\n\nAll that’s left to do then is to separate the enzymes from everything else in the tank. But first, let’s talk about where the **fungi** - the stars of the process - actually come from.\n\n---\n\nIn the wild, many fungi have evolved to secrete digestive enzymes which break down plant matter into nutrients that the fungus can take up easily. Usually fungi secrete a whole cocktail of different enzymes, each with a very specific function. In an industrial process, however, we usually only want to produce _one_ kind of enzyme. So how do we do that?\n\nWell, it turns out that the nutrient source, pH, aeration, and salt and mineral additions and concentrations, etc. all influence what kinds of enzymes a fungus produces. Modern fermentation technology is a highly controlled process and has become so optimised that - if everything runs smoothly - the fungus will produce little else than one particular target enzyme.\n\nAnd of course the type of fungus plays a huge role as well. The workhorses of enzyme production haven’t actually changed much over the last century, and are _Aspergillus niger_, _Aspergillus oryzae_ and _Trichoderma reesei_.\n\n_[A.niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1)_ is the fungus that causes black mould on fruits and vegetables (niger means black in Latin) and is used in a wide range of industrial processes, mostly in enzyme and acid production. _A. niger_ makes different amylases - enzymes that break down starch - which are used for example in beer brewing (to improve the malting) and baking (to make fluffier bread). _A. niger_ also makes glucose oxidase, an enzyme found in biosensors such as blood glucose test kits for diabetes and other clinical applications.\n\nThe other Aspergillus, _A. oryzae_, is also called koji in Japanese and has been used for centuries in Southern and Eastern Asia to make fermented rice, barley and soy products like sake, soy sauce and miso. It’s still used for these purposes, as well as in many other areas, because of its natural capacity to secrete large amounts of different starch- and protein-degrading enzymes.\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Aspergillus_oryzae_%28%E9%BA%B9%29.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Aspergillus_oryzae_%28%E9%BA%B9%29.jpg) _Aspergillus oryzae growing on rice for the production of miso. Source. Wikimedia._\n\nFinally, _T. reesei_ is mostly used in biofuel production, since it produces enzymes that break down cellulose and other plant polymers to sugar that can then be converted to ethanol in a yeast fermentation process. The original _T. reesei_ strain was [isolated](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5134823?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) during WW2 as the cause for rotting (i.e. “eating”) the tents and clothes of US Army soldiers stationed on the Solomon Islands. Today its enzymes are, besides biofuel production, also used to give [stone-washed jeans](https://www.worldofchemicals.com/527/chemistry-articles/why-cellulase-important-in-stone-washing.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) their distressed look and they’re added to washing powder to remove loose fibres that can cause [textile pilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(textile)?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1).\n\n---\n\nTo achieve an even higher purity or higher concentration of _one particular_ kind of enzyme in production processes, most enzyme companies also use genetically engineered fungal strains (as opposed to so-called “wild-type” or “classical” strains). Again, Aspergillus is a popular choice, because it grows well, is safe to use and there is more than a hundred years of scientific literature available about it. The gene for a specific enzyme can be inserted several times into the host genome, thereby drastically increasing the production of enzyme per cell. In addition, the enzymes themselves can also be further optimised through biotechnological tools. By carefully adjusting the protein sequence of an enzyme it can for example become more resistant to high temperatures.\n\nGenes from other organisms can also be inserted into the Aspergillus genome, which makes it possible to produce enzymes that this fungus originally wouldn’t be able to make. Let’s take an example. [Rennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) (or more specifically the protease enzyme chymosin) is a crucial component of cheese production, and was originally extracted from the stomachs of slaughtered calves. This quite wasteful and cruel practice became obsolete when scientists managed to insert the gene coding for the rennet enzyme into the genome of a fungus. So nowadays, [more than 90%](https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(17)31054-8/fulltext?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) of cheese produced worldwide uses [chymosin](https://www.chr-hansen.com/en/food-cultures-and-enzymes/cheese/cards/product-cards/chy-max-products?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1) made by a genetically-engineered organism, often a strain of _Aspergillus niger_. Compared to the traditional way of rennet production, this reduces cruelty, cost, carbon emissions and pollution in the process.\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Cheese.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Cheese.jpg) _Cheese, likely made using fermentation-produced chymosin. Source: Wikimedia._\n\nMost enzyme companies on the market offer both “classical” enzymes, for users that prefer non-GMO-derived ingredients, as well as enzymes that have been engineered and/or have been produced in GMOs. Just to clarify, however: while “classical” enzymes don’t come from fungal strains that have been changed with _modern_ biotech methods, i.e. genetic engineering, they still have been optimised over the years by “classical” methods. Usually numerous rounds of random mutation (for example by exposing the fungi to gamma-radiation or DNA-altering chemicals) and selection of the best-performing strains, until desirable traits are achieved (similar to plant breeding). Their cousins in the wild would probably not recognise them any more, and the industrial strains would not survive long without their precisely adjusted cultivation conditions.\n\n---\n\nAs mentioned above, enzymes are used in a wide range of industries and products. But why are they still relatively unknown as ingredients? Well, because they are not exactly ingredients. One of the reasons that enzymes fly under the radar, particularly in food products, is that enzymes are considered processing aids and therefore are not declared on the ingredients list on the package. One single enzyme molecule can catalyse the same chemical reaction millions of times, and so a little goes a long way, and most products only need the addition of minute amounts of enzymes (less than one gram of enzyme per ton of raw material). Furthermore, enzymes only work when the right conditions are provided. As soon as the temperature is sliiightly too high, the enzyme is irreversibly destroyed. When food is heat-treated to kill off any microorganisms in the product, the enzymes added during production are taken care of at the same time.\n\n---\n\nSo back to the process of enzyme production by fungi: what happens to the fungi after they’ve fulfilled their job as enzyme producers? After a few days of happy growth and enzyme secretion in the fermentation tank, all available nutrients in the liquid have been consumed by the fungal cells. The density of mycelium and enzyme has reached a maximum. Now, the fermentation broth is released from the tank and pumped into a large filtration unit where the liquid containing the enzymes is separated from the mycelium, either in a spinning washing machine-like drum, or in big filter presses that squeeze the last bit of liquid out of the mycelium, which at this point resembles wet cotton.\n\nThe liquid is then further concentrated to reduce the volume and finally a thick, viscous, honey-like substance chock-full of enzymes is obtained. This liquid is either shipped to customers directly, or spray-dried to get a fine enzyme powder. For specialised research and medical applications, where purity is a particular concern, an additional purification step removes even the smallest non-enzyme particles in the final product (such as some remaining nutrients, fungal metabolites, etc.).\n\nThe filtered-off fungal mycelium is heated to kill the cells and then dried and milled into a powder. This fungi powder can then be used as animal feed or as fertilizer and spread on fields. So in a nice example of circularity, the nutrients in the fungal cells may help grow the grains that will then again be used as a nutrient source in a future fungi fermentation process.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode, **part 2 of “Fungal products everywhere”** we’ll meet our friend _Aspergillus niger_ again and dive into the acids and pharmaceuticals that fungi make.

Acids, are another one.\n\n**_So today, a story about acids from moulds, lemon shortages, and how it all led to the emergence of today’s biggest pharma companies._**\n\n---\n\n## EPISODE 5 - Fungal products everywhere, part 2\n\nCitric acid is THE example of a bulk chemical that is produced by filamentous fungi. Citric acid is used in many more industries than you can imagine. It’s a common flavour additive in drinks and candy, it’s used as an acidic food preservative, it makes ice cream and cheese creamier, and it provides the fizz in products like bath bombs and effervescent tablets. It’s also used in bathroom and kitchen cleaning products, laundry detergents, cosmetics, and [in anything from heroin to soldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2). More than [two million tonnes](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-citric-acid-markets-report-2011-2018--2019-2024-300814817.html?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) are produced each year, virtually all by fungal fermentation.\n\n![](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/64c38c17-3f4b-4994-8ecb-5999bf0b0e8a.167ac15c41ac895c3c1b9f76232a1890.jpeg?odnWidth=undefined\u0026odnHeight=undefined\u0026odnBg=ffffff) _Source: walmart.com_\n\n---\n\nThis hasn’t always been the case. For a long time, up until the beginning of the 20th century, citric acid was extracted from lemons and limes (hence the name), which contain up to 8% of the substance. Through a tedious process involving adding calcium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, about a kilogram of citric acid could be obtained from 500 lemons.\n\nItaly was, as the main producer of citrus fruits at the time, also the main producer of citric acid. As demand for citric acid grew during the late 1800s, the availability of citrus fruits proved the bottleneck, and the industry was “ripe for [disruption](https://rethinkdisruption.com/citric-acid/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2)”, as we would phrase it nowadays. That disruption came in several steps.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/cFDdEQMGh6UDe/giphy.gif) _Source: giphy.com_\n\n---\n\nFirstly, German chemist and mycologist Carl Wehmer [discovered in the 1890s](https://books.google.se/books?id=fdBMcYg_xGYC\u0026pg=PA140\u0026redir_esc=y\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false) that a specific mould (a filamentous fungus), could produce citric acid when growing on top of a sugar solution. Wehmer called the mould Citromyces (it was later reclassified as Penicillium) and filed a patent for the process in 1893.\n\nMaking citric acid without needing to grow, water and harvest lemons was ground-breaking and hopes were high that this process could work as a replacement. Together with a French textile chemicals company, Wehmer ran trials in large wooden fermentation pans that were stirred by hand. Knowledge about fungal fermentation was still in its early days though, and the fungi often died because they generated more heat during growth than they could tolerate. Nevertheless, the researchers managed to obtain several tens of kilos of citric acid.\n\nHowever, high costs and a lot of problems with contamination by other microbes during cultivation - again, knowledge about microbiology was not so advanced then - limited the success of citric acid production by fungal fermentation. For another while, chemical extraction from lemons and limes seemed much easier and continued to be the method of choice for industrial production.\n\n![](https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0059171/full/1024%2C/0/default.jpg) _Penicillium fungus growing on the surface of a liquid containing nutrients.

Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)._\n\n---\n\nBut more disruption was coming. World War I unsettled the Italian citrus fruit and citric acid exports, and in addition in 1918 the Spanish Flu brought a sudden craze for lemons as a [flu cure](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/foods-that-protect-against-viruses?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2). Prices skyrocketed and a discovery made a few years earlier by American food chemists [Boleslas Zahorski (1913)](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e8/04/a4/05679aaa71d0d7/US1066358.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) and [James Currie (1917)](https://www.jbc.org/content/31/1/15.full.pdf?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) suddenly took centre stage.\n\nTheir inventions described citric acid production that was based on Wehmer’s fermentation method, but instead of Penicillium they used a different fungus - _Aspergillus niger_. They found that this fungus could grow in strongly acidic conditions, while contaminating microbes could not. _A. niger_ also produced more citric acid than Penicillium.\n\n---\n\nA small US chemicals company called Pfizer hired James Currie to develop the citric acid fermentation process further and commercialised production in 1919. It was a huge success and transformed the citric acid industry completely in just a few years. The newly developed production was stable and much more efficient than extraction from fruits. Already by 1930, over 90% of citric acid worldwide was produced with fungi.\n\nThis method remains the preferred approach for citric acid production today (as well as a range of enzymes, as described in [Episode 4](https://buttondown.email/Filaments/archive/episode-4-fungal-products-everywhere-part-1/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2)). But that’s not where its impact ends. The expertise in fermentation technology that Pfizer gained through citric acid production was later applied to the mass production of other chemicals, including antibiotics during WWII, which paved the way for Pfizer to become one of the largest pharma companies in the world.\n\n---\n\nIt took another 40 years and a lot of scientific research (yielding [at least 2 nobel prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#Discovery)) for the exact biochemical pathways of citric acid production inside (fungal) cells to be understood, and it was only then that production conditions could really be optimised in a targeted way. Improving microbial strains and increasing productivity is still a topic of research and of enormous commercial value today.\n\nYou might be curious as to how this is done. The classic approach is to introduce mutations into the fungal genome, often by UV or gamma radiation. Then the resulting mutants are screened to - by chance - find high producers. However, techniques have been developed in the last decades that involve genomic sequencing and inserting or deleting specific genes in a [more intentional way](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-019-1064-6?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2) (as is also done in fungal enzyme production. In this way, strains can be developed that not only produce more product, but can also grow and consume growth materials that were previously unsuitable, such as waste from agriculture.\n\n---\n\nInterestingly, a staggering one million tonnes of fungal biomass are produced each year as a side product from citric acid production alone (as well as over 10 million tonnes of fungal and bacterial biomass from other acid fermentations), making it an undervalued, high-protein resource that could be used in food supplements and food production. Currently, this material is used to feed animals or is spread on fields, but there’s no reason why it couldn’t be more efficiently used as a direct protein source for humans.\n\n---\n\nOh, and if you’re wondering what happened to the less-optimal citric acid production process discovered by Carl Wehmer in the 1890s, then you might be interested to know that it had far greater impact in another industry. While not ideal for Wehmer’s Penicillium mould, lactic acid bacteria thrived [under the conditions provided](https://books.google.se/books?id=fdBMcYg_xGYC\u0026pg=PA140\u0026redir_esc=y\u0026utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false). The lactic acid that these microbes produce is another widely used ingredient in food and pharmaceutical products.\n\nWehmer started work as a consultant for industrial chemical producer Albert Boehringer, and developed his lactic acid production by bacterial fermentation on an industrial scale. The company that Boehringer founded, Boehringer Ingelheim, is today, like Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.\n\n---\n\nIn the next episode, we’ll round up “Fungal products everywhere” with a look at all the medical uses that fungi (can) have. Enjoy the summer! ☀️ If you want to get your vitamin D without exposing yourself too much to the sun, just put some mushrooms out in direct sunlight before you eat them. Similar to animals, they can generate vitamin D in their “skin” (cell wall) [when exposed to UV light](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213178/?utm_source=Filaments\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_campaign=episode-5-fungal-products-everywhere-part-2).

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recommend `[cmd]+T`).

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:19.529885879Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

Then next time when you use it, you can look specific things up._\n\n**When importing modules:** \n\neither\n`import chosen_module`\n`print (chosen_module.sentence)`\n\nor\n`from chosen_module import sentence`\n`print (sentence)`\n\nor\n`import chosen_module as mod`\n`print (mod.sentence)`\n\nE.g. to import and use the Turtle class from the turtle module, either write:\n`import turtle`\n`new_turtle = turtle.Turtle()`\n\nor\n`from turtle import Turtle`\n`new_turtle = Turtle()`\n\nThe latter is useful when the class is used often and you don't want to type `turtle.Turtle()` all the time.\n\nIt's also possible to import everything from a module and use it as if it was part of the normal environment (i.e. without the module name).\n`from turtle import *`\n\nThis however can be confusing, since it's often good to know which module a function belongs to.\n\nE.g.\n`choice([1,3,4])` looks confusing out of context. But if you write `random.choice([1,3,4])` it's much clearer that it is part of the random module and that a random number is picked from this list.\n\nFor long module names, it's also possible to use aliases:\n\n`import turtle as t`\n`new_turtle = t.Turtle()`\n\n### Lists\n**Lists** store data in a specific order\n`fruits = [\"Cherry\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"]`\n\nTo access a specific entry from the list:\n`fruits[0]` or `fruits[-1]`\n\nTo add an item to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append(\"Melon\")`\n\nTo add several times to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append([\"Strawberry\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"]`\n\n`random.choice(list)`\nThis generates a random choice from a given list.\n\n`str.split()`\nSplits a string into separate components based on some defined divider, e.g. a comma.\n\n`str.split(\",\")`\nThe result will be a **list** that contains the separate components of the string.\n\nNested lists contain **lists of lists**. When addressing a specific item in a nested list, you have to first pick the right nested list, then the item in that list, e.g. the first item in the first list would be:\n`print (list([0][0])`\n\nTransform a string into a list:\n`list(string)`\n\n**in**\n\nThe **in** construct is an easy way to test if an element is contained in a collection, e.g. in a list.\n\n`list = [\"Silfa\", \"Duncan\", \"Laika\"]`\n`if \"Silfa\" in list:`\n`    print (\"yay\")`\n\n### Loops\n`letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`   print (letter)``\n\nNB: The item (here `number`) in a for loop does **NOT** count from 0 to i, but instead takes the value of the first item in the list (e.g. `\"a\"`) and takes on that value. This means, that to have some kind of **counting variable** that is first set to 0 (outside the loop) and then increases with each round inside the loop, you have to do the following:\n`count = 0`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`    print (letter)`\n`    count += 1``\nThen with each round through the loop, `count` will increase by 1, and will in the end have the same value as items in `letters`.\n\nFor loops are often used to loop through lists, but you can also loop through ranges of items that are not lists.\n\n**for loops and the** `**range()**` **function**\n\n`for number in range (a, b):`\n`    print (number)`\n_NB: a is included, b is not_\n\nThe step size can also be changed, e.g. to increase the numbers by 3, type:\n`range(1, 100, 3)`\n\n**So there are 2 types of for loops:**\ntype 1\n\n`for item in list _of_items:`\n`    #do something to each item`\n\ntype 2\n`for number in range(a,b):`\n`    #do something``\n\n**_When to use a for and when a while loop?_**\n\n**For** loops are great when you iterate over something, and you want to do something with each thing you iterate over. E.g. iterating through a list.\n\n  \n\n**While** loops are used when you just want to carry out some sort of functionality many times until a condition is met. Don't care about what number in a sequence you're in, which item in a list you're iterating through, etc.\n\nWhile loops are a bit more dangerous than for loops. In for loops you always have an upper bound, but while loops will continue running until the condition evaluates to `FALSE`. That can lead to infinite loops.\n\nA good thing to do when you don't know why you get an infinite loop, simply `print()` the condition inside the loop and check what's happening.\n\n**While loop**\nA loop that keeps on going while a condition is `TRUE`.\n\n`while something_is_true:`\n`    #do a thing, then test the condition again, etc.`\n\nOnce the condition evaluates to FALSE, the while loop is skipped.\n\nExample of how a while loop can be used:\n`count = 6`\n`while count \u003e 0:`\n      `print (\"Hello!\")`\n      `count -= 1   #this decreases the` `number of counts by one every time` `the loop runs`\n  \nWhile loops can also be used while a condition is `FALSE`. For that, use this syntax:\n\n`while not some_condition_that_is_true:`\n`    #do something`\n\nThis means the loop runs while the condition is `FALSE`, but as soon as it evaluates to `TRUE`, we drop out of the loop.\n\nA good way to **include a check in a while loop** is to set a variable to `True` (or `False`) before the while loop starts. Then set the while loop to run WHILE the `variable == True`. Inside the while loop, something makes the variable either remain `True` or switch to `False`. In case of False, the while loop will stop.\n\nA good way to **increase something or build something up in a For loop** is to set an empty string or an empty list outside of the for loop first. Then inside the for loop, in every turn something is added to the string or list, adding up to the final string or list when the for loop is finished.\n\n### Dictionaries\nDictionaries are useful if you want to associate labels with each value. Lists are better if you are storing similar data, such as a list of proces or names, where you cannot label each value.\n\n`dictionary1 = {`\n`   key1: value1,`\n`   key2: value2,`\n`   key3: value3,`\n`   }\n\nTo get a value back:\n`dictionary1[key2]`\n\nTo add an entry to the dictionary:\n`dictionary1[key4] = value4`\n\nSimilar to lists and strings, it's often useful to start with an _empty_ dictionary, and then later on add to the dictionary.\n`dic_new = {}`\n\nWhen looping through a dictionary, usually the **key** will be picked out:\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`   print (key)`\n\nIf you want to access a specific **value** in a dictionary (e.g. when looping through the dictionary):\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`    print (dictionary1[key])``\n\n**Nested dictionaries**\nThe nested dictionaries don't need to be the same size as the outer dictionaries. They can also include lists, strings, numbers, etc.\n\nLists are ordered and are accessed by the position inside the list. Dictionaries are NOT ordered.\n\nDictionaries (or lists) are like folders. They can contain values, but they can also contain other dictionaries (or lists).\n\nA **_dictionary that contains a list_** looks like this:\n\n`travel_log = {`\n`   \"France\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"],`\n`    \"Germany\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n`    }`\n\n  \nA **_dictionary that contains a dictionary_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = {`\n      `\"France\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], \"total_visits\": 12},`\n      `\"Germany\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"], \"total_visits\": 5},`\n`}`\n\nAnd a **_list that contains dictionaries_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = [`\n`{`\n`\"country\": \"France\", `\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], `\n`\"total_visits\": 12,`\n` },`\n` {`\n`\"country\": \"Germany\",`\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n` \"total_visits\": 5,`\n` },`\n` ]`\n\nTo get **values** from a dictionary, type the variable for the dictionary, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[\"name\"]`\n\nTo get the **keys** from a dictionary, you can turn the keys into a list, and then refer to an item in this list. NB: items in a list are ordered, while items in a dictionary are not!\n`keys_list = list(dictionary)`\n\nTo get **values from a dictionary of lists**, type the variable for the dictionary, the index of the entry in question, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[0][\"name\"]`\n\n#### Generate dictionary from a list\nSeveral options:\n- `dict.fromkeys()` Used to create a dictionary from a list. It accepts a list of **keys** that you want to turn into a dictionary. Optionally, you can specify a value you want to assign to every key. You cannot set individual values for each item in the dictionary. \n\tE.g. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict.fromkeys(fruits, \"In stock\")`\nIf we did not specify a value in our code, the default value for the keys in the dictionary would be `None`. \n- Dictionary comprehension: Creates a new dictionary from an existing list. You can specify different valuues for each key in the dictionary. \n\tE.g.\n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]` \n\t`fruit_dict = { fruit: \"In stock\" for fruit in fruits }\n\tThe dictionary comprehension runs through each item in the list `fruits`. We then add an item to our new dictionary for each fruit in our list. \n- `zip()` Converts (merges) two or more lists into a list of tuples. You can use the `dict()` method to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary. This way, one list can become the keys of the dictionary, and the other the values, e.g. if you have one list with fruits, and the other with the price of these fruits. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`prices = [3.5, 4.0, 2.1]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict(zip(fruits, prices))`\n\n#### Loop (iterate) over a dictionary\nDictionaries contain an `__iter__()` method that iterates over the keys. this method is automatically called when you put a dictionary into a `for` loop.\n`for key in a_dict: print (key)` \n\nIf you want access to the values, use the indexing operator `[]` with the dictionary and its keys:\n`for key in a_dict: print (a_dict[key])`  \n\nWhen you're working with dictionaries, it's likely that you'll want to work with both the keys and the values. One of the most useful ways to iterate through a dictionary is by using `.items()`, which is a method that returns a new view of the dictionaries items. It's a dynamic view, meaning that if the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. \nViews can be iterated over to yield their respective data, so you can iterate through a dictionary in Python by using the view object returned by `.items()`: \n`for item in a_dict.items(): print(item)`--\u003e returns tuples of the key-value pairs\n\n\nIf you just need to work with the keys of a dictionary, then you can use `.keys()`, which is a method that returns a new view object containing the dictionary's keys. To iterate through a dictionary by using `.keys()`, you just need to call `.keys()` in the header of a `for` loop:\n`for key in a_dict.keys(): print (key)` \nSimilarly, you can use `.values()` to iterate through values. \nBoth `.keys()` and `.values()` can be used to check if a key or value is present in a dictionary by using `in`: `\"apple\" in a_dict.values()`. \n\n#### Modifying values and keys\nYou'll need to use the original dictionary! \n\n#### Filtering items\nSometimes you'll want to create a new dictionary from an existing dictionary, that only stores the data that satisfies a given condition. You can do this with an `if` stateent inside a `for` loop:\n`a_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4}``\n`new_dict = {}`\n`for key, value in a_dict.items():`\n`if value \u003c= 2: new_dict[key] = value`\n`#new_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\", 2}` \n\n\n### Tuples\n`my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` --\u003e similar to list\n\nItems in a tuple are ordered (as in a list) and are accessed by indexing with square brackets.\n\nWhat's the difference from a list? A tuple's values can't be changed once it's created (i.e. **_immutable_**).\n\nWhen do you want to use a tuple? When creating something that shouldn't be changed or is protected from accidental change (e.g. the colour scheme of a website).\n\nWhen you want to change a tuple's values, you can convert it into a list by writing:  \n`list(my_tuple)`\nand then you can change the values as you would in a list.\n\n**Creating tuples:** \n`new_tuple = (first_item, second_item, third_item)`\n--\u003e separated by commas, and in round brackets\n\nTo access tuples, use same notation as for lists:\n`new_tuple[0] #first_item`\n\n\n## Functions\n**Functions**\nPython has built-in functions, e.g. `int()`, `range()`, `print()` or `round()`.\n\nCreating your own functions:\n`def my_function():`\n  `      content of function`\n\nTo call the function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**Functions with inputs**\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`    #Do this with something`\n`    #Then this `\n`    #And finally this with something`\n\nA function can have several parameters:\n`def my_function (param1, param2):`\n\nThis called **positional arguments**\n`def my_function (a, b, c):`\n`    #Do this with a`\n`    #then do this with b`\n`    #then this with c`\n\nIn comparison with keyword arguments the order doesn't matter. When a function is called, the name of the parameter is used, together with the argument for it:\n\n`my_function (a=1, b=2, c=3)`\n\nSince order doesn't matter, we could also write:\n\n`my_function (b=2, c=3, a=1)`\n\n**_Functions with outputs_**\n\nCan be simple or take inputs (arguments). Inside the function, the keyword `return` is used to \"transfer\" a result/output to the _outside_ of the function, so it can be used further.\n\n`def my_function():`\n`result = 2*3`\n`return result`\n\nAfter the `return` keyword, the function is exited, and anything that would come after the `return` keyword in the function will not be executed. This can be used to return the function early if needed (e.g. check with an `if` statement if some condition is true, and then just use the `return` keyword to exit out of the function).\n\n**Different types of functions:**\n  \n**_Simple functions_**\nVery simple, without any parameters. Just reduced complexity by reducing the amount of code you need to write (e.g. if there is a recurring task).\n\n`def my_function():`\n`#do this`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**_Functions with inputs_**\nFunctions with parameters take an input that gets passed into the function when the function is called. This allows us to modify what the function does, depending on what input was passed in.\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`#do this with something`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function(123)`\n\n\n**_Docstrings_**\nWith docstrings, you can include a comment or little explanation with your newly created function about what it does and what it takes as input. Docstrings must be placed in the first line of the function and have to be encased in triple quotation marks. They can run over several lines.\n\n`def some_function(a, b):`\n`\"\"\"This function takes inputs a and b and does something to them, `\n`returning something else.\"\"\"`\n\n**Keyword arguments**\nEspecially for functions you haven't written yourself, it's really useful to write keyword arguments instead of positional arguments when calling the function.\n\nWith keyword arguments, you specify which argument you are referring to.\n`def function1 (a, b, c):`\n`#some function text`\n`function1(a=13, b=44, c=0)`\n\n**Recursion** \n= calling a function inside itself\nYou can also take the output of one function call as an input for another function call. This is very useful for complex functions.\n\n**Useful functions:**\n\n`sum([list])` gives a sum of all items in the list\n`random.choice([list])` picks a random item from a list (requires to import the random package first)\n\nGlobal variables are by convention written in all caps.\n\nTo exit a function, simply use the `return` keyword.\n\n**Higher order function**\nA function that can work with other functions. E.g. it can take another function as an input and work with it inside the body of the function.\n\nWhen passing a function as an argument to another function, don't use the paranthesis at the end. E.g.\n`function_a (function_b)`\n\n\n## Debugging\n1. Describe the problem\n2. Reproduce the bug\n3. Play computer\n4. Fix the errors\n5. Print is your friend\n6. Use a debugger\n7. Take a break\n8. Ask a friend\n9. Run your code often\n10. Ask Stackoverflow\n\nTo access and change a global variable inside a local environment, e.g. a function, you have to write `global` + variable name first.\n\nFor example:\n`some_variable = 4`\n`def increase_something():`\n`global some_variable`\n`some_variable += 1``\n\n\n## Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n**OOP analogy:**\nYou come to a foreign country and don't know the language, don't know the city and don't have local money, but you want your clothes dry-cleaned. Instead of doing it yourself, you ask the hotel staff to do it, who know the language, the city and have local money.\n`hotel.dry_clean_clothes()`\n\n\nObjects have things they HAVE and things they DO.\nThings they HAVE = **_attributes_**\nE.g.\n`is_holding_plate = True`\n`tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]`\n\nThings they DO = **_methods_**\nMethods are functions specific for an object\nE.g.\n`def take_order(table, order):`\n`#takes order to chef`\n`def take_payment(amount):`\n`#add money to restaurant``\n\n### Classes\nClasses are _blueprints_ for objects.\nClasses are usually written in Pascal case, i.e. every word beginning is capitalized\nE.g.\n`car = CarBlueprint()`\n\nTo leave a class or function empty (for now), you can use the keyword `pass` to avoid \"indent error\" messages.\n\n#### init function\n**Constructor** = part of the class that specifies what should happen when our object is constructed (= initializing an object). Variables and counters are set to their starting values.\n\nUse special function `__init__ (self)` to initialize the attributes.\n\nThe init function is going to be called every time a new object from this class is created.\n\nIn addition to the parameter self, there can be as many parameters as you want in the brackets after __init__. These parameters get passed in when a new object is constructed. These parameters can then be used to set an object's attributes.\n\n\nTo have a default value for an attribute, instead of setting it equal to one of the parameters of the init function, set it to a value in the init function (not the parameters!).\n\ne.g.\n`def __init__ (self, user_id, username):`\n`self.user_id = user_id`\n`self.username = username`\n`self.followers = 0`\n\nThis way the new object has new_object.followers set to 0 by default.\n\nExample of init function:\n`class Car:`\n`def __init__(self, seats):`\n`self.seats = seats`\n\nThe number of seats specificied when a new object of this class is initialized gets passed to that object as an attribute.\n\n`new_car = Car(5)` --\u003e this will set the attribute new_car.seats to 5.\n\nThere can be many parameters in the init function. However, it means that whenever you create a new object from this class, you MUST provide all these pieces of information for the new object.\n\n#### Making a new class\n`class User:`\n`#add functions, etc.`\n\n`user_1 = User()` to make a new instance of the class\n\n`user_1.username = \"Silfa\"` to create a new attribute for the object. An attribute is a variable that is associated with an object.\n\nBut for attributes that all new instances should have in common, it's better to include them in the constructor.\n\n#### Methods in classes\nMethods = what the object DOES, i.e. a function that the object has.\n\nMethods can use `self.` attributes of objects.\n\nTo call the method, use the normal dot notation with brackets after the method, e.g.\n`user_1.start_game()`\n\nMethods in classes always need to have a `self` parameter as the first (and sometimes only) parameter. This means that when the method is called, it \"knows\" the object that called it.\n\n`def new_method(self):`\n`self.followers += 1`\n\nThe `self` keyword is a way to refer to the object that is being created from a class.\n\nWe can use the class name inside an object to tap into the class.\n\nFor example we can create a list of objects by initiating new instances of a class inside a loop and filling a list with these new objects. These objects have all the attributes that are defined in the class constructer, and these attributes can be accessed with dot notation.\n\n\nWhen inside a class, and calling one of the functions inside one of the other functions, you have to use `self.` before the function name.\n\nE.g.\n`def function_using_another_function(self, input, something):`\n`self.previous_function(attribute1, attribute2)`\n`...`\n\n\nDifferent **instances** of classes can have different **states**. E.g. Turty and Timmy can be different instances of the class Turtle(), and they can have different states, e.g. `turty.color = green` and `timmy.color = purple`. \n\n## Interesting modules and other things\n\n**colorgram** is a Python library that lets you extract colours from images.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Coding-log":{"title":"Coding log","content":"\n19-12-2020 \nRaycasting Coding challenge, p5.js, start https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo\u0026t=1374s\n\n20-12-2020\nCorals, branching network, Rune.js, https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/networks-and-space-colonization/\n\n29-12-2020\np5 \u003e rune sketch: P2.2.1\nMissing semester 2020: Command line environment\nGo through bash and shell commands\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Command-line-basics":{"title":"Command line bascis","content":"\nhttps://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/\n\nChange permissions to user execution:\n`chmod u+x filename`\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Genart-ideas":{"title":"Genart ideas","content":"\n## Starry night mountains\n\n![[Starry nights patch.jpg]]\nfrom https://www.etsy.com/se-en/listing/633985377/starry-night-mountain-patch-geometric?ref=shop_home_active_186\u0026crt=1\n\nRandomly placed points, connected to their nearest neightbours with dashed line, but only to their below neighbours. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Modules":{"title":"JS Modules","content":"\n## Modules\nA module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides for other modules to use, i.e. is visible to other modules (its _interface_). The interface are the connection points between different modules; there's some _internal_ stuff going on inside the module, and some _public_ stuff that is shared with other modules. \n\nSee also: [[JS Packages]], [[JS npm]]\n\nWhy modules:\n- To not have to code everything from scratch if you want to use something repeatedly. \n- To manage complexity.\n- To have a \"LEGO\" system of code pieces that can interact through well-defined connectors. \n\nThe relations between modules are called _dependencies_ (i.e. a module _depends_ on another module). Dependencies are the other modules that a module makes use of.\n\n_Think about how to structure your code and what should maybe go into modules after you have done most of the coding, not during. _\n\nIf we want to make dependency relations part of the code, we'll have to take control of **loading dependencies**. Doing that requires being able to execute strings as code. \nFor that, we use the `Function` constructor. It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names, and a string containing the function body. \n\n```\nlet plusOne = Function(\"n\", \"return n+1;\");\nconsole.log(plusOne(4));\n// 5\n```\n\n\n**`require`**\nWhen you call this function with the module name of a dependency, the module is loaded and returns its interface. Modules automatically get their own local scope. All they have to do is call `require` to access their dependencies and put their interface in the object boud to `exports`.\n\nUsually modules have their dependencies on the top, e.g.\n```\nconst ordinal = require(\"ordinal\");\n```\nCalling `require` involves reading the module's code, wrapping it in a function and calling it. \nIt's usually written as a filepath, e.g. `\"./format-date\"` (i.e. the file `format-date.js` in the same directory). \n\n**`exports`**\nThe module adds its interface function to `exports` so that modules that depend on it get access to it, e.g. \n```\nexports.formatDate = function(date, format) {......};\n``` \n\n**`module`**\n\n## ECMAscript modules\nSince 2015, there's a new standard, that's however slow to be widely adopted. It uses **`import`** instead of `require` to acess a dependency, and **`export`** instead of `exports` to export things. \n```\nimport ordinal from \"ordinal\";\n\nexport funciton formatDate(date, format) {......}\n```\n\nIt's possible to rename imported bindings using the word **`as`**:\n`import {days as dayNames} from \"date-names\"; `\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing your own modules, find out what data structures people are usually using and follow their example, if possible. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Packages":{"title":"JS Packages","content":"\n## Packages\n\n_Packages_ enable you to build a program out of separate pieces or run these pieces on their own, and also apply the same pieces in different programs. \nA _package_ is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed) on its own.

Create an .html file, specifying in the `\u003chead\u003e`: `\u003clink href=\"CSS/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\u003e`\n2. Create the `style.css` file and specify the style of various parts of the html document. \n3. To show both windows (html + css) next to each other in Visual Studio Code, right click on one of the files in the Explorer section and select Open to the side.\n\n__To run the website in your browser (from Visual Studio Code), click Terminal \u003e New terminal and then type live-server into the terminal. Then the webpage will show up in the browser and changes will be updated (when saved in VS).__\n\nTo refer to specific parts of the document, just type the part, followed by curly brackets, e.g. \n\t`body { font-size: 3rem;`\n\t\t\t\t`background: green; `\n\t\t\t\t`\n\nYou can refer to `img` (e.g. specifying borders around images), `h1` (to change the style of all H1 headers), `a` (to change the style of all links), etc. \n\nIf there are several segments with the same style, you can group them together, e.g. \n`h2, h3 {....}`\n\n\n### Classes\n\nTo further specify a style for certain selected parts of the website, create a class in the stylesheet:\n`.someclass { (some css style)}`\nand then in the .html file, add the following tag to the part of the code you want to apply that style on, e.g. a certain paragraph only. \n`\u003cp class=\"someclass\"\u003e ...... \u003c/p\u003e`\n\nClasses can be used several times in a document. You can use more than one class per html tag. \n\n\n### Pseudo-classes and links\nPseudo classes often start with a colon.\n\n`a:link` --\u003e unvisited links of a webpage\n`a:visited`--\u003e style for visited links\n`a:focus` --\u003e the currently \"focused\" (selected) element\n`a:hover` --\u003e state of link when hovered over\nThese pseudo classes (if used) must go in the order listed!  L - V - F - H\n\nIt's very nice, for example, to change the background colour of the link or make the text go bold when hovered over. \n\nTo use **classes** for specific links (e.g. a class \"bigandbold\", in the stylsheet write:\n`a.bigandbold { .... }` `\nand in the .html file write add the class tag to the relevant `\u003ca href.... \u003e`:\n`\u003ca href=\".....\" class=\"bigandbold\"\u003e....`\n\n_NB: Here, it's just a **.** whereas in the pseudo classes referring to all links in general, it was a **:**_\n\nClasses and pseudoclasses can also be grouped together (with other segments) if they should have the same style, e.g.:\n\n`h2, h3, .bigandbold, a:link { .... }` \nNB: separated by **comma**!\nSo the style is applied to all of these elements!\n\n### Targeting things more specifically\nChain the \"location\" together with spaces in between. = descendant selector.\nE.g. all unvisited links located inside an unordered list:\n`ul a:link { .....}`\nNB: separated by **space**!\nSo the styling is only applied to the a:link of the unsorted list.\n\n### IDs\nSimliar to classes, but can be used only once per page.\nIDs start with #:\n`#smallanditalics { .... }` \n\nIDs are very specific, overriding styles from elements and classes. \nIDs are not very common in CSS nowadays, but very common in Javascript.\n\n\n### Using a different font than what is by default offered in css\n\nFind a font on Google Font, e.g. Crimson Text.\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text\n\nClick on the little + sign next to the example text, e.g. for Regular.\nIn the \"Use on the web\" box, select \"@import\", then copy the text in between the `\u003cstyle\u003e... \u003c/style\u003e` tags.\n\nPaste this text at the very top of your css stylesheet.\n\nThen, when selecting a font-family, select \"Crimson Text\". \n\n\n### The Box model\n![](projects/attachments/Screenshot%202022-07-30%20at%2016.07.54.png)\n\n#### \u003c div\u003e\nMakes a box. (div = division)\n\nIt's often very useful to draw borders around elements (divs, paragraphs, headings, etc.) to figure out if the distance between them is caused by padding or by margins.\n\n`p { border: 2px black solid; }`\n\n#### margin\nMargin values can be negative or positive. Negative margins makes divs overlap.\n`margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left`\n\n#### border\nBorder around the div.\n`border-width, border-style, border-color, border-top, border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc.`\n\n#### Example of how to use divs\n`\u003cdiv class = \"box1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome text, blalbabllablab \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`\n\nAnd then in the css style sheet, the style of the .box1 class can be specified, e.g.:\n\n`.box1 {width: 25%;`\n\t\t\t`border: 2px solid black;`\n\t\t\t`background-color: green;`\n\t`}`\n\n\n#### block vs. inline elements\nBlock elements stretch across whole screen. \nInline elements are only as wide as their content (e.g. images, links, strong text, emphasised text).\n\nIn inline elements, you can only add *padding* to either side, not on top and bottom! \n\n##### How to change an inline element to a block element\nWhen I have a link (in-line element) and I want it to be bigger, e.g. filling out a whole box that is clickable.\n\n`a {display: block;}`\n\n\n#### Navigation bars\nUser `\u003cnav\u003e` html tag and fill it with an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e`) of links. To access only the links in that nav bar in the css style sheet (to e.g. specify a hover state), use :\n`nav a:hover {....}` \n\n##### Example of creating a navigational bar with clickable buttons\n\n1. In .html, make an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca....\u003e`) inside a `\u003cnav\u003e` tag with the links that you want in the navigation bar.\n2. In .css, change the font, e.g. `body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}`\n3. To access the list of navigation bar elements, type inside of `nav ul {...}`. \n4. To remove the points in front of unordered list items: `list-style-type: None`\n5. Good idea to clean up (i.e. remove) unnecessary margins and padding from some elements: `nav ul {padding: 0; margin: 0;}`\n6. Reduce the width of the box containing the links, i.e. the `\u003cli\u003e` element: `nav li {width: 8rem;}`\n7. Give the box a background colour to make it more visible: `nav li {background-color: lightblue;}`\n8. Center the link text inside the box: `nav li {text-align: center;}`\n9. Remove underlines of links: `nav a {text-decoration: none;}`\n10. More space between the buttons: `nav li {margin-bottom: 0.5rem;}`\n11. Change the hover state of the link: `nav a:hover {background-color: blue; color: lightblue;}`\n12. To make the link clickable area as big as the box that contains it, the link has to be changed from an inline element to a block element: `nav a {display: block;}`\n13. To make the vertical list of link buttons into a horizontal list: `nav li {display: inline-block;}`\n\n#### Floats\nUseful when text should flow around an image nicely.\n\nMake a class that you apply to the picture that defines that the image should be on the left and text should float around it:\n`.floatleft {float: left;}`\n\n### Shorthand for margins/padding\nInstead of specifying `margin-left`, `margin-top`, etc. use the **TRBL** shorthand:\n`margin: 2rem 1% 2px 0;`\nCan have mixed units.\n\n### Flexbox\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/hugo_basics":{"title":"Hugo basics","content":"\n## Front matter\nMarkdown files need front matter:\n`---\n`title: \"Some blog post\"`\n`date: 2022-07-30T09:01:05+01:00`\n`draft: false`  --\u003e if false, will not be published yet\n`---`\n\nOther things that can go into the front matter:\n**Cover image**\n`cover:`\n\t`image: img/somepic.jpg`\n\t`alt: \"This is alt text\"`\n\t`caption: \"This is the image caption\"`\n\n## Configuration file\nRead theme documentation to know exactly what can be changed in the config.yaml file.\n\nE.g. menu for \"Categories\" displayed (in PaperMod theme):\n\n`menu:\n\t`main:\n\t\t`identifier: categories`\n\t\t`name: Categories`\n\t\t`url: /categories/`\n\t\t`weight: 10`\n\n\nThen in the front matter of the \"Categories\" main .md page, add `layout: \"categories\"`  --\u003e this only works if there is a categories.html template in the chosen theme (e.g. under static\u003ethemes\u003ePaperMod\u003elayouts)\n`url: \"/categories/\"`\n`summary: categories`\nto the front matter below `title`.  \n\n\n## Theme overwrites\nNot recommended to directly update in the theme's files itself, otherwise the changes are lost when the theme is updated.\nBetter: make a local copy of the file that you want to change (e.g. archives.html). \nGo to your layouts folder and recreate the exact folder structure from your theme, leading to the archives.html file. \n\nThen whatever changes are done in _that_ file will overtake the settings in the original archives.html file. \n\n## Adding tags and categories to posts\n_Theme-specific!

Looks just pale yellow. Toor dal and Chana dal have increased in size quite a lot and have the consistency of raw potato.\n- Cook: Chana dal and Green mung dal: **5 min**; Toor dal: **10 min**. Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. `Could use less soaking or less cooking time.` Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.\n- Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix. Add 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) tempeh starter (_topcultures_). Spread in perforated plastic bags, incubate in cupboard above freezer. \n- Growth: Passive warming, not controlled. Start 09-09-2020, 12:00 (27°C).\n\t- Toor dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total inucubation time: **44h**.\n\t- Chana dal: Total incubation time (in cupboard): **44h**.\n\t- Green mung dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total incubation time: **48h**.\n\n### Chana dal\nSlower to colonise than the others, so left in cupboard for much longer. More and bigger holes made, because it was wet inside the plastic bag. `Needs to be dried off better!` Nice dense, fluffy mycelium, no spores. Slightly sour and damp smell.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133616.png]]\n\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133323.png]]\n\n### Toor dal\nGood colonisation, got warm quickly (32°C). At the end, a bit wet and slightly yeasty, alcoholic smell. More mycelium on the sides than in the middle, but nicely colonised through and through.

Yellow peas: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. Nice texture, grassy taste. Dehulling was a pain and there were weird peas that didn't get soft (~1%).\n\t2. Gotland lentils: **No soaking**. Cook for **12 min**. Nicely separated. Very good, fresh, chestnutty taste.\n\t3. Lentil Anicia: **No soaking**. Cook for **5 min**. Slightly tougher than Gotland linser, but also pleasant nutty taste.\n\t4. Fava beans: **Soak over night**, cook for **5 min**. Starchy, not a strong bean taste.\n\t5. Brown beans: **Soak over night**, dehull, boil for **18 min** `—\u003e much too long! Very mushy!` Starchy, clean taste. Dehulling was a pain, quite tough shell.\n\t6. White quinoa: **No soaking**. Rinse very thoroughly and cook for **9 min** in a lot of water. Fluffy and nice pop, slightly bitter, earthy taste, very voluminous.\n\t7. Toor dal: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. \n\n- Inoculation: Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and heat up in dry pan to remove moisture. Spread on clean tea towel and let dry a bit. Mix in a tub thoroughly with 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) starter (_topcultures_). \n- Growth: \n\t- Open: Prepare 7 portions in plastic or glass jars for open incubation in sous vide immersion water bath, set to **32°C** water temperature (=\"open\"). Incubation start, 19-09-2020, 21:00. Sous vide immersion cooker is very loud, but temperature in water bath was very even. Water bath shut off 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\t- Plastic: Prepare 7 bigger portions in perforated plastic bags for incubation above freezer (27°C at the start) (=\"plastic\"). In the cupboard the temperature was varied, but once the mycelium started to take over it got VERY warm in some samples (35-43°C!!). Bags put at room temperature 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\nResults:\n1. **Yellow peas**: Smell is quite mild, slightly mushroomy. Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans `—\u003e maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?` Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528094941.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095009.png]]\n\n2. **Gotland lentils**: Open: Very fluffy on the top and a tiny bit sporulation. Black colour is visible underneath, but that's from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling `—\u003e mix lentils with something else!` Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095038.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095058.png]]\n\n3. **Lentils Anicia**: Didn't develop mycelium at all, neither in bag nor in cup, and also not after \u003e 48h incubation. Discarded. `—\u003e Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?`\n\n4. **Fava beans**: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy `—\u003e dry the beans better next time and cook less!` Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets `—\u003e press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.` Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095210.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095234.png]]\n\n5. **Brown beans**: Plastic: Nice very white, dense block. Slight ammonia smell! Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095320.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095914.png]]\n\n6. **White quinoa**: Got the hottest and developed mycelium the fastest. The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It's sticky and slimy —\u003e remove! `—\u003e Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.` The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top `—\u003e incubate for a shorter time!` Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag `—\u003e Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095423.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095440.png]]\n\n7. **Toor dal**: Plastic. Very nice dense cake with thick, smooth, white mycelium all around. Open: Fluffy top with slight sporulation, otherwise similar density to plastic. Both: Smells of almost nothing, very mild. Nice mycelium throughout, no wet or non-grown spots. Perfect tempeh.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095558.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095616.png]]\n\n\n\n## Fava beans + additions (2020-09-30)\n_Test: Addition of things that give more texture to Fava bean tempeh: Sunflower seeds, sesame seeds._\n\nRecipe from [tempeh.info](http://tempeh.info): Soy+sunflower seeds: normal soy tempeh, but substitute 100-200 g of beans with sunflower seeds.

After about **40 h total**, incubation is done.\n\n\n## Shoyus and aminos\n### Soy-wheat shoyu\nFrom [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/):\n\nTraditional recipe: wheat berries/matvete (from soft wheat, not durum)= whole wheat kernel with bran, germ, endosperm but without the husk + soy beans.\nVariations: Use oats or barley instead of wheat, and lentils or chickpeas instead of soy beans.\n\n#### Ratio soy:wheat (legumes:grains): \n- Traditional **1 part dry soy, 1 part dry wheat** (by weight). \n- A bit more wheat: 1 part soaked soy, 1 part dry wheat. _The less wheat you use, the longer the sauce will have to ferment._\n\n#### Preparation:\n1. **Roast** the wheat berries in the oven until they are golden brown. Mill them in something like a coffee grinder on the coarsest setting or a food processor.\n2. **Soak** soy beans over night. (Soy beans will increase 2.3X when soaked, so calculate how much dry beans to use!)\n3. **Cook** soy beans for at least 40 min, until you can easily squeeze them between your fingers. Strain them and let steam a bit.\n4. **Mix** the steamy beans with the milled wheat (so the dry wheat soaks up the excess moisture). If it seems too wet, add more wheat. If it's too dry, spray some water onto it, or add more beans (if you have). Crush some of the soy beans with your hands.\n\n#### Inoculation:\n1. Dilute the spores, so they are easier to handle, with some flour.\n2. Check that **soybean/wheat mixture** has cooled down to below 40C. Spread spores over the mixture (e.g. with a tea strainer). Mix well.\n3. Line a pyrex dish with damp piece of cloth. Spread your mix into the dish. Cover with another moistened cloth. Put cling film over the dish, poke some holes in.\n4. Incubate (at **30C**) and keep a close eye on the temperature inside the koji, it can overheat very easily.\n5. After 24h, stir the mixture. Moisten the top cloth again if necessary. Put cling film back on and continue incubation. If koji overheats (\u003e37C) a lot, you have to stir a lot. Spread out in a thinner layer and turn off oven!\n6. After another 12h (**36h in total**) you should see a lot of growth. It shouldn't sporulate, but it's not the worst if it does a bit.\n\n#### Fermentation:\n1. Prepare a **15% brine**: 150 g of uniodised salt + 850 g of water. (You'll need about 1.65x the dry ingredients weight in brine weight).\n2. Clean your fermentation vessel well and pour in the koji.\n3. Pour the brine over the koji until the koji is covered. Let it soak for 1-2h. Pour some more brine until koji is covered again. Stir. You might have to add more brine over the next few days to keep the koji covered.\n4. Optional: Stir in a few tea spoons of unpasteurised miso to introduce beneficial bacteria.\n5. During the first **2-3 weeks, stir daily**. A lot of gas will be produced during that time that carry up solids to the surface. Push them down again so they don't get mouldy.\n6. Once your shoyu has settled down and is less active, reduce stirring to once every other day.\n\n#### Pressing:\nAfter **3-12 months**, put a cheese cloth into a sieve or colander, pour the fermentation mash in, cover with a cloth and put a weight on top. Let press over night. (Or use a cider press if you have one).\n\n#### Bottling:\n1. Clean bottles well, sterilise in oven (cover with aluminium foil, keep at 160C for at least 30 min, let cool down over night). Boil bottle caps in water.\n2. Heat the shoyu to 90C to kill off moulds and bacteria, but don't boil it! Pour the shoyu into the bottles and cap.\n\n\n### Bread aminos\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 680 g bread\n- 70 g all purpose or rice flour\n- 1 g (1 tsp) koji starter\n- 1.9 L water\n- 100 g for a 5% salt solution or 165 g for a 8% salt solution\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.\n2. Toast the flour in a pan over medium heat until slightly browned (5 min). Remove and let cool, then combine with koji spores.\n3. Mix koji-flour with bread cubes. Distribute very well.\n4. Transfer the inoculated bread to a casserole dish, cover with cling film and poke a few holes in.\n5. Set incubator to **30C** and place the pan in there. Check the internal temperature every few hours, it **should be 27-35C**.\n6. After 20-24h, you should notice a sweet smell. Stir the bread pieces, then continue to incubate for another 20-30h.\n7. When the koji is done, place everything into a glass jar. Boil the water with the salt and cool down to below 50C. Pour the brine onto the bread koji and mix thoroughly.\n8. Seal the jar with a lid and let sit at warm RT (27-29C) for 24h. Stir a few times during.\n9. Let mixture sit at regular RT for a week. Open the jar to release gases, stir at least once a day. After a week, the ferment should have settled down. When it's no longer active, seal the container and let it **age at RT for at least 6 months**.\n10. When you're ready to use the amino sauce, strain out the bread solids (or blend into a thicker sauce). Use the liquid for seasoning. Store in the fridge (because of low salt content).\n\n### Oat residue aminos\nAdapted from bread aminos (Shockey recipe) \nMade 2021-10-16 [Oat residue aminos](Oat residue aminos)\n\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 430 g dried oat residues (dried in oven at 50C for a day, from 1 kg fresh oat residue)\n- 44 g rice flour\n- 1 tsp **barley koji starter** (LUVI Ferments)\n- 1.2 L water\n- 63 g uniodised salt\n- 1 Tbsp seed miso\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Toast rice flour. Cool down to below 40C, then add about 1/5 of one bag of barley koji starter (whole bag is for 5 kg substrate).\n2. Disinfect a big bowl with Starsan and add the dried oat residues. _It feels rubbery, but not quite damp enough, so carefully add a little bit of water. Add 70 g of water and mix thoroughly with hands. Feels like a good dampness now._\n3. Mix in the flour koji starter with a tea strainer. Mix very thoroughly. _Oats feel quite dry again due to the flour, so add 100 g more water and mix._\n4. Pack into a Pyrex dish lined with a damp tea towel. Cover the oats with the tea towel, stick a thermometer in and cover with cling film + holes.\n5. Incubate at around **30C** until koji has grown nicely, but not sporulated (approx. **48h**).\n6. Place oat koji into a bowl, pour the (cooled down) brine onto it and mix throughly. Place in a large glass jar and leave at RT, stir occassionally for the next 2 weeks. _Mould forms on top over and over again, which looks exactly like koji mould —\u003e remove regularly and try to weigh down the solids to keep everything submerged (it’s hard, since the oat residue is very fine)._\n7. After about 2 weeks at RT in the open glass jar, divide between small plastic tubs with screw-top lids, fill completely to the brim and seal. Now leave at RT for up to 12 months.\n8. Strain away the solids and filter the liquid. Store in fridge until use. Use as flavouring agent when cooking.\n\n\n## Misos\n### Barley + fava miso\n1. Cook fava beans until they still have a bit of bite to them. \n2. Prepare barley koji (**48ish h**). Grind up equal amounts of fava and barely koji and mix with salt (10-ish%?). Put in jar, cover and leave for 6 months.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Miso-Tempeh-Natto-Shockey":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.217897126Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Oat-residue-aminos":{"title":"Oat residue aminos","content":"\n(photo)\n\nRecipe: [Koji recipes - Oat residue aminos](projects/fermentation/Koji%20recipes.md#Oat%20residue%20aminos)\n\n### 2021-10-16\n#### Incubation procedure:\n- 2021-10-16: 20:00 Internal start temp: 24 C.

Peel and cut onion into rough cubes. Peel garlic cloves. \n\nArrange vegetables in jar and fill up with brine until everything is covered. Top off with 1 vine leaf and weigh down so everything's submerged. Leave at room temperature for a 7-14 days. When it has a nice pickel-y taste and the liquid is cloudy, it's ready. Blend in blender to get sauce with the desired consistency. A bit of vinegar adds a nice flavour. If it's too thick, you can add a bit of water. Adjust salt to taste. Optional: mix with fruit purré or fermented fruit to get a fruitier and slightly sweet condiment.\n\nFill into clean bottles and keep in fridge for 2-12 months.\n\n\n## Kimchi (vegan)\nRecipe adapted from: https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-vegan-kimchi-recipe\n\n- 1 large Chinese cabbage\n- 1 small daikon radish\n- 8 spring onions\n- flaky sea salt (kosher salt)\n- 8 garlic cloves\n- 4 cm piece of ginger\n- 1/2 cup gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)\n- 2 Tbsp miso paste (white or red)\n- 1 Tbsp sugar\n\n_Made: 2022- [Kimchi](projects/fermentation/Kimchi.md)\n\n1. Wash cabbage, then remove trunk and cut the leaves into rough pieces (approx. 3x3 cm).\n2. Wash the daikon and cut into little sticks. \n3. Wash the spring onions, chop roughly and set aside. \n4. Place cabbage leaves, daikon and green parts of the spring onions into a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp flaky sea salt. Toss to combine and work in a bit with your hands. Cover with a plate or tea towel, then let sit at room temperature until cabbage is wilted (min. 1h, better up to 12h). The cabbage will release some liquid. \n5. Combine white parts of spring onion, minced garlic, finely chopped ginger, chili flakes, miso paste and sugar in a blender or food processor. Start pulsing to combine everything. Slowly add water to get to the right pasty consistency for it to blend properly (approx. 1 cup). Blend this past about 30 sec, scraping down the sides to not have too big chunks. \n6. Add the chili paste to the wilted cabbage and mix well with a spoon. \n7. Prepare glass jars by pouring boiling water into them and leaving to soak for a bit. Empty the jars and let cool down. \n8. Fill the cabbage-chili mixture into the jars, pressing down firmly with a spoon or chop stick to pack it tightly and not leave any air pockets. Make sure the top is covered with some of the liquid. \n9. Close jars and leave at room temperature for 24h. Then transfer to fridge and allow to ferment for at least 3 weeks before eating.  \n\nIt will not develop much CO2, so it's actually ok to close the jar tightly. I still air it from time to time during the first days and weeks, when I think about it. \n\nIt will last forever in the fridge and just get more sour and softer.

For dairy, both are firm, but for soy the 092 is still liquid after 8h. The acidity is quite low in all of them, although dairy 053 is quite pleasant. Soy 053 is very mild and vanilla-y. \n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\nContinue fermentation over night in the turned-off rice cooker: **10h, 40°C-RT** (=18h in total).\nAll yogurts are firm now, to differing degrees. Stir before tasting.\n- Dairy 053: Quite runny. Nice mellow acidity without sticking out too much. No off-flavours. **Duncan's favourite** (\"Tastes the most like yogurt.\").\n- Dairy 092: Also runny, but not as much as 053. In addition, there's a thick, slimy component to the texture that gives it nice body. Acidity is very mild (milder than 053), no off-flavours sticking out. **Silfa's favourite**. \n- Soy 053: Quite runny, similar to dairy 053, though a bit more watery (might be also due to the lower fat). Too sour, very strong single acidity that reminds of red currant and tingles on the tongue. Fruity notes, vanilla. \n- Soy 092: Quite runny, very similar to soy 053. Missing the body of dairy 092. Strong vanilla note and quite strong acidity. Some undefinable off-notes. Duncan thinks it's pretty bad tasting.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a few days in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 053: Soft and good body, a bit watery. Just plops off a spoon. Quite acidic and quite clean acidity. No off notes.\n- Dairy 092: Thick and gloopy, almost a bit stretchy. Drips off a spoon in a slightly viscous way. Very good almost buttery taste and fine acidity (not overwhelming). Still Silfa's favourite. \n- Soy 053: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Quite runny texture. Very sour and quite a one-note, clean acidity, bit fizzy on the tongue. Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Not much body (neither in texture nor in taste). A bit too sour for me to eat/enjoy. Duncan thinks it has similar sourness to fil, but needs more body/thickness.\n- Soy 092: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Quite runny texture, but also a tiny bit viscous. Sour, but also a mild/buttery note. Has more body in flavour than 092, better. Duncan likes this better, mostly because of the vanilla note.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Find higher fat soy milk? \n- Test same cultures with oat milk\n- Test different cultures and compare\n- Some time in between would probably be good, e.g. 10h at 40°C.\n\n### Vege011 and Öresunds fil starter cultures\n_2022-06-16_\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 01**, **Öresunds fil (Skånemejerier)**\n\nSubstrates: Fresh dairy milk (3% fat), Alpro soy milk (1.8% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milks to approx. 90°C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: \n- Freeze-dried culture: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (approx. 1/8 tsp) into 25 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 5 mL of that to inoculate each jar (of about 200 mL).\n- Store-bought fil: Take 1/2 Tbsp of fil and stir into each jar (of about 200 mL) = **1/4 Tbsp/100 mL**. \n\n**1st fermentation**: **8h, 40°C** (in the rice cooker)\n\nAfter 3h, the fil-inoculated soy and dairy milks already firmed up and started to get sour, while the Vege011 milks were still liquid and sweet. \n\nAfter 6h, the fil-inoculated firmed up even more, Vege011 were getting a little bit thicker.\n\nAfter 8h: fil-inoculated firmed up a lot in both soy and dairy. Vege011 have soft yogurt consistency.\n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\n- Dairy 011: Quite loose structure. Not very sour but nice taste.\n- Soy 011: Quite loose structure, looser than dairy 011. Not sour, quite sweet actually and very vanilla-y.\n- Dairy fil: Good stable gel-structure and very nice sourness. But not so nice to taste warm.\n- Soy fil: Firmness in between Dairy fil and Dairy 011. Not as sour as dairy fil but pleasant. Very vanilla-y.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a day in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 011: Smells very animaly/milky. Has firmed up a lot and holds shape on spoon. Mellow acidity, bit funky. Very pleasant. Slight cheesiness maybe. Great texture, almost like stirred yogurt from the start. Much denser than the soy yogurts. When stirred it becomes very homogenous and smooth, with a bit of a gloopy, viscous texture that slowly drips off a spoon. Duncan: texture is better, but taste is not much better than the soy gurts. \n- Soy 011: Smells like vanilla yogurt. Wobbly-gelly. Very loose, runny structure. Taste is very nice. Not really sour, but the sweetness of the soy milk has disappeared and it's quite neutral with a nice vanilla note. When stirred, it's very runny and looks almost like custard. Curdles a bit. Very refreshing taste. Duncan found it watery, but after adding a bit of salt it tasted much better.\n- Dairy fil: Smells a bit lemony. Great taste, very pleasant. Rich taste, mellow acidity, no off flavours. Texture is quite firm, stays on spoon. But when stirred it becomes nicely soft and smooth, even a bit thinner than dairy 011 and a bit less viscous. Duncan: could still have more acidity, but nice taste.\n- Soy fil: Smells less like vanilla and more a bit animaly/milky. A bit more sour than soy 011, but also not very strong. Very nice acidity level actually. Vanilla aroma is not overwhelming, but present. Texture is like a loose gel. When stirred, it gets almost gloopy. More homogeneous texture than soy 011, very smooth. Clean taste. Duncan thinks it should be more acidic.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Dairy 011 and dairy fil are quite similar in taste, texture and acidity level. Dairy 011 is a bit more mouth-filling and viscous, maybe some bacteria that make exopolysaccharides?\n- Soy011 is too loose and thin. Try fermenting longer? \n- Soy fil worked really well, but could also benefit from a bit longer fermentation.\n- The vanilla taste in the soy milk is a bit much, try to find another plant milk to test.\n- Salt improves taste of soy yogurts. \n\n## Oat\n_2022-05-06\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 053**, **Vege 092**\n\nSubstrates: Oatly chilled mellan (1.5% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milk to approx. 90°C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (fraction of 1/4 tsp) into 10 mL of water, shake.

Let's see how it develops after a few days in the fridge. Will need to be added quite sparingly to a dish, and not compete with too many other flavours. Maybe just with bread and sausage, for example? Fennel pieces are crunchy, but also got soft, bit chewy. Neither lemon nor mint seemed to have had much impact on taste (uness the bitterness comes from the lemon, in which case it had a negative impact).\n\nAfter 2 weeks in the fridge, the anise taste has mellowed out a bit and the acidity has increased nicely. **7 days was a good time to get it nicely sour, but still keep crunchiness**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Fennel.jpeg)","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.221897138Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/fermentation_main":{"title":"Fermentation projects","content":"\n### Vegetables fermentations\n\n[Vegetable recipes](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md)\n\n[Fermented vegetable production](projects/fermentation/Fermented%20vegetable%20production.md)\n\n\n### Dairy- and plant-based milk fermentations\n[[Yogurt recipes]]\n\n[[Yogurt production]]\n\n\n### Tempeh\n[[Tempeh recipes]]\n\n[Tempeh experiments](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20experiments.md)\n\n[Tempeh links](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20links.md)\n\n\n### Koji, shoyu, aminos\n\n[Koji recipes](projects/fermentation/Koji%20recipes.md)\n\n[Koji production](Koji%20production)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.221897138Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/fermented_carrot_parsley":{"title":"Fermented carrot and parsley root","content":"\n![[projects/attachments/Screenshot 2022-06-10 at 20.07.38.png]]\nRecipe: [Vegetable recipes - Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Vietnamese%20pickled%20carrot%20and%20daikon)\n\n_2022-03:_\n\nMade with **parsley root** instead of daikon. \nTastes really nice and no problems with fungi or yeasts during incubation.

Bitter note has faded a bit. **Harvest!**\n\n_Conclusion_: Both the carrot and the daikon are very crunchy, slightly sour, and still a bit bitter (unpleasant). Also, it smelled really bad (sulfurous) throughout the fermentation, sometimes worse sometimes less bad. Was considering leaving some out a bit longer to see how the fermentation progresses, but I'm a bit sick of the smell. Will probably ferment a bit further in the fridge anyway.  \n\nAfter 1-2 weeks in the fridge, the liquid has got clear (though it's still fizzing and bubbling a bit) and the bitterness has mellowed out. The acidity has increased slightly as well and is very pleasant now. Especially the carrots taste good, but the daikon is a bit too rotten/sulfuric tasting for my preference. **Maybe some sweet note missing to balance that out or cover it a bit?**\n\n_Try next time without the lemon (might have added bitterness?) and maybe a bit sugar in the brine afterwards when stored in the fridge._\n\n![](projects/attachments/Carrot%20daikon.jpeg)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.221897138Z","tags":null},"/quotes":{"title":"Good quotes","content":"\n\n\u003e It always seems impossible until it's done. - _Nelson Mandela_ \n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.221897138Z","tags":null},"/sewing/Attitude-trousers":{"title":"Attitude trousers","content":"\nhttps://www.atelier-scammit.com/women/89-attitude.html\n\n### Recommended fabrics\n-   Weight: light to medium-heavy (180 to 340 gsm or 4-8 oz.)\n-   Fabric: woven (denim, serge, velvet, flannel, wool...)\n-   Stretch factor*: 10-15 % with 1 to 2 % max elastane\n\n### Pictures\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163431.png)\n_Credit: @atelierscammit (https://www.instagram.com/p/CWGfZHaMI2p/)_\n\n![](projects/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163826.png)\n_Credit: Atelier Scammit (https://www.atelier-scammit.com/women/89-attitude.html)_\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.221897138Z","tags":null},"/sewing/Things-to-sew":{"title":"Things to sew","content":"\n\n- Blazer https://readytosew.fr/en/women-pdf/17-joe-blazer.html: in **dark copper cordoroy**. \n\tA slim-fit tailored jacket with some classic features.

Three little mountains with a view over the coast and to the Danish island Bornholm. Sandy beaches at the bottom (badplats!). Nice arboreum.\nFairly small and can easily be done in a day. Quite many people around (during summer season). Not really a \"wild\" national park, but still nice to walk through. \n\nWent there in August 2021: [Stenshuvuds nationalpark](trips/Stenshuvuds%20nationalpark.md) \n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nBus to Kivik (via Kristianstad) or bus via Lund and Simrishamn. Then the last few kilometers walking (6 km, e.g. along Skåneleden from Kivik to Simrishamn) or taxi.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamp ground at the northern entrance. Hotels and guesthouses in Kivik. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nSkåneleden goes through. \nVery easy to find hiking trails, well marked. The longest is not even 5 km long. \n\n\n## Dalby Söderkogs nationalpark\nSweden's smallest national park. Old southern Swedish leafy forest (oak, beech). Augustiner kloster from 1060s. \n\n#### Good to know\n- Prettiest in spring when vitsippor and gulsippor are covering the ground. \n- The naturrum is in Skrylle naturreservat.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nBus (50 min) from Lund Central.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nVinskydd in neighbouring Skrylle naturreservat. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nThree walking routes (0.5-3.5 km). One of them - Skryllestigen - then continues on through the naturreservat Dalby Norreskog and further to Skrylle naturreservat, which is actually much bigger than Dalby Söderskog. \n\n\n## Söderåsen nationalpark\nNorth-western Skåne, near Helsingborg. Goes from Åstorp to Röstånga. Lies exactly between European and Scandinavian continental plates, which formed a ravine and pushed up a small mountain (Kopparhatten, 200 m). \n\nBeech forests, high cliffs, ravines and a little river running through. Good views all around from the top of Kopparhatten. Quite small, but still Northern Europe's biggest protected leafy forest.\n\nWent there in June 2022: [Söderåsen nationalpark](trips/Söderåsen%20nationalpark.md)\n\n#### Good to know\n- Main entrance is in Skäralid, the Southern entrance in Röstånga. \n- Possible to go up Kopparhatten with the car.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Klippan, then bus to Skäralid or Röstånga (30 min). \n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamp grounds and vindskydd can be found at Dahlbergs and Liagården. Guesthouses in Röstånga. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nSkåneleden goes through the park (from Röstånga to Skäralid and then further on to Klåveröd). Several other trails between 2 and 7 km long starting from both Skäralid or Röstånga.\n\n\n## Åsnens nationalpark\nSweden's youngest national park (2018). Like a Sweden in miniature. Forests, lakes, islands. Nice in all seasons, but especially in winter when it's possible to walk on frozen lakes or in the autumn when Småland's mushroom Koralltaggsvampen grows. Many different kinds of trees including 250 year old beech trees.\n\nhttps://visitasnen.se/\n\n#### Good to know\n- Nice to go around by kayak or canoe. \n- Main entrance at Sunnabron, south of Växjö. Smaller entrance in Trollberget on the western side of the lake.\n- In some areas entrance is prohibited from 1 April to 31 July due to bird protection.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Växjö. Then a 44 min bus ride (or 4h30min walking) to Kråketorp gets you to the northern tip of the lake. From there it's 3h walk to the main entrance.\n\nTo enter from the southern side, bus from Växjö to Vipan or Torget Ryd are maybe good options. \n\n#### Stay overnight\nOne vindskydd with place for 3-4 tents near Utsikten. Nice-looking B\u0026B places around, e.g. Toftahult B\u0026B.\n\n#### Hiking routes\nSeveral small-ish ones around the three main entrances. Along the west side of the park leads the [cycle route Åsnen runt](https://www.naturkartan.se/sv/kronobergs-lan/asnen-runt)(140 km, along an old railway line with many nice views of the lake). There's also a 120 km long canoe route called [Värendsleden](https://www.naturkartan.se/en/kronobergs-lan/varendsleden?guide_id=64). \n\n\n## Store Mosse nationalpark\nIn the highlands of Småland. Raised bog (largest south of lapland) with 7m thick peat layer. Nature is barren. One of the best bird lakes in Sweden - Kävsjön. Not unusual to see elks (esp. at dusk or dawn), otters or one of the 19 bat species living here. \n\n#### Good to know\n- Bring water-proof shoes (maybe even wellies).\n- Around Kävsjön it can be quite many visitors, but usually the southern and eastern parts of the park are emptier. \n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain via Hässleholm and Alvesta to Värnamo (3.5 hours from Helsingborg). Another 15-20 min bus to get closer to the park, and to get to Hillerstorp.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nSeven camping sites in the park, and two old gårds - Lövö and Svanö (no electricity or water). \n\n#### Hiking routes\nRoutes of various length, altogether 50 km (about half of them with wooden planks). Cycle route [Hillerstorpareleden](https://vastrasmaland.se/sv/gnosjo/hillerstorpareleden/) goes right through the park from Hillerstorp to Värnamo. A 12 km long route leads around Kävsjön starting at the naturum. A 14 km long route goes from the naturum to the southern end of the park at Andersberg. On this one you can get vildmarkskänsla. \n\n\n## Blå Jungfruns nationalpark\n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Norra Kvills nationalpark\nVildmark in miniature. Big rocks and 350 year old trees, mostly pines. Not very big park. \n\n#### Good to know\n- A few km south of the park is the Kvills naturreservat that houses Kvilleken - Sweden's biggest and oldest tree (1000 years old). \n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\nTwo hiking routes, one 2.5 km long and one 4 km long. \n\n\n## Gotska Sandöns nationalpark\n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\n\n\n#### Stay overnight\n\n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Kosterhavets nationalpark\nFirst marine national park (2009). 400 islands and skerries. \n\n#### Good to know\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nFerries from Strömstad to Nordkoster (35 min) and Sydkoster (45 min). \n\n#### Stay overnight\nTwo hotels on Sydkoster, and many in places in Strömstad. Camping allowed on several spots around the park. \n\n#### Hiking routes\n\n\n## Tresticklans nationalpark\nNear Norwegian border. The biggest roadless and undeveloped (obebyggd) forest area in Southern Sweden. Untouched wilderness. Marshland, \n\n#### Good to know\n- 90 bigger and smaller lakes\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain from Gothenburg to Ed (1h17min). Then bus line 764 from Nössemark or Ed goes to Rävmarken a few times a day (weekdays), but has to be pre-ordered. Takes 26 min.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nAllowed to camp. On the Norwegian side there are a few huts in Bodalsviken. Not allowed to light fires (not even grill). \n\n#### Hiking routes\nFrom eastern entrance: Halleleden (4.5 km) that leads to riksgränsen (and further into Norway) - an old trading route. From the main entrance: Tresticklaleden (8 km). Possible to continue from there along Orhöjdsleden (10 km) and further through the Heråmadens naturreservat to Dals-Ed. \n\n\n## Djurö nationalpark\nIslands in Sweden's biggest lake Vänern.\n\n#### Good to know\n- Mostly only accessible with own boat.\n- The smaller islands are protected bird areas and can't be accessed 1 April - 31 July.\n- No possibility to buy food anywhere on the islands.\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nPossible to [order boat](https://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/park/djuro-nationalpark/besoksinformation/hitta-hit/) taxis from various places, e.g. Ekenäs. To get to Ekenäs, train to Säffle (1h37min from Gothenburg), then bus 808 (55 min). Or from Otterbäcken: train to Skövde (1h from Gothenburg), then bus 1 (51 min) to Otterbäcken via Mariestad.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nCamping allowed, but not in bird protection areas. \n\n#### Hiking routes\nOne marked route around the main island.\n\n\n## Tivedens nationalpark\nForests, huge rocks, lakes. Many different animals, e.g. wolves, elks, beavers, deer, hares, foxes.\n\n#### Good to know\n- Terrain is quite hilly, so wear good shoes. \n- Quite challenging hiking routes, so plan more time than you think (e.g. 4.5 km can easily take 3 hours).\n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nHard to reach without a car. Best is probably to go to Karlsborg: Train from Gothenburg to Skövde (1h), then bus 400 (55 min) to Karlsborg. Then taxi (20 min) or walk 4 hours to park entrance. \n\n#### Stay overnight\nAllowed to camp one night at various places. Hostel in Tivdedstorp.\n\n#### Hiking routes\nNine different marked routes. Cycle route LIlla Kungsleden goes through the park. One of the best is Stigmansrundan (4.3 km, 3h). Trehörningsrundan (9.5 km, 5h) goes around the lake and passes all three entrances to the park. \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T18:40:23.221897138Z","tags":null},"/trips/nationalparks_norrland":{"title":"National parks in Norrland","content":"\n## Abisko nationalpark - norra delen\n- Abisko nationalpark - södra delen\n- Björnlandets nationalpark\n\n## Färnebofjärdens nationalpark\nNear Dala river, wetland, old forests, unusually rich birdlife (\u003e200 species). Meeting point of Southern and Northern Swedish flora and fauna (leafy trees vs. Taiga conifers). Vildmarkskaraktär. Ofta överswämmat. Lövskogar. \n\n#### Good to know\n- **May** is the best month to visit. Nature awakes after winter and birds arrive, mosquitoes still rare. \n- Good to explore by foot, but best is via the water (canoe, kayak). \n- Several times votes as Sweden's best tourist destination.\n- It's allowed to pick berries and mushrooms (for own use).\n- A lot of mosquitoes during the summer.\n- Least visited part is near Tinäset in the Southern part. \n\n\n#### How to get there on public transport\nTrain to Stockholm, then Gävle. Bus 49 to **Gysinge** (=main entrance to national park), takes 1h.\n\n#### Stay overnight\nVarious vandrarhem, värdshus and B\u0026B in **Gysinge**.
