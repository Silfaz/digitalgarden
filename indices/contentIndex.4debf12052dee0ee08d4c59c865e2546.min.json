You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-23T06:36:04.71835096Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using a `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files.

Looks just pale yellow. Toor dal and Chana dal have increased in size quite a lot and have the consistency of raw potato.\n- Cook: Chana dal and Green mung dal: **5 min**; Toor dal: **10 min**. Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. `Could use less soaking or less cooking time.` Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.\n- Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix. Add 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) tempeh starter (_topcultures_). Spread in perforated plastic bags, incubate in cupboard above freezer. \n- Growth: Passive warming, not controlled.

Yellow peas: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. Nice texture, grassy taste. Dehulling was a pain and there were weird peas that didn't get soft (~1%).\n\t2. Gotland lentils: **No soaking**. Cook for **12 min**. Nicely separated. Very good, fresh, chestnutty taste.\n\t3. Lentil Anicia: **No soaking**. Cook for **5 min**. Slightly tougher than Gotland linser, but also pleasant nutty taste.\n\t4. Fava beans: **Soak over night**, cook for **5 min**. Starchy, not a strong bean taste.\n\t5. Brown beans: **Soak over night**, dehull, boil for **18 min** `—\u003e much too long! Very mushy!` Starchy, clean taste. Dehulling was a pain, quite tough shell.\n\t6. White quinoa: **No soaking**. Rinse very thoroughly and cook for **9 min** in a lot of water. Fluffy and nice pop, slightly bitter, earthy taste, very voluminous.\n\t7. Toor dal: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. \n\n- Inoculation: Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and heat up in dry pan to remove moisture. Spread on clean tea towel and let dry a bit. Mix in a tub thoroughly with 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) starter (_topcultures_). \n- Growth: \n\t- Open: Prepare 7 portions in plastic or glass jars for open incubation in sous vide immersion water bath, set to **32°C** water temperature (=\"open\"). Incubation start, 19-09-2020, 21:00. Sous vide immersion cooker is very loud, but temperature in water bath was very even. Water bath shut off 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\t- Plastic: Prepare 7 bigger portions in perforated plastic bags for incubation above freezer (27°C at the start) (=\"plastic\"). In the cupboard the temperature was varied, but once the mycelium started to take over it got VERY warm in some samples (35-43°C!!). Bags put at room temperature 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\nResults:\n1. **Yellow peas**: Smell is quite mild, slightly mushroomy. Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans `—\u003e maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?` Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528094941.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095009.png]]\n\n2. **Gotland lentils**: Open: Very fluffy on the top and a tiny bit sporulation. Black colour is visible underneath, but that's from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling `—\u003e mix lentils with something else!` Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095038.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095058.png]]\n\n3. **Lentils Anicia**: Didn't develop mycelium at all, neither in bag nor in cup, and also not after \u003e 48h incubation. Discarded. `—\u003e Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?`\n\n4. **Fava beans**: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy `—\u003e dry the beans better next time and cook less!` Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets `—\u003e press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.` Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095210.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095234.png]]\n\n5. **Brown beans**: Plastic: Nice very white, dense block. Slight ammonia smell! Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095320.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095914.png]]\n\n6. **White quinoa**: Got the hottest and developed mycelium the fastest. The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It's sticky and slimy —\u003e remove! `—\u003e Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.` The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top `—\u003e incubate for a shorter time!` Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag `—\u003e Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095423.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095440.png]]\n\n7. **Toor dal**: Plastic. Very nice dense cake with thick, smooth, white mycelium all around. Open: Fluffy top with slight sporulation, otherwise similar density to plastic. Both: Smells of almost nothing, very mild. Nice mycelium throughout, no wet or non-grown spots.

At lower temperatures: more proteases, at higher temperatures: more amylases.\n\nRelative humidity: 90% Spray with water if necessary\n\nSubstrate: rice, barley, soy, wheat etc. Substrate shouldn't be wet after cooking, but rather dry. Best is steaming (unless for shoyu, then cooking is better).\n\nAfter inoculation, stir for the first time after 24h, then every 4 hours or so.\n\nRice koji can be ready after 40 h, barley koji can take up to 50 h. Stop before (or when) spores develop (yellow-green spots). Cool the grains in the fridge or outside in a thin layer.\n\n\n## Different kojis\n### Barley koji\nFrom [https://thejapanstore.jp/blogs/column/how-to-make-barley-koji](https://thejapanstore.jp/blogs/column/how-to-make-barley-koji)\n\n_Barley miso made with barley koji has a lighter taste than rice miso made with rice koji._\n\n1. Wash barley → soak in water (1h) → drain water (30 min)→ steam barley wrapped in cloth (45 min)→ spread out and cool down to 40C. \n2. Sprinkle koji starter on cooked and cooled-down barley, mix well → wrap in cloth together as small as possible. \n3. Incubate (==30-35C==) for 18-20 hours, then separate the clumps that have formed. Keep for another 5-6 h, separate clumps again. Keep for another 20ish h (==total: 45ish h==)→ completion when it smells like chestnut.\n\n### Bread koji\nSee [[Koji recipes#Bread aminos]]\n\n## Shoyus and aminos\n### Soy-wheat shoyu\nFrom [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/):\n\nTraditional recipe: wheat berries/matvete (from soft wheat, not durum)= whole wheat kernel with bran, germ, endosperm but without the husk + soy beans.\nVariations: Use oats or barley instead of wheat, and lentils or chickpeas instead of soy beans.\n\n#### Ratio soy:wheat (legumes:grains): \n- Traditional ==1 part dry soy, 1 part dry wheat== (by weight). \n- A bit more wheat: 1 part soaked soy, 1 part dry wheat. _The less wheat you use, the longer the sauce will have to ferment._\n\n#### Preparation:\n1. **Roast** the wheat berries in the oven until they are golden brown. Mill them in something like a coffee grinder on the coarsest setting or a food processor.\n2. **Soak** soy beans over night. (Soy beans will increase 2.3X when soaked, so calculate how much dry beans to use!)\n3. **Cook** soy beans for at least 40 min, until you can easily squeeze them between your fingers. Strain them and let steam a bit.\n4. Mix the steamy beans with the milled wheat (so the dry wheat soaks up the excess moisture). If it seems too wet, add more wheat. If it's too dry, spray some water onto it, or add more beans (if you have). Crush some of the soy beans with your hands.\n\n#### Inoculation:\n1. Dilute the spores, so they are easier to handle, with some flour.\n2. Check that **soybean/wheat mixture** has cooled down to below 40C. Spread spores over the mixture (e.g. with a tea strainer). Mix well.\n3. Line a pyrex dish with damp piece of cloth. Spread your mix into the dish. Cover with another moistened cloth. Put cling film over the dish, poke some holes in.\n4. Incubate (at ==30C==) and keep a close eye on the temperature inside the koji, it can overheat very easily.\n5. After 24h, stir the mixture. Moisten the top cloth again if necessary. Put cling film back on and continue incubation. If koji overheats (\u003e37C) a lot, you have to stir a lot. Spread out in a thinner layer and turn off oven!\n6. After another 12h (==36h in total==) you should see a lot of growth. It shouldn't sporulate, but it's not the worst if it does a bit.\n\n#### Fermentation:\n1. Prepare a **15% brine**: 150 g of uniodised salt + 850 g of water. (You'll need about 1.65x the dry ingredients weight in brine weight).\n2. Clean your fermentation vessel well and pour in the koji.\n3. Pour the brine over the koji until the koji is covered. Let it soak for 1-2h. Pour some more brine until koji is covered again. Stir. You might have to add more brine over the next few days to keep the koji covered.\n4. Optional: Stir in a few tea spoons of unpasteurised miso to introduce beneficial bacteria.\n5. During the first ==2-3 weeks, stir daily==. A lot of gas will be produced during that time that carry up solids to the surface. Push them down again so they don't get mouldy.\n6. Once your shoyu has settled down and is less active, reduce stirring to once every other day.\n\n#### Pressing:\nAfter ==3-12 months==, put a cheese cloth into a sieve or colander, pour the fermentation mash in, cover with a cloth and put a weight on top. Let press over night. (Or use a cider press if you have one).\n\n#### Bottling:\n1. Clean bottles well, sterilise in oven (cover with aluminium foil, keep at 160C for at least 30 min, let cool down over night). Boil bottle caps in water.\n2. Heat the shoyu to 90C to kill off moulds and bacteria, but don't boil it! Pour the shoyu into the bottles and cap.\n\n\n### Bread aminos\nFrom _Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)_\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 680 g bread\n- 70 g all purpose or rice flour\n- 1 g (1 tsp) koji starter\n- 1.9 L water\n- 100 g for a 5% salt solution or 165 g for a 8% salt solution\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.\n2. Toast the flour in a pan over medium heat until slightly browned (5 min). Remove and let cool, then combine with koji spores.\n3. Mix koji-flour with bread cubes. Distribute very well.\n4. Transfer the inoculated bread to a casserole dish, cover with cling film and poke a few holes in.\n5. Set incubator to ==30C== and place the pan in there. Check the internal temperature every few hours, it ==should be 27-35C==.\n6. After 20-24h, you should notice a sweet smell. Stir the bread pieces, then continue to incubate for another 20-30h.\n7. When the koji is done, place everything into a glass jar. Boil the water with the salt and cool down to below 50C. Pour the brine onto the bread koji and mix thoroughly.\n8. Seal the jar with a lid and let sit at warm RT (27-29C) for 24h. Stir a few times during.\n9. Let mixture sit at regular RT for a week. Open the jar to release gases, stir at least once a day. After a week, the ferment should have settled down. When it's no longer active, seal the container and let it ==age at RT for at least 6 months==.\n10. When you're ready to use the amino sauce, strain out the bread solids (or blend into a thicker sauce). Use the liquid for seasoning. Store in the fridge (because of low salt content).\n\n### Oat residue aminos\nAdapted from bread aminos (Shockey recipe) \nMade 2021-10-16 [[Oat residue aminos]]\n\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 430 g dried oat residues (dried in oven at 50C for a day, from 1 kg fresh oat residue)\n- 44 g rice flour\n- 1 tsp **barley koji starter** (LUVI Ferments)\n- 1.2 L water\n- 63 g uniodised salt\n- 1 Tbsp seed miso\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Toast rice flour. Cool down to below 40C, then add about 1/5 of one bag of barley koji starter (whole bag is for 5 kg substrate).\n2. Disinfect a big bowl with Starsan and add the dried oat residues. _It feels rubbery, but not quite damp enough, so carefully add a little bit of water. Add 70 g of water and mix thoroughly with hands. Feels like a good dampness now._\n3. Mix in the flour koji starter with a tea strainer. Mix very thoroughly. _Oats feel quite dry again due to the flour, so add 100 g more water and mix._\n4. Pack into a Pyrex dish lined with a damp tea towel. Cover the oats with the tea towel, stick a thermometer in and cover with cling film + holes.\n5. Incubate at around ==30C== until koji has grown nicely, but not sporulated (approx. ==48h==).\n6. Place oat koji into a bowl, pour the (cooled down) brine onto it and mix throughly. Place in a large glass jar and leave at RT, stir occassionally for the next 2 weeks. _Mould forms on top over and over again, which looks exactly like koji mould —\u003e remove regularly and try to weigh down the solids to keep everything submerged (it’s hard, since the oat residue is very fine)._\n7. After about 2 weeks at RT in the open glass jar, divide between small plastic tubs with screw-top lids, fill completely to the brim and seal. Now leave at RT for up to 12 months.\n8. Strain away the solids and filter the liquid. Store in fridge until use. Use as flavouring agent when cooking.\n\n\n## Misos\n### Barley + fava miso\n1. Cook fava beans until they still have a bit of bite to them. \n2. Prepare barley koji (==48ish h===). Grind up equal amounts of fava and barely koji and mix with salt (10-ish%?). Put in jar, cover and leave for 6 months.\n\n\n\nRice koji\n\nFrom Miso, Natto, Tempeh\n\n525 g rice\n\n20 g rice flour\n\n1 g (1 tsp) koji starter\n\nCook (steam) rice to al dente consistency, then spread out into casserole for cooling.\n\nToast the flour in a pan for 5 min, cool down. Add koji spores to cooled flour.\n\nWhen rice is below 40C, mix koji in.\n\nCover dish with plastic wrap (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n\nIncubate at 30C. Check internal temperature every few hours, should be 27-35C.\n\nAfter 24h, sweet smell. Check temperature. Stir and break up lumps. Make furrows to dissipate heat.\n\nAfter around 40 h in total, rice koji is ready.\n\nOat koji\n\nFrom Miso, Natto, Tempeh\n\nLike rice koji, but use 3 cups of oat groats instead. Soak groats for 6-8h, then steam until al dente.\n\nNice oatmeal cookie smell when done.\n\nBarley koji\n\nFrom Miso, Natto, Tempeh\n\nMore prone to overheating! Nutty chestnut aroma when done. Will look less fuzzy than rice koji.\n\n1225 g pearled barley\n\n35 g wheat or rice flour\n\n2 g (2 tsp) koji starter\n\nSoak barley 6-8 h, drain and rinse. Steam for 1.5 hours or boil for 1h. Barley is done when the kernels are soft all the way through but not mushy. Drain and spread out on a drain to cool to below 40C.\n\nToast the flour for 5 min, cool down.\n\nAdd koji spores to cooled flour, mix well.\n\nSprinkle koji flour on barley, mix very well.\n\nPut everything into a deep dish, cover with cling film (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n\nIncubate at 30C, check internal temperature every few hours (should be 27-35C).\n\nAfter 24-36h, surface growth and sweet, mushroomy smell. Monitor heat closely, stir and break up lumps, make furrows to dissipate heat. Adjust moisture if needed.\n\nAfter about 40 h, incubation is done.","lastmodified":"2022-07-23T06:36:07.34650142Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Oat-residue-aminos":{"title":"","content":"# Oat residue aminos\n(photo)\n\nRecipe: [[Koji recipes#Oat residue aminos]]\n### 2021-10-16\n#### Incubation procedure:\n- 2021-10-16: 20:00 Internal start temp: 24 C.

It should taste slightly salty without being overwhelming. Add more salt if necessary, until it’s to your liking. The celeriac will become limp and liquid may begin to pool.\n\nTransfer a few handfuls at a time into a large jar, press down on each portion to remove air pockets. You should see some brine on top when you press. When the vessel is packed, leave a few centimers head space. Top with a weight and cover loosely.\n\nSet aside on a baking sheet to ferment, out of direct sunlight in a cool spot for 5-10 days. Check daily to make sure the celeriac is submerged, pressing down as needed to bring the brine back to the surface.\n\nStart tasting the kraut after 5 days. It’s ready when it’s pleasingly sour. The texture will be softer than cabbage-based kraut.\n\nWhen the kraut is ready, store it in jars, with lids tightened, in the fridge. It will keep like that for \u003e12 months.\n\n## Dill pickles\nMade 2022-04-20: [[Dill pickles]]\n\n## Fermented lotus root\nAdapted recipe for [[Vegetable recipes#Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon]]\n_Made 2022-06-26: **Did not work!

For dairy, both are firm, but for soy the 092 is still liquid after 8h. The acidity is quite low in all of them, although dairy 053 is quite pleasant. Soy 053 is very mild and vanilla-y. \n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\nContinue fermentation over night in the turned-off rice cooker: ==10h, 40°C-RT== (=18h in total).\nAll yogurts are firm now, to differing degrees. Stir before tasting.\n- Dairy 053: Quite runny. Nice mellow acidity without sticking out too much. No off-flavours. ==Duncan's favourite== (\"Tastes the most like yogurt.\").\n- Dairy 092: Also runny, but not as much as 053. In addition, there's a thick, slimy component to the texture that gives it nice body. Acidity is very mild (milder than 053), no off-flavours sticking out. ==Silfa's favourite==. \n- Soy 053: Quite runny, similar to dairy 053, though a bit more watery (might be also due to the lower fat). Too sour, very strong single acidity that reminds of red currant and tingles on the tongue. Fruity notes, vanilla. \n- Soy 092: Quite runny, very similar to soy 053. Missing the body of dairy 092. Strong vanilla note and quite strong acidity. Some undefinable off-notes. Duncan thinks it's pretty bad tasting.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a few days in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 053: Soft and good body, a bit watery. Just plops off a spoon. Quite acidic and quite clean acidity. No off notes.\n- Dairy 092: Thick and gloopy, almost a bit stretchy. Drips off a spoon in a slightly viscous way. Very good almost buttery taste and fine acidity (not overwhelming). Still Silfa's favourite. \n- Soy 053: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Quite runny texture. Very sour and quite a one-note, clean acidity, bit fizzy on the tongue. Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Not much body (neither in texture nor in taste). A bit too sour for me to eat/enjoy. Duncan thinks it has similar sourness to fil, but needs more body/thickness.\n- Soy 092: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Quite runny texture, but also a tiny bit viscous. Sour, but also a mild/buttery note. Has more body in flavour than 092, better. Duncan likes this better, mostly because of the vanilla note.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Find higher fat soy milk? \n- Test same cultures with oat milk\n- Test different cultures and compare\n- Some time in between would probably be good, e.g. 10h at 40°C.\n\n### Vege011 and Öresunds fil starter cultures\n_2022-06-16_\nStarter cultures: ==Vege 011==, ==Öresunds fil (Skånemejerier)==\nSubstrates: Fresh dairy milk (3% fat), Alpro soy milk (1.8% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milks to approx. 90°C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n**Starter culture**: \n- Freeze-dried culture: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (approx. 1/8 tsp) into 25 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 5 mL of that to inoculate each jar (of about 200 mL).\n- Store-bought fil: Take 1/2 Tbsp of fil and stir into each jar (of about 200 mL) = **1/4 Tbsp/100 mL**. \n\n**1st fermentation**: ==8h, 40°C== (in the rice cooker)\nAfter 3h, the fil-inoculated soy and dairy milks already firmed up and started to get sour, while the Vege011 milks were still liquid and sweet. \nAfter 6h, the fil-inoculated firmed up even more, Vege011 were getting a little bit thicker.\nAfter 8h: fil-inoculated firmed up a lot in both soy and dairy. Vege011 have soft yogurt consistency.\n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\n- Dairy 011: Quite loose structure. Not very sour but nice taste.\n- Soy 011: Quite loose structure, looser than dairy 011. Not sour, quite sweet actually and very vanilla-y.\n- Dairy fil: Good stable gel-structure and very nice sourness. But not so nice to taste warm.\n- Soy fil: Firmness in between Dairy fil and Dairy 011. Not as sour as dairy fil but pleasant. Very vanilla-y.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a day in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 011: Smells very animaly/milky. Has firmed up a lot and holds shape on spoon. Mellow acidity, bit funky. Very pleasant. Slight cheesiness maybe. Great texture, almost like stirred yogurt from the start. Much denser than the soy yogurts. When stirred it becomes very homogenous and smooth, with a bit of a gloopy, viscous texture that slowly drips off a spoon. Duncan: texture is better, but taste is not much better than the soy gurts. \n- Soy 011: Smells like vanilla yogurt. Wobbly-gelly. Very loose, runny structure. Taste is very nice. Not really sour, but the sweetness of the soy milk has disappeared and it's quite neutral with a nice vanilla note. When stirred, it's very runny and looks almost like custard. Curdles a bit. Very refreshing taste. Duncan found it watery, but after adding a bit of salt it tasted much better.\n- Dairy fil: Smells a bit lemony. Great taste, very pleasant. Rich taste, mellow acidity, no off flavours. Texture is quite firm, stays on spoon. But when stirred it becomes nicely soft and smooth, even a bit thinner than dairy 011 and a bit less viscous. Duncan: could still have more acidity, but nice taste.\n- Soy fil: Smells less like vanilla and more a bit animaly/milky. A bit more sour than soy 011, but also not very strong. Very nice acidity level actually. Vanilla aroma is not overwhelming, but present. Texture is like a loose gel. When stirred, it gets almost gloopy. More homogeneous texture than soy 011, very smooth. Clean taste. Duncan thinks it should be more acidic.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Dairy 011 and dairy fil are quite similar in taste, texture and acidity level. Dairy 011 is a bit more mouth-filling and viscous, maybe some bacteria that make exopolysaccharides?\n- Soy011 is too loose and thin. Try fermenting longer? \n- Soy fil worked really well, but could also benefit from a bit longer fermentation.\n- The vanilla taste in the soy milk is a bit much, try to find another plant milk to test.\n- Salt improves taste of soy yogurts. \n\n## Oat\n_2022-05-06\nStarter cultures: ==Vege 053==, ==Vege 092==\nSubstrates: Oatly chilled mellan (1.5% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milk to approx. 90°C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n**Starter culture**: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (fraction of 1/4 tsp) into 10 mL of water, shake.
