They ought to support a big push. But this is simply a thing that is not going to happen in the time frame we need it to happen.`\n\nTakeaway message:\n- Doomerism doesnt' work\n- Anticapitalism doesn't work\n- Degrowth rhetoric doesn't work\n\nWe can't wait for _the_ big governmental push either. \nBUT things are already moving. Many \"small\" actions (state-wide, individual, etc.). \n`Everyone pushes wherever they can push.`\n\n-----\n\nI agree that doomerism and degrowth rhetoric are counterproductive to getting more people excited to care about the climate. And I agree that going hard anticapitalism probably would result in more emissions than persuing solutions forming under existing capitalism.\n\nBut climate change is not the only bad effect of overabundance and consumerism. \n\n\u003eDon't speak the language of sacrifice, speak the language of abundance (renewable energy is getting cheaper, so we can use more of it, electric cars are coming so no need to stop driving, etc.). \n\nExploitation, pollution, destruction of ecostystem is still continuing if everyone wants their own electric car and wants to fly around the world every two months and buy all the gadgets and tools they'll never use etc. Encouraging people to not rethink their wasteful ways of living, just \"make it a bit greener\", robs us of the chance to rethink priorities, how cities are built, how society works, how wealth is or should be distributed and if we really need everything that ads and companies tell us we need.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:56.724333134Z","tags":null},"/climate/Personal-action":{"title":"Personal action and reducing your own carbon footprint","content":"\nAnother article that argues that personal action doesn't have much impact and that people shouldn't be too preachy about it: https://medianism.org/2022/08/15/you-cant-get-no-satisfaction-from-reducing-your-own-personal-carbon-footprint/\n\nI totally agree with the premise: \n\u003eBeing self-righteous about your own personal actions against climate change can make other people feel inferior and cause them to reject the entire idea. \n\n\u003eOur most important job as environmentalists is to convince the people who haven't yet been convinced that we should do anything at all.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that working on reducing your own personal footprint is pointless. Sure, it's much more important to work on collective reduction in carbon emissions than to fret about a piece of cheese you ate or a pair of trousers you bought, but who if not WE AS CONSUMERS should stop consuming? Fewer things being needlessly produced, fewer things being shipped around the planet, fewer things ending up in landfills and oceans. \nIt's always presented as such a sacrifice, but I think many people (in rich countries) could live an equally happy, if not happier, life if their focus wasn't so much on accumulating things and spending money on status symbols. \n\nAnyway, I also agree that:\n\u003e There is an asymmetry between the efforts of climate-change environmentalists versus big carbon. Environmentalists spend a lot of our moral resources to increase our personal moral purity and reduce our individual carbon footprint. On the other side of the political divide, big carbon doesn‚Äôt waste any resources on personal moral purity and so they can devote all their resources to influence the public spere to stop policies that would actually make a difference.\n\nBut big carbon makes a LOT of money and has interest in making even more. On the other hand environmentalists are not driven by profit and can't offer the same incentives to (corrupt) politicians as oil lobbyists do.\n\nOverall, I agree that if you want to have maximum impact, it's much better to **look for actions with the most impact**, participate in organisations and events, be vocal about climate change and be inclusive and not alienating about it, than to _just_ reduce your own personal carbon footprint. \nBut again, how is anything supposed to change if no one is making ANY change? Many drops make an ocean. We need both - personal action and collective action. One doesn't work without the other, it's a chicken and egg problem. \n\n**Actions:**\n- Find impactful and public climate actions (including: donate to and support the actions that have the most impact). \n- Be vocal about participating in (fun) climate actions.\n- Show the upsides of leading a low-carbon life style. It's not a sacrifice: not owning a car is freedom; train travel is fun, cheap and fast; repairing clothes is often more rewarding than buying  new ones; vegan food is delicious and healthy; hobbies don't have to cost money or be based on consumption.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:56.724333134Z","tags":null},"/climate/climate_main":{"title":"Environment \u0026 climate action","content":"\n## Reading\n[[climate/How we will fight climate change]]\n [[climate/Personal action]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:56.724333134Z","tags":null},"/content/projects":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:56.724333134Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\nÂá†‰πéÂú®Êàë‰ª¨ÊÑèËØÜÂà∞‰πãÂâçÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Â∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ªÂºÄ‰∫ÜÂú∞Èù¢„ÄÇ\n\nÏö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Í∑∏Í≤ÉÏùÑ ÏïåÍ∏∞ÎèÑ Ï†ÑÏóê Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî ÎïÖÏùÑ Îñ†ÎÇ¨ÏäµÎãàÎã§.\n\nÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„Åå„Åù„Çå„ÇíÁü•„Çã„Åª„ÅºÂâç„Å´„ÄÅÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„ÅØÂú∞Èù¢„ÇíÈõ¢„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:56.728333187Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

Just put in a variable name instead of the `print` statement:\n\n1.  name = input (\"What's your name?\")\n\nSimilarly, if I want to turn the answer immediately into a different data type, I can do that together with the `input` command:\n\n`age =¬†int(input (\"How old are you?\")`\n\nUsually, inputs are strings, so if I just write:\n\n`name =¬†input(\"What's your name?\")`\n\nThe input value is stored as a string.\n\n### Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings\n`type()` Check the type of a variable, e.g. int, str\n`str()` Turn something into a string\n`int()` Turn something in to an integer\n`round()` Round a number to a specific number of decimal places, e.g. `round(3.5542, 2)`\n\n**F-string:** In front of a string (i.e. in front of the quotes) you type an `f`, then you can include different data types in curly brackets in the quotes. No need to doing `str()` or `int()`, etc.\n\n`print (f\"My weight is {weight} kg and my height is {height} m.\")`\n\n`variable =¬†variable + 1` is the same as `variable += 1`\n\nSame for -=, *=, /=\n\nE.g. `variable =¬†variable*2` is the same as `variable *=2`\n\n### Control flow and logical operators\n`if condition 1:`\n`    do A`\n`elif condition 2:`\n`    do B`\n`else: `\n`    do C`\n\n`\"Silvia\".lower()` --\u003e¬†\"silvia\"\n`\"Silvia\".count(\"i\")`¬†--\u003e¬†2\n\nUse three single quotes for writing multi-line strings:\n\n`print ('''This`\n`is a `\n`multi-`\n`line string`\n`''')``\n\n### Random module\nRandom number generation with the random module:\n\n`random.randint(1, 10) #Generates random integer between (and including)¬†1 and 10`\n`random.random() #Generates random float between (and including)¬†0 and (excluding) 1`\n\nPick a random item from a list:\n`random.choice(list_name)`\n\n_Don't try to learn every single function by heart. Instead, when you come across a new thing (e.g. a new data structure), read through the documentation to see what is possible. Then next time when you use it, you can look specific things up._\n\n**When importing modules:** \n\neither\n`import chosen_module`\n`print (chosen_module.sentence)`\n\nor\n`from chosen_module import sentence`\n`print (sentence)`\n\nor\n`import chosen_module as mod`\n`print (mod.sentence)`\n\nE.g. to import and use the Turtle class from the turtle module, either write:\n`import turtle`\n`new_turtle = turtle.Turtle()`\n\nor\n`from turtle import Turtle`\n`new_turtle = Turtle()`\n\nThe latter is useful when the class is used often and you don't want to type `turtle.Turtle()`¬†all the time.\n\nIt's also possible to import everything from a module and use it as if it was part of the normal environment (i.e. without the module name).\n`from turtle import *`\n\nThis however can be confusing, since it's often good to know which module a function belongs to.\n\nE.g.\n`choice([1,3,4])` looks confusing out of context. But if you write `random.choice([1,3,4])` it's much clearer that it is part of the random module and that a random number is picked from this list.\n\nFor long module names, it's also possible to use aliases:\n\n`import turtle as t`\n`new_turtle = t.Turtle()`\n\n### Lists\n**Lists** store data in a specific order\n`fruits =¬†[\"Cherry\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"]`\n\nTo access a specific entry from the list:\n`fruits[0]` or `fruits[-1]`\n\nTo add an item to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append(\"Melon\")`\n\nTo add several times to the end of an existing list:\n`fruits.append([\"Strawberry\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"]`\n\n`random.choice(list)`\nThis generates a random choice from a given list.\n\n`str.split()`\nSplits a string into separate components based on some defined divider, e.g. a comma.\n\n`str.split(\",\")`\nThe result will be a **list** that contains the separate components of the string.\n\nNested lists contain **lists of lists**. When addressing a specific item in a nested list, you have to first pick the right nested list, then the item in that list, e.g. the first item in the first list would be:\n`print (list([0][0])`\n\nTransform a string into a list:\n`list(string)`\n\n**in**\n\nThe **in** construct is an easy way to test if an element is contained in a collection, e.g. in a list.\n\n`list = [\"Silfa\", \"Duncan\", \"Laika\"]`\n`if \"Silfa\" in list:`\n`    print (\"yay\")`\n\n### Loops\n`letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`   print (letter)``\n\nNB:¬†The item (here `number`)¬†in a for loop does **NOT** count from 0 to i, but instead takes the value of the first item in the list (e.g. `\"a\"`)¬†and takes on that value. This means, that to have some kind of **counting variable** that is first set to 0 (outside the loop)¬†and then increases with each round inside the loop, you have to do the following:\n`count = 0`\n`for letter in letters:`\n`    print (letter)`\n`    count += 1``\nThen with each round through the loop, `count` will increase by 1, and will in the end have the same value as items in `letters`.\n\nFor loops are often used to loop through lists, but you can also loop through ranges of items that are not lists.\n\n**for loops and the** `**range()**` **function**\n\n`for number in range (a, b):`\n`    print (number)`\n_NB:¬†a is included, b is not_\n\nThe step size can also be changed, e.g. to increase the numbers by 3, type:\n`range(1, 100, 3)`\n\n**So there are 2 types of for loops:**\ntype 1\n\n`for item in list _of_items:`\n`    #do something to each item`\n\ntype 2\n`for number in range(a,b):`\n`    #do something``\n\n**_When to use a for and when a while loop?_**\n\n**For** loops are great when you iterate over something, and you want to do something with each thing you iterate over. E.g. iterating through a list.\n\n  \n\n**While** loops are used when you just want to carry out some sort of functionality many times until a condition is met. Don't care about what number in a sequence you're in, which item in a list you're iterating through, etc.\n\nWhile loops are a bit more dangerous than for loops. In for loops you always have an upper bound, but while loops will continue running until the condition evaluates to `FALSE`. That can lead to infinite loops.\n\nA good thing to do when you don't know why you get an infinite loop, simply `print()` the condition inside the loop and check what's happening.\n\n**While loop**\nA loop that keeps on going while a condition is `TRUE`.\n\n`while something_is_true:`\n`    #do a thing, then test the condition again, etc.`\n\nOnce the condition evaluates to FALSE, the while loop is skipped.\n\nExample of how a while loop can be used:\n`count =¬†6`\n`while count \u003e 0:`\n¬† ¬† ¬† `print (\"Hello!\")`\n¬† ¬† ¬† `count -= 1¬† ¬†#this decreases the` `number of counts by one every time` `the loop runs`\n  \nWhile loops can also be used while a condition is `FALSE`. For that, use this syntax:\n\n`while not some_condition_that_is_true:`\n`    #do something`\n\nThis means the loop runs while the condition is `FALSE`, but as soon as it evaluates to `TRUE`, we drop out of the loop.\n\nA good way to **include a check in a while loop** is to set a variable to `True` (or `False`) before the while loop starts. Then set the while loop to run WHILE¬†the `variable == True`. Inside the while loop, something makes the variable either remain `True` or switch to `False`. In case of False, the while loop will stop.\n\nA good way to **increase something or build something up in a For loop** is to set an empty string or an empty list outside of the for loop first. Then inside the for loop, in every turn something is added to the string or list, adding up to the final string or list when the for loop is finished.\n\n### Dictionaries\nDictionaries are useful if you want to associate labels with each value. Lists are better if you are storing similar data, such as a list of proces or names, where you cannot label each value.\n\n`dictionary1 = {`\n`   key1: value1,`\n`   key2: value2,`\n`   key3: value3,`\n`   }\n\nTo get a value back:\n`dictionary1[key2]`\n\nTo add an entry to the dictionary:\n`dictionary1[key4] =¬†value4`\n\nSimilar to lists and strings, it's often useful to start with an _empty_ dictionary, and then later on add to the dictionary.\n`dic_new =¬†{}`\n\nWhen looping through a dictionary, usually the **key** will be picked out:\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`   print (key)`\n\nIf you want to access a specific **value** in a dictionary (e.g. when looping through the dictionary):\n\n`for key in dictionary1:`\n`    print (dictionary1[key])``\n\n**Nested dictionaries**\nThe nested dictionaries don't need to be the same size as the outer dictionaries. They can also include lists, strings, numbers, etc.\n\nLists are ordered and are accessed by the position inside the list. Dictionaries are NOT ordered.\n\nDictionaries (or lists)¬†are like folders. They can contain values, but they can also contain other dictionaries (or lists).\n\nA **_dictionary that contains a list_** looks like this:\n\n`travel_log = {`\n`   \"France\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"],`\n`    \"Germany\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n`    }`\n\n  \nA **_dictionary that contains a dictionary_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = {`\n      `\"France\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], \"total_visits\": 12},`\n      `\"Germany\": {\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"], \"total_visits\": 5},`\n`}`\n\nAnd a **_list that contains dictionaries_** looks like this:\n`travel_log = [`\n`{`\n`\"country\": \"France\", `\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Paris\", \"Lille\", \"Dijon\"], `\n`\"total_visits\": 12,`\n` },`\n` {`\n`\"country\": \"Germany\",`\n`\"cities_visited\": [\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Stuttgart\"],`\n` \"total_visits\": 5,`\n` },`\n` ]`\n\nTo get **values** from a dictionary, type the variable for the dictionary, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[\"name\"]`\n\nTo get the **keys** from a dictionary, you can turn the keys into a list, and then refer to an item in this list. NB: items in a list are ordered, while items in a dictionary are not!\n`keys_list =¬†list(dictionary)`\n\nTo get **values from a dictionary of lists**, type the variable for the dictionary, the index of the entry in question, followed by the key in square brackets:\n`dictionary[0][\"name\"]`\n\n#### Generate dictionary from a list\nSeveral options:\n- `dict.fromkeys()` Used to create a dictionary from a list. It accepts a list of **keys** that you want to turn into a dictionary. Optionally, you can specify a value you want to assign to every key. You cannot set individual values for each item in the dictionary. \n\tE.g. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict.fromkeys(fruits, \"In stock\")`\nIf we did not specify a value in our code, the default value for the keys in the dictionary would be `None`. \n- Dictionary comprehension: Creates a new dictionary from an existing list. You can specify different valuues for each key in the dictionary. \n\tE.g.\n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]` \n\t`fruit_dict = { fruit: \"In stock\" for fruit in fruits }\n\tThe dictionary comprehension runs through each item in the list `fruits`. We then add an item to our new dictionary for each fruit in our list. \n- `zip()` Converts (merges) two or more lists into a list of tuples. You can use the `dict()` method to convert the list of tuples into a dictionary. This way, one list can become the keys of the dictionary, and the other the values, e.g. if you have one list with fruits, and the other with the price of these fruits. \n\t`fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]`\n\t`prices = [3.5, 4.0, 2.1]`\n\t`fruit_dict = dict(zip(fruits, prices))`\n\n#### Loop (iterate) over a dictionary\nDictionaries contain an `__iter__()` method that iterates over the keys. this method is automatically called when you put a dictionary into a `for` loop.\n`for key in a_dict: print (key)` \n\nIf you want access to the values, use the indexing operator `[]` with the dictionary and its keys:\n`for key in a_dict: print (a_dict[key])`  \n\nWhen you're working with dictionaries, it's likely that you'll want to work with both the keys and the values. One of the most useful ways to iterate through a dictionary is by using `.items()`, which is a method that returns a new view of the dictionaries items. It's a dynamic view, meaning that if the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. \nViews can be iterated over to yield their respective data, so you can iterate through a dictionary in Python by using the view object returned by `.items()`: \n`for item in a_dict.items(): print(item)`--\u003e returns tuples of the key-value pairs\n\n\nIf you just need to work with the keys of a dictionary, then you can use `.keys()`, which is a method that returns a new view object containing the dictionary's keys. To iterate through a dictionary by using `.keys()`, you just need to call `.keys()` in the header of a `for` loop:\n`for key in a_dict.keys(): print (key)` \nSimilarly, you can use `.values()` to iterate through values. \nBoth `.keys()` and `.values()` can be used to check if a key or value is present in a dictionary by using `in`: `\"apple\" in a_dict.values()`. \n\n#### Modifying values and keys\nYou'll need to use the original dictionary! \n\n#### Filtering items\nSometimes you'll want to create a new dictionary from an existing dictionary, that only stores the data that satisfies a given condition. You can do this with an `if` stateent inside a `for` loop:\n`a_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4}``\n`new_dict = {}`\n`for key, value in a_dict.items():`\n`if value \u003c= 2: new_dict[key] = value`\n`#new_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\", 2}` \n\n\n### Tuples\n`my_tuple =¬†(1, 2, 3)` --\u003e similar to list\n\nItems in a tuple are ordered (as in a list) and are accessed by indexing with square brackets.\n\nWhat's the difference from a list?¬†A tuple's values can't be changed once it's created (i.e. **_immutable_**).\n\nWhen do you want to use a tuple?¬†When creating something that shouldn't be changed or is protected from accidental change (e.g. the colour scheme of a website).\n\nWhen you want to change a tuple's values, you can convert it into a list by writing:  \n`list(my_tuple)`\nand then you can change the values as you would in a list.\n\n**Creating tuples:**¬†\n`new_tuple =¬†(first_item, second_item, third_item)`\n--\u003e separated by commas, and in round brackets\n\nTo access tuples, use same notation as for lists:\n`new_tuple[0] #first_item`\n\n\n## Functions\n**Functions**\nPython has built-in functions, e.g. `int()`, `range()`, `print()` or `round()`.\n\nCreating your own functions:\n`def my_function():`\n¬† `¬† ¬† ¬† content of function`\n\nTo call the function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**Functions with inputs**\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`    #Do this with something`\n`    #Then this `\n`    #And finally this with something`\n\nA function can have several parameters:\n`def my_function (param1, param2):`\n\nThis called **positional arguments**\n`def my_function (a, b, c):`\n`    #Do this with a`\n`    #then do this with b`\n`    #then this with c`\n\nIn comparison with keyword arguments the order doesn't matter. When a function is called, the name of the parameter is used, together with the argument for it:\n\n`my_function (a=1, b=2, c=3)`\n\nSince order doesn't matter, we could also write:\n\n`my_function (b=2, c=3, a=1)`\n\n**_Functions with outputs_**\n\nCan be simple or take inputs (arguments). Inside the function, the keyword `return` is used to \"transfer\"¬†a result/output to the _outside_ of the function, so it can be used further.\n\n`def my_function():`\n`result = 2*3`\n`return result`\n\nAfter the `return` keyword, the function is exited, and anything that would come after the `return` keyword in the function will not be executed. This can be used to return the function early if needed (e.g. check with an `if` statement if some condition is true, and then just use the `return` keyword to exit out of the function).\n\n**Different types of functions:**\n  \n**_Simple functions_**\nVery simple, without any parameters. Just reduced complexity by reducing the amount of code you need to write (e.g. if there is a recurring task).\n\n`def my_function():`\n`#do this`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function()`\n\n**_Functions with inputs_**\nFunctions with parameters take an input that gets passed into the function when the function is called. This allows us to modify what the function does, depending on what input was passed in.\n\n`def my_function(something):`\n`#do this with something`\n`#then do this`\n`#finally do this`\n\nTo call this function:\n`my_function(123)`\n\n\n**_Docstrings_**\nWith docstrings, you can include a comment or little explanation with your newly created function about what it does and what it takes as input. Docstrings must be placed in the first line of the function and have to be encased in triple quotation marks. They can run over several lines.\n\n`def some_function(a, b):`\n`\"\"\"This function takes inputs a and b and does something to them, `\n`returning something else.\"\"\"`\n\n**Keyword arguments**\nEspecially for functions you haven't written yourself, it's really useful to write keyword arguments instead of positional arguments when calling the function.\n\nWith keyword arguments, you specify which argument you are referring to.\n`def function1 (a, b, c):`\n`#some function text`\n`function1(a=13, b=44, c=0)`\n\n**Recursion** \n=¬†calling a function inside itself\nYou can also take the output of one function call as an input for another function call. This is very useful for complex functions.\n\n**Useful functions:**\n\n`sum([list])` gives a sum of all items in the list\n`random.choice([list])` picks a random item from a list (requires to import the random package first)\n\nGlobal variables are by convention written in all caps.\n\nTo exit a function, simply use the `return` keyword.\n\n**Higher order function**\nA function that can work with other functions. E.g. it can take another function as an input and work with it inside the body of the function.\n\nWhen passing a function as an argument to another function, don't use the paranthesis at the end. E.g.\n`function_a (function_b)`\n\n\n## Debugging\n1. Describe the problem\n2. Reproduce the bug\n3. Play computer\n4. Fix the errors\n5. Print is your friend\n6. Use a debugger\n7. Take a break\n8. Ask a friend\n9. Run your code often\n10. Ask Stackoverflow\n\nTo access and change a global variable inside a local environment, e.g. a function, you have to write `global` + variable name first.\n\nFor example:\n`some_variable = 4`\n`def increase_something():`\n`global some_variable`\n`some_variable += 1``\n\n\n## Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n**OOP analogy:**\nYou come to a foreign country and don't know the language, don't know the city and don't have local money, but you want your clothes dry-cleaned. Instead of doing it yourself, you ask the hotel staff to do it, who know the language, the city and have local money.\n`hotel.dry_clean_clothes()`\n\n\nObjects have things they HAVE¬†and things they DO.\nThings they HAVE =¬†**_attributes_**\nE.g.\n`is_holding_plate = True`\n`tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]`\n\nThings they DO =¬†**_methods_**\nMethods are functions specific for an object\nE.g.\n`def take_order(table, order):`\n`#takes order to chef`\n`def take_payment(amount):`\n`#add money to restaurant``\n\n### Classes\nClasses are _blueprints_ for objects.\nClasses are usually written in Pascal case, i.e. every word beginning is capitalized\nE.g.\n`car =¬†CarBlueprint()`\n\nTo leave a class or function empty (for now), you can use the keyword `pass` to avoid \"indent error\" messages.\n\n#### init function\n**Constructor** =¬†part of the class that specifies what should happen when our object is constructed (= initializing an object). Variables and counters are set to their starting values.\n\nUse special function `__init__ (self)` to initialize the attributes.\n\nThe init function is going to be called every time a new object from this class is created.\n\nIn addition to the parameter self, there can be as many parameters as you want in the brackets after __init__. These parameters get passed in when a new object is constructed. These parameters can then be used to set an object's attributes.\n\n\nTo have a default value for an attribute, instead of setting it equal to one of the parameters of the init function, set it to a value in the init function (not the parameters!).\n\ne.g.\n`def __init__ (self, user_id, username):`\n`self.user_id = user_id`\n`self.username = username`\n`self.followers = 0`\n\nThis way the new object has new_object.followers set to 0 by default.\n\nExample of init function:\n`class Car:`\n`def __init__(self, seats):`\n`self.seats = seats`\n\nThe number of seats specificied when a new object of this class is initialized gets passed to that object as an attribute.\n\n`new_car =¬†Car(5)` --\u003e this will set the attribute new_car.seats to 5.\n\nThere can be many parameters in the init function. However, it means that whenever you create a new object from this class, you MUST¬†provide all these pieces of information for the new object.\n\n#### Making a new class\n`class User:`\n`#add functions, etc.`\n\n`user_1 =¬†User()`¬†to make a new instance of the class\n\n`user_1.username =¬†\"Silfa\"` to create a new attribute for the object. An attribute is a variable that is associated with an object.\n\nBut for attributes that all new instances should have in common, it's better to include them in the constructor.\n\n#### Methods in classes\nMethods = what the object DOES, i.e. a function that the object has.\n\nMethods can use `self.` attributes of objects.\n\nTo call the method, use the normal dot notation with brackets after the method, e.g.\n`user_1.start_game()`\n\nMethods in classes always need to have a `self` parameter as the first (and sometimes only)¬†parameter. This means that when the method is called, it \"knows\" the object that called it.\n\n`def new_method(self):`\n`self.followers += 1`\n\nThe `self` keyword is a way to refer to the object that is being created from a class.\n\nWe can use the class name inside an object to tap into the class.\n\nFor example we can create a list of objects by initiating new instances of a class inside a loop and filling a list with these new objects. These objects have all the attributes that are defined in the class constructer, and these attributes can be accessed with dot notation.\n\n\nWhen inside a class, and calling one of the functions inside one of the other functions, you have to use `self.` before the function name.\n\nE.g.\n`def function_using_another_function(self, input, something):`\n`self.previous_function(attribute1, attribute2)`\n`...`\n\n\nDifferent **instances** of classes can have different **states**. E.g. Turty and Timmy can be different instances of the class Turtle(), and they can have different states, e.g. `turty.color = green` and `timmy.color = purple`. \n\n## Interesting modules and other things\n\n**colorgram** is a Python library that lets you extract colours from images.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Coding-log":{"title":"Coding log","content":"\n19-12-2020 \nRaycasting Coding challenge, p5.js, start https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo\u0026t=1374s\n\n20-12-2020\nCorals, branching network, Rune.js, https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/networks-and-space-colonization/\n\n29-12-2020\np5 \u003e rune sketch: P2.2.1\nMissing semester 2020: Command line environment\nGo through bash and shell commands\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Command-line-basics":{"title":"Command line bascis","content":"\nhttps://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/\n\nChange permissions to user execution:\n`chmod u+x filename`\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/Genart-ideas":{"title":"Genart ideas","content":"\n## Starry night mountains\n\n![[Starry nights patch.jpg]]\nfrom https://www.etsy.com/se-en/listing/633985377/starry-night-mountain-patch-geometric?ref=shop_home_active_186\u0026crt=1\n\nRandomly placed points, connected to their nearest neightbours with dashed line, but only to their below neighbours. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Modules":{"title":"JS Modules","content":"\n## Modules\nA module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides for other modules to use, i.e. is visible to other modules (its _interface_). The interface are the connection points between different modules; there's some _internal_ stuff going on inside the module, and some _public_ stuff that is shared with other modules. \n\nSee also: [[JS Packages]], [[JS npm]]\n\nWhy modules:\n- To not have to code everything from scratch if you want to use something repeatedly. \n- To manage complexity.\n- To have a \"LEGO\" system of code pieces that can interact through well-defined connectors. \n\nThe relations between modules are called _dependencies_ (i.e. a module _depends_ on another module). Dependencies are the other modules that a module makes use of.\n\n_Think about how to structure your code and what should maybe go into modules after you have done most of the coding, not during. _\n\nIf we want to make dependency relations part of the code, we'll have to take control of **loading dependencies**. Doing that requires being able to execute strings as code. \nFor that, we use the `Function` constructor. It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names, and a string containing the function body. \n\n```\nlet plusOne = Function(\"n\", \"return n+1;\");\nconsole.log(plusOne(4));\n// 5\n```\n\n\n**`require`**\nWhen you call this function with the module name of a dependency, the module is loaded and returns its interface. Modules automatically get their own local scope. All they have to do is call `require` to access their dependencies and put their interface in the object boud to `exports`.\n\nUsually modules have their dependencies on the top, e.g.\n```\nconst ordinal = require(\"ordinal\");\n```\nCalling `require` involves reading the module's code, wrapping it in a function and calling it. \nIt's usually written as a filepath, e.g. `\"./format-date\"` (i.e. the file `format-date.js` in the same directory). \n\n**`exports`**\nThe module adds its interface function to `exports` so that modules that depend on it get access to it, e.g. \n```\nexports.formatDate = function(date, format) {......};\n``` \n\n**`module`**\n\n## ECMAscript modules\nSince 2015, there's a new standard, that's however slow to be widely adopted. It uses **`import`** instead of `require` to acess a dependency, and **`export`** instead of `exports` to export things. \n```\nimport ordinal from \"ordinal\";\n\nexport funciton formatDate(date, format) {......}\n```\n\nIt's possible to rename imported bindings using the word **`as`**:\n`import {days as dayNames} from \"date-names\"; `\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing your own modules, find out what data structures people are usually using and follow their example, if possible. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/JS-Packages":{"title":"JS Packages","content":"\n## Packages\n\n_Packages_ enable you to build a program out of separate pieces or run these pieces on their own, and also apply the same pieces in different programs. \nA _package_ is a chunk of code that can be distributed (copied and installed) on its own.

Create an .html file, specifying in the `\u003chead\u003e`: `\u003clink href=\"CSS/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\u003e`\n2. Create the `style.css` file and specify the style of various parts of the html document. \n3. To show both windows (html + css) next to each other in Visual Studio Code, right click on one of the files in the Explorer section and select Open to the side.\n\n__To run the website in your browser (from Visual Studio Code), click Terminal \u003e New terminal and then type live-server into the terminal. Then the webpage will show up in the browser and changes will be updated (when saved in VS).__\n\nTo refer to specific parts of the document, just type the part, followed by curly brackets, e.g. \n\t`body { font-size: 3rem;`\n\t\t\t\t`background: green; `\n\t\t\t\t`\n\nYou can refer to `img` (e.g. specifying borders around images), `h1` (to change the style of all H1 headers), `a` (to change the style of all links), etc. \n\nIf there are several segments with the same style, you can group them together, e.g. \n`h2, h3 {....}`\n\n\n### Classes\n\nTo further specify a style for certain selected parts of the website, create a class in the stylesheet:\n`.someclass { (some css style)}`\nand then in the .html file, add the following tag to the part of the code you want to apply that style on, e.g. a certain paragraph only. \n`\u003cp class=\"someclass\"\u003e ...... \u003c/p\u003e`\n\nClasses can be used several times in a document. You can use more than one class per html tag. \n\n\n### Pseudo-classes and links\nPseudo classes often start with a colon.\n\n`a:link` --\u003e unvisited links of a webpage\n`a:visited`--\u003e style for visited links\n`a:focus` --\u003e the currently \"focused\" (selected) element\n`a:hover` --\u003e state of link when hovered over\nThese pseudo classes (if used) must go in the order listed!  L - V - F - H\n\nIt's very nice, for example, to change the background colour of the link or make the text go bold when hovered over. \n\nTo use **classes** for specific links (e.g. a class \"bigandbold\", in the stylsheet write:\n`a.bigandbold { .... }` `\nand in the .html file write add the class tag to the relevant `\u003ca href.... \u003e`:\n`\u003ca href=\".....\" class=\"bigandbold\"\u003e....`\n\n_NB: Here, it's just a **.** whereas in the pseudo classes referring to all links in general, it was a **:**_\n\nClasses and pseudoclasses can also be grouped together (with other segments) if they should have the same style, e.g.:\n\n`h2, h3, .bigandbold, a:link { .... }` \nNB: separated by **comma**!\nSo the style is applied to all of these elements!\n\n### Targeting things more specifically\nChain the \"location\" together with spaces in between. = descendant selector.\nE.g. all unvisited links located inside an unordered list:\n`ul a:link { .....}`\nNB: separated by **space**!\nSo the styling is only applied to the a:link of the unsorted list.\n\n### IDs\nSimliar to classes, but can be used only once per page.\nIDs start with #:\n`#smallanditalics { .... }` \n\nIDs are very specific, overriding styles from elements and classes. \nIDs are not very common in CSS nowadays, but very common in Javascript.\n\n\n### Using a different font than what is by default offered in css\n\nFind a font on Google Font, e.g. Crimson Text.\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text\n\nClick on the little + sign next to the example text, e.g. for Regular.\nIn the \"Use on the web\" box, select \"@import\", then copy the text in between the `\u003cstyle\u003e... \u003c/style\u003e` tags.\n\nPaste this text at the very top of your css stylesheet.\n\nThen, when selecting a font-family, select \"Crimson Text\". \n\n\n### The Box model\n![](projects/attachments/Screenshot%202022-07-30%20at%2016.07.54.png)\n\n#### \u003c div\u003e\nMakes a box. (div = division)\n\nIt's often very useful to draw borders around elements (divs, paragraphs, headings, etc.) to figure out if the distance between them is caused by padding or by margins.\n\n`p { border: 2px black solid; }`\n\n#### margin\nMargin values can be negative or positive. Negative margins makes divs overlap.\n`margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left`\n\n#### border\nBorder around the div.\n`border-width, border-style, border-color, border-top, border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc.`\n\n#### Example of how to use divs\n`\u003cdiv class = \"box1\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome text, blalbabllablab \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`\n\nAnd then in the css style sheet, the style of the .box1 class can be specified, e.g.:\n\n`.box1 {width: 25%;`\n\t\t\t`border: 2px solid black;`\n\t\t\t`background-color: green;`\n\t`}`\n\n\n#### block vs. inline elements\nBlock elements stretch across whole screen. \nInline elements are only as wide as their content (e.g. images, links, strong text, emphasised text).\n\nIn inline elements, you can only add *padding* to either side, not on top and bottom! \n\n##### How to change an inline element to a block element\nWhen I have a link (in-line element) and I want it to be bigger, e.g. filling out a whole box that is clickable.\n\n`a {display: block;}`\n\n\n#### Navigation bars\nUser `\u003cnav\u003e` html tag and fill it with an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e`) of links. To access only the links in that nav bar in the css style sheet (to e.g. specify a hover state), use :\n`nav a:hover {....}` \n\n##### Example of creating a navigational bar with clickable buttons\n\n1. In .html, make an unordered list (`\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca....\u003e`) inside a `\u003cnav\u003e` tag with the links that you want in the navigation bar.\n2. In .css, change the font, e.g. `body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}`\n3. To access the list of navigation bar elements, type inside of `nav ul {...}`. \n4. To remove the points in front of unordered list items: `list-style-type: None`\n5. Good idea to clean up (i.e. remove) unnecessary margins and padding from some elements: `nav ul {padding: 0; margin: 0;}`\n6. Reduce the width of the box containing the links, i.e. the `\u003cli\u003e` element: `nav li {width: 8rem;}`\n7. Give the box a background colour to make it more visible: `nav li {background-color: lightblue;}`\n8. Center the link text inside the box: `nav li {text-align: center;}`\n9. Remove underlines of links: `nav a {text-decoration: none;}`\n10. More space between the buttons: `nav li {margin-bottom: 0.5rem;}`\n11. Change the hover state of the link: `nav a:hover {background-color: blue; color: lightblue;}`\n12. To make the link clickable area as big as the box that contains it, the link has to be changed from an inline element to a block element: `nav a {display: block;}`\n13. To make the vertical list of link buttons into a horizontal list: `nav li {display: inline-block;}`\n\n#### Floats\nUseful when text should flow around an image nicely.\n\nMake a class that you apply to the picture that defines that the image should be on the left and text should float around it:\n`.floatleft {float: left;}`\n\n### Shorthand for margins/padding\nInstead of specifying `margin-left`, `margin-top`, etc. use the **TRBL** shorthand:\n`margin: 2rem 1% 2px 0;`\nCan have mixed units.\n\n### Flexbox\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/coding/hugo_basics":{"title":"Hugo basics","content":"\n## Front matter\nMarkdown files need front matter:\n`---\n`title: \"Some blog post\"`\n`date: 2022-07-30T09:01:05+01:00`\n`draft: false`  --\u003e if false, will not be published yet\n`---`\n\nOther things that can go into the front matter:\n**Cover image**\n`cover:`\n\t`image: img/somepic.jpg`\n\t`alt: \"This is alt text\"`\n\t`caption: \"This is the image caption\"`\n\n## Configuration file\nRead theme documentation to know exactly what can be changed in the config.yaml file.\n\nE.g. menu for \"Categories\" displayed (in PaperMod theme):\n\n`menu:\n\t`main:\n\t\t`identifier: categories`\n\t\t`name: Categories`\n\t\t`url: /categories/`\n\t\t`weight: 10`\n\n\nThen in the front matter of the \"Categories\" main .md page, add `layout: \"categories\"`  --\u003e this only works if there is a categories.html template in the chosen theme (e.g. under static\u003ethemes\u003ePaperMod\u003elayouts)\n`url: \"/categories/\"`\n`summary: categories`\nto the front matter below `title`.  \n\n\n## Theme overwrites\nNot recommended to directly update in the theme's files itself, otherwise the changes are lost when the theme is updated.\nBetter: make a local copy of the file that you want to change (e.g. archives.html). \nGo to your layouts folder and recreate the exact folder structure from your theme, leading to the archives.html file. \n\nThen whatever changes are done in _that_ file will overtake the settings in the original archives.html file. \n\n## Adding tags and categories to posts\n_Theme-specific!

Kind of beef-like, because it's a bit too chewy. `‚Äî\u003e Definitely needs to be mixed with other beans to give it a better texture. Also, reducing the cooking time might give it a bit more defined texture.`\n\n6. Control: **Toor dal**: Very chewy, surprisingly homogenous. Kind of pork-vibe.\n\nWorst-to-best ranking:\n\n**Brown b√∂nor - Gotland lentils - quinoa - yellow peas - toor dal - fava beans.** `‚Äî\u003e Definitely work on the fava beans more, try combinations with quinoa and linser to give it a bit more bite and a nicer look. Also try additions like seaweed, chili, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame), etc.`\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/Different-legumes":{"title":"Different legumes","content":"\n## Different Indian dals (2020-09-09)\n*Test: Chana dal, Toor dal, Green mung dal*\n\nStandard recipe (according to [Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey)](Miso, Tempeh, Natto (Shockey)), adapted. \n- Material: Chana dal, Toor dal, Green mung dal from Indian shop, Herkulesgatan, Gothenburg. 125 g dry dal.\n- Soak: Wash and soak in water for 10h, then change water and soak for another 12 h (not necessary, but I didn't have time to cook it earlier). **Total soaking 22h.** Green mung dal had lost all its husks and was very easy to dehull. Looks just pale yellow. Toor dal and Chana dal have increased in size quite a lot and have the consistency of raw potato.\n- Cook: Chana dal and Green mung dal: **5 min**; Toor dal: **10 min**. Chana dal has a nice bite and a bit of starchyness, but good flavour. Toor dal has a nice bite, but starchy and a bit watery. `Could use less soaking or less cooking time.` Green mung dal is nicely al dente and holds together well, has lost the green shells.\n- Inoculation: 0.5 Tbsp apple cider vinegar added (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and return to warm pot to steam off, Then let cool down on tray and add another 0.5 tsp vinegar, mix. Add 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) tempeh starter (_topcultures_). Spread in perforated plastic bags, incubate in cupboard above freezer. \n- Growth: Passive warming, not controlled. Start 09-09-2020, 12:00 (27¬∞C).\n\t- Toor dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total inucubation time: **44h**.\n\t- Chana dal: Total incubation time (in cupboard): **44h**.\n\t- Green mung dal: Move to room temperature after 23h, total incubation time: **48h**.\n\n### Chana dal\nSlower to colonise than the others, so left in cupboard for much longer. More and bigger holes made, because it was wet inside the plastic bag. `Needs to be dried off better!` Nice dense, fluffy mycelium, no spores. Slightly sour and damp smell.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133616.png]]\n\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133323.png]]\n\n### Toor dal\nGood colonisation, got warm quickly (32¬∞C). At the end, a bit wet and slightly yeasty, alcoholic smell. More mycelium on the sides than in the middle, but nicely colonised through and through. Tiny spores in one corner.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133655.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133718.png]]\n\n### Green mung dal\nGood initial colonisation, taken out after 23h at 34¬∞C. Mycelium took longer to get dense. At the end, very strong, sharp alcoholic smell. Not well grown in the middle. No spores visible. Doesn't smell pleasant at all. `Too small grains! It gets too dense and wet. Mix with something bigger.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220527133913.png]]\n\n\n## Different Swedish legumes/grains (2020-09-19)\n\n_Test: Gula √§rtor (yellow peas), Gotland linser (lentils from Gotland), Lins Anicia (lentil Anicia), Favab√∂nor (fava beans, dehulled), bruna b√∂nor (brown beans), vit quinoa (white quinoa), compare to Toor dal._\n\n- Material: **Legumes** from FRAM, Gothenburg. 125 g dry legumes/grains each.\n- Soaking and cooking (until al dente):\n\t1. Yellow peas: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. Nice texture, grassy taste. Dehulling was a pain and there were weird peas that didn't get soft (~1%).\n\t2. Gotland lentils: **No soaking**. Cook for **12 min**. Nicely separated. Very good, fresh, chestnutty taste.\n\t3. Lentil Anicia: **No soaking**. Cook for **5 min**. Slightly tougher than Gotland linser, but also pleasant nutty taste.\n\t4. Fava beans: **Soak over night**, cook for **5 min**. Starchy, not a strong bean taste.\n\t5. Brown beans: **Soak over night**, dehull, boil for **18 min** `‚Äî\u003e much too long! Very mushy!` Starchy, clean taste. Dehulling was a pain, quite tough shell.\n\t6. White quinoa: **No soaking**. Rinse very thoroughly and cook for **9 min** in a lot of water. Fluffy and nice pop, slightly bitter, earthy taste, very voluminous.\n\t7. Toor dal: **Soak over night**, cook for **10 min**. \n\n- Inoculation: Drain, add 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (**4 Tbsp/kg**), mix and heat up in dry pan to remove moisture. Spread on clean tea towel and let dry a bit. Mix in a tub thoroughly with 1/4 tsp (**2 tsp/kg**) starter (_topcultures_). \n- Growth: \n\t- Open: Prepare 7 portions in plastic or glass jars for open incubation in sous vide immersion water bath, set to **32¬∞C** water temperature (=\"open\"). Incubation start, 19-09-2020, 21:00. Sous vide immersion cooker is very loud, but temperature in water bath was very even. Water bath shut off 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\t- Plastic: Prepare 7 bigger portions in perforated plastic bags for incubation above freezer (27¬∞C at the start) (=\"plastic\"). In the cupboard the temperature was varied, but once the mycelium started to take over it got VERY warm in some samples (35-43¬∞C!!). Bags put at room temperature 22-09-2020, 8:00, for another 5 h. **Total incubation time: 40h**. Store in fridge for **2 days.**\n\nResults:\n1. **Yellow peas**: Smell is quite mild, slightly mushroomy. Open: Very nice, dense little block with thick mycelium all around. Not too fluffy on top, little sporulation, mild smell. Plastic: Block is nicely dense, but a bit irregular because the peas are quite big and the bag was lying on a rack. Both: Nice to cut, but slightly fragile due to size of beans `‚Äî\u003e maybe chop a little bit before mixing with the starter?` Looks good, basically like toor dal tempeh. But a few harder peas are visible in the mix. Interesting to see how they will be when cooked/fried.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528094941.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095009.png]]\n\n2. **Gotland lentils**: Open: Very fluffy on the top and a tiny bit sporulation. Black colour is visible underneath, but that's from the lentils, not spores. Plastic: Quite dense block, no wet or empty bits. Nice to cut and looks very pretty, but the lentils start falling out of the block a bit. When boiled, quite many lentils fall out, leaving small holes in the block. Not holding together as well as e.g. brown beans. Quite brittle after boiling `‚Äî\u003e mix lentils with something else!` Both: Slightly unpleasant dank smell, similar to the quinoa samples.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095038.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095058.png]]\n\n3. **Lentils Anicia**: Didn't develop mycelium at all, neither in bag nor in cup, and also not after \u003e 48h incubation. Discarded. `‚Äî\u003e Too tough outer shell, or did I forget the starter?`\n\n4. **Fava beans**: Slightly cheesy smell. Plastic: Bit wet and some bigger beans are exposed and touching the plastic and they got sticky-shiny and smell cheesy `‚Äî\u003e dry the beans better next time and cook less!` Cut structure is not bad, but there are wet beans visible that turned brown and funky. Throw away. Open: Irregular surface of beans with some fluffy mycelium growing up, some sporulation. When cut quite crumbly, because beans are quite big. Spores are also inside, probably because of air pockets `‚Äî\u003e press better together and maybe cover with something. Also chop a bit smaller next time.` Smell of open sample not unpleasant, so the smell comes really from the exposed beans-on-wet-plastic in the plastic bag sample.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095210.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095234.png]]\n\n5. **Brown beans**: Plastic: Nice very white, dense block. Slight ammonia smell! Or slightly sour smell Not as unpleasant as the lentils and the quinoa. Smells fresher. Open: No ammonia smell, just fresh, almost grassy. Beans are a bit loose and irregular on the top, mycelium fluffy but no spores. Both: No unpleasant smell inside when cut at all. Very mild and neutral. Beans are very white. Good block, holding together well. Not wet, no air pockets.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095320.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095914.png]]\n\n6. **White quinoa**: Got the hottest and developed mycelium the fastest. The open incubation even started sporulating (not the case for any other substrates). Plastic: Big non-mycelium spot in the middle with unpleasant smell and colour. It's sticky and slimy ‚Äî\u003e remove! `‚Äî\u003e Dry the grains more and mix with something bigger to avoid too dense cake.` The nice parts have a slighly animal and rotten smell, not entirely pleasant. Nice dense cake in most parts, but e.g. the corners of the plastic bag are not as dense and a bit wet and smell more sharp (ethanol, ammonia). Open: Nice, dense cake, but a lot of fluffy, sporulating mycelium on top `‚Äî\u003e incubate for a shorter time!` Smell of open is less unpleasant and more mushroomy than the plastic bag `‚Äî\u003e Maybe quinoa needs a LOT of air.`\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095423.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095440.png]]\n\n7. **Toor dal**: Plastic. Very nice dense cake with thick, smooth, white mycelium all around. Open: Fluffy top with slight sporulation, otherwise similar density to plastic. Both: Smells of almost nothing, very mild. Nice mycelium throughout, no wet or non-grown spots. Perfect tempeh.\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095558.png]]\n![[projects/attachments/Pasted image 20220528095616.png]]\n\n\n\n## Fava beans + additions (2020-09-30)\n_Test: Addition of things that give more texture to Fava bean tempeh: Sunflower seeds, sesame seeds._\n\nRecipe from [tempeh.info](http://tempeh.info): Soy+sunflower seeds: normal soy tempeh, but substitute 100-200 g of beans with sunflower seeds.

At lower temperatures: more proteases, at higher temperatures: more amylases.\n\nRelative humidity: 90% Spray with water if necessary\n\nSubstrate: rice, barley, soy, wheat etc. Substrate shouldn't be wet after cooking, but rather dry. Best is steaming (unless for shoyu, then cooking is better).\n\nAfter inoculation, stir for the first time after 24h, then every 4 hours or so.\n\nRice koji can be ready after 40 h, barley koji can take up to 50 h.

Cook (steam) rice to al dente consistency, then spread out into casserole for cooling. \n2. Toast the flour in a pan for 5 min, cool down. When flour is cooled, mix koji spores in. When rice is below 40C, mix koji flour in.\n3. Cover dish with plastic wrap (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n4. Incubate at 30C. Check internal temperature every few hours, should be 27-35C.\n5. After 24h, sweet smell. Check temperature. Stir and break up lumps. Make furrows to dissipate heat.\n6. After around **40 h in total**, rice koji is ready.\n\n\n### Oat koji\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\nLike rice koji, but use 3 cups of oat groats instead. Soak groats for 6-8h, then steam until al dente. Follow the rice koji instructions.\n\nNice oatmeal cookie smell when done.\n\n\n### Barley koji\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\nMore prone to overheating! Nutty chestnut aroma when done. Will look less fuzzy than rice koji.\n\n- 1225 g pearled barley\n- 35 g wheat or rice flour\n- 2 g (2 tsp) koji starter\n\n1. Soak barley 6-8 h, drain and rinse. Steam for 1.5 hours or boil for 1h. Barley is done when the kernels are soft all the way through but not mushy. Drain and spread out on a drain to cool to below 40C.\n2. Toast the flour for 5 min, cool down. Add koji spores to cooled flour, mix well. \n3. Sprinkle koji flour on barley, mix very well.\n4. Put everything into a deep dish, cover with cling film (+ holes) or moistened cheese cloth.\n5. Incubate at 30C, check internal temperature every few hours (should be 27-35C).\n6. After 24-36h, surface growth and sweet, mushroomy smell. Monitor heat closely, stir and break up lumps, make furrows to dissipate heat. Adjust moisture if needed.\n7. After about **40 h total**, incubation is done.\n\n\n## Shoyus and aminos\n### Soy-wheat shoyu\nFrom [https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/](https://www.fermentationculture.eu/how-to-make-soy-sauce/):\n\nTraditional recipe: wheat berries/matvete (from soft wheat, not durum)= whole wheat kernel with bran, germ, endosperm but without the husk + soy beans.\nVariations: Use oats or barley instead of wheat, and lentils or chickpeas instead of soy beans.\n\n#### Ratio soy:wheat (legumes:grains): \n- Traditional **1 part dry soy, 1 part dry wheat** (by weight). \n- A bit more wheat: 1 part soaked soy, 1 part dry wheat. _The less wheat you use, the longer the sauce will have to ferment._\n\n#### Preparation:\n1. **Roast** the wheat berries in the oven until they are golden brown. Mill them in something like a coffee grinder on the coarsest setting or a food processor.\n2. **Soak** soy beans over night. (Soy beans will increase 2.3X when soaked, so calculate how much dry beans to use!)\n3. **Cook** soy beans for at least 40 min, until you can easily squeeze them between your fingers. Strain them and let steam a bit.\n4. **Mix** the steamy beans with the milled wheat (so the dry wheat soaks up the excess moisture). If it seems too wet, add more wheat. If it's too dry, spray some water onto it, or add more beans (if you have). Crush some of the soy beans with your hands.\n\n#### Inoculation:\n1. Dilute the spores, so they are easier to handle, with some flour.\n2. Check that **soybean/wheat mixture** has cooled down to below 40C. Spread spores over the mixture (e.g. with a tea strainer). Mix well.\n3. Line a pyrex dish with damp piece of cloth. Spread your mix into the dish. Cover with another moistened cloth. Put cling film over the dish, poke some holes in.\n4. Incubate (at **30C**) and keep a close eye on the temperature inside the koji, it can overheat very easily.\n5. After 24h, stir the mixture. Moisten the top cloth again if necessary. Put cling film back on and continue incubation. If koji overheats (\u003e37C) a lot, you have to stir a lot. Spread out in a thinner layer and turn off oven!\n6. After another 12h (**36h in total**) you should see a lot of growth. It shouldn't sporulate, but it's not the worst if it does a bit.\n\n#### Fermentation:\n1. Prepare a **15% brine**: 150 g of uniodised salt + 850 g of water. (You'll need about 1.65x the dry ingredients weight in brine weight).\n2. Clean your fermentation vessel well and pour in the koji.\n3. Pour the brine over the koji until the koji is covered. Let it soak for 1-2h. Pour some more brine until koji is covered again. Stir. You might have to add more brine over the next few days to keep the koji covered.\n4. Optional: Stir in a few tea spoons of unpasteurised miso to introduce beneficial bacteria.\n5. During the first **2-3 weeks, stir daily**. A lot of gas will be produced during that time that carry up solids to the surface. Push them down again so they don't get mouldy.\n6. Once your shoyu has settled down and is less active, reduce stirring to once every other day.\n\n#### Pressing:\nAfter **3-12 months**, put a cheese cloth into a sieve or colander, pour the fermentation mash in, cover with a cloth and put a weight on top. Let press over night. (Or use a cider press if you have one).\n\n#### Bottling:\n1. Clean bottles well, sterilise in oven (cover with aluminium foil, keep at 160C for at least 30 min, let cool down over night). Boil bottle caps in water.\n2. Heat the shoyu to 90C to kill off moulds and bacteria, but don't boil it! Pour the shoyu into the bottles and cap.\n\n\n### Bread aminos\nFrom [Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey)](Miso, Natto, Tempeh (Shockey))\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 680 g bread\n- 70 g all purpose or rice flour\n- 1 g (1 tsp) koji starter\n- 1.9 L water\n- 100 g for a 5% salt solution or 165 g for a 8% salt solution\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.\n2. Toast the flour in a pan over medium heat until slightly browned (5 min). Remove and let cool, then combine with koji spores.\n3. Mix koji-flour with bread cubes. Distribute very well.\n4. Transfer the inoculated bread to a casserole dish, cover with cling film and poke a few holes in.\n5. Set incubator to **30C** and place the pan in there. Check the internal temperature every few hours, it **should be 27-35C**.\n6. After 20-24h, you should notice a sweet smell. Stir the bread pieces, then continue to incubate for another 20-30h.\n7. When the koji is done, place everything into a glass jar. Boil the water with the salt and cool down to below 50C. Pour the brine onto the bread koji and mix thoroughly.\n8. Seal the jar with a lid and let sit at warm RT (27-29C) for 24h. Stir a few times during.\n9. Let mixture sit at regular RT for a week. Open the jar to release gases, stir at least once a day. After a week, the ferment should have settled down. When it's no longer active, seal the container and let it **age at RT for at least 6 months**.\n10. When you're ready to use the amino sauce, strain out the bread solids (or blend into a thicker sauce). Use the liquid for seasoning. Store in the fridge (because of low salt content).\n\n### Oat residue aminos\nAdapted from bread aminos (Shockey recipe) \nMade 2021-10-16 [Oat residue aminos](Oat residue aminos)\n\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 430 g dried oat residues (dried in oven at 50C for a day, from 1 kg fresh oat residue)\n- 44 g rice flour\n- 1 tsp **barley koji starter** (LUVI Ferments)\n- 1.2 L water\n- 63 g uniodised salt\n- 1 Tbsp seed miso\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. Toast rice flour. Cool down to below 40C, then add about 1/5 of one bag of barley koji starter (whole bag is for 5 kg substrate).\n2. Disinfect a big bowl with Starsan and add the dried oat residues. _It feels rubbery, but not quite damp enough, so carefully add a little bit of water. Add 70 g of water and mix thoroughly with hands. Feels like a good dampness now._\n3. Mix in the flour koji starter with a tea strainer. Mix very thoroughly. _Oats feel quite dry again due to the flour, so add 100 g more water and mix._\n4. Pack into a Pyrex dish lined with a damp tea towel. Cover the oats with the tea towel, stick a thermometer in and cover with cling film + holes.\n5. Incubate at around **30C** until koji has grown nicely, but not sporulated (approx. **48h**).\n6. Place oat koji into a bowl, pour the (cooled down) brine onto it and mix throughly. Place in a large glass jar and leave at RT, stir occassionally for the next 2 weeks. _Mould forms on top over and over again, which looks exactly like koji mould ‚Äî\u003e remove regularly and try to weigh down the solids to keep everything submerged (it‚Äôs hard, since the oat residue is very fine)._\n7. After about 2 weeks at RT in the open glass jar, divide between small plastic tubs with screw-top lids, fill completely to the brim and seal. Now leave at RT for up to 12 months.\n8.

Wash cabbage, then remove trunk and cut the leaves into rough pieces (approx. 3x3 cm).\n2. Wash the daikon and cut into little sticks. \n3. Wash the spring onions, chop roughly and set aside. \n4. Place cabbage leaves, daikon and green parts of the spring onions into a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp flaky sea salt. Toss to combine and work in a bit with your hands. Cover with a plate or tea towel, then let sit at room temperature until cabbage is wilted (min. 1h, better up to 12h). The cabbage will release some liquid. \n5. Combine white parts of spring onion, minced garlic, finely chopped ginger, chili flakes, miso paste and sugar in a blender or food processor. Start pulsing to combine everything. Slowly add water to get to the right pasty consistency for it to blend properly (approx. 1 cup). Blend this past about 30 sec, scraping down the sides to not have too big chunks. \n6. Add the chili paste to the wilted cabbage and mix well with a spoon. \n7. Prepare glass jars by pouring boiling water into them and leaving to soak for a bit. Empty the jars and let cool down. \n8. Fill the cabbage-chili mixture into the jars, pressing down firmly with a spoon or chop stick to pack it tightly and not leave any air pockets. Make sure the top is covered with some of the liquid. \n9. Close jars and leave at room temperature for 24h. Then transfer to fridge and allow to ferment for at least 3 weeks before eating.  \n\nIt will not develop much CO2, so it's actually ok to close the jar tightly. I still air it from time to time during the first days and weeks, when I think about it. \n\nIt will last forever in the fridge and just get more sour and softer.

Acidity is very mild (milder than 053), no off-flavours sticking out. **Silfa's favourite**. \n- Soy 053: Quite runny, similar to dairy 053, though a bit more watery (might be also due to the lower fat). Too sour, very strong single acidity that reminds of red currant and tingles on the tongue. Fruity notes, vanilla. \n- Soy 092: Quite runny, very similar to soy 053. Missing the body of dairy 092. Strong vanilla note and quite strong acidity. Some undefinable off-notes. Duncan thinks it's pretty bad tasting.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a few days in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 053: Soft and good body, a bit watery. Just plops off a spoon. Quite acidic and quite clean acidity. No off notes.\n- Dairy 092: Thick and gloopy, almost a bit stretchy. Drips off a spoon in a slightly viscous way. Very good almost buttery taste and fine acidity (not overwhelming). Still Silfa's favourite. \n- Soy 053: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Quite runny texture. Very sour and quite a one-note, clean acidity, bit fizzy on the tongue. Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Not much body (neither in texture nor in taste). A bit too sour for me to eat/enjoy. Duncan thinks it has similar sourness to fil, but needs more body/thickness.\n- Soy 092: Bit of syneresis and looks a bit feathered (though gets better again once stirred). Clear vanilla note (might be that specific soy milk). Quite runny texture, but also a tiny bit viscous. Sour, but also a mild/buttery note. Has more body in flavour than 092, better. Duncan likes this better, mostly because of the vanilla note.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Find higher fat soy milk? \n- Test same cultures with oat milk\n- Test different cultures and compare\n- Some time in between would probably be good, e.g. 10h at 40¬∞C.\n\n### Vege011 and √ñresunds fil starter cultures\n_2022-06-16_\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 01**, **√ñresunds fil (Sk√•nemejerier)**\n\nSubstrates: Fresh dairy milk (3% fat), Alpro soy milk (1.8% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milks to approx. 90¬∞C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: \n- Freeze-dried culture: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (approx. 1/8 tsp) into 25 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 5 mL of that to inoculate each jar (of about 200 mL).\n- Store-bought fil: Take 1/2 Tbsp of fil and stir into each jar (of about 200 mL) = **1/4 Tbsp/100 mL**. \n\n**1st fermentation**: **8h, 40¬∞C** (in the rice cooker)\n\nAfter 3h, the fil-inoculated soy and dairy milks already firmed up and started to get sour, while the Vege011 milks were still liquid and sweet. \n\nAfter 6h, the fil-inoculated firmed up even more, Vege011 were getting a little bit thicker.\n\nAfter 8h: fil-inoculated firmed up a lot in both soy and dairy. Vege011 have soft yogurt consistency.\n\n**Tasting at room temperature**\n- Dairy 011: Quite loose structure. Not very sour but nice taste.\n- Soy 011: Quite loose structure, looser than dairy 011. Not sour, quite sweet actually and very vanilla-y.\n- Dairy fil: Good stable gel-structure and very nice sourness. But not so nice to taste warm.\n- Soy fil: Firmness in between Dairy fil and Dairy 011. Not as sour as dairy fil but pleasant. Very vanilla-y.\n\n**Tasting cold (after a day in the fridge)**\n- Dairy 011: Smells very animaly/milky. Has firmed up a lot and holds shape on spoon. Mellow acidity, bit funky. Very pleasant. Slight cheesiness maybe. Great texture, almost like stirred yogurt from the start. Much denser than the soy yogurts. When stirred it becomes very homogenous and smooth, with a bit of a gloopy, viscous texture that slowly drips off a spoon. Duncan: texture is better, but taste is not much better than the soy gurts. \n- Soy 011: Smells like vanilla yogurt. Wobbly-gelly. Very loose, runny structure. Taste is very nice. Not really sour, but the sweetness of the soy milk has disappeared and it's quite neutral with a nice vanilla note. When stirred, it's very runny and looks almost like custard. Curdles a bit. Very refreshing taste. Duncan found it watery, but after adding a bit of salt it tasted much better.\n- Dairy fil: Smells a bit lemony. Great taste, very pleasant. Rich taste, mellow acidity, no off flavours. Texture is quite firm, stays on spoon. But when stirred it becomes nicely soft and smooth, even a bit thinner than dairy 011 and a bit less viscous. Duncan: could still have more acidity, but nice taste.\n- Soy fil: Smells less like vanilla and more a bit animaly/milky. A bit more sour than soy 011, but also not very strong. Very nice acidity level actually. Vanilla aroma is not overwhelming, but present. Texture is like a loose gel. When stirred, it gets almost gloopy. More homogeneous texture than soy 011, very smooth. Clean taste. Duncan thinks it should be more acidic.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Dairy 011 and dairy fil are quite similar in taste, texture and acidity level. Dairy 011 is a bit more mouth-filling and viscous, maybe some bacteria that make exopolysaccharides?\n- Soy011 is too loose and thin. Try fermenting longer? \n- Soy fil worked really well, but could also benefit from a bit longer fermentation.\n- The vanilla taste in the soy milk is a bit much, try to find another plant milk to test.\n- Salt improves taste of soy yogurts. \n\n## Oat\n_2022-05-06\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 053**, **Vege 092**\n\nSubstrates: Oatly chilled mellan (1.5% fat)\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up milk to approx. 90¬∞C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (fraction of 1/4 tsp) into 10 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 1.5 mL of that to inoculate each jar.\n\n**1st fermentation**: **8h, 40¬∞C** (in the rice cooker)\n\nNot very thick texture, so leave for a few more hours. After that it got semi-thick and pleasantly sour, but not great. \n\n_Try again with some starch addition._\n\n## Pea\n_2022-05\n\nStarter cultures: **Vege 053**, **Vege 092**\n\nSubstrates: Sproud pea drink\n\n**Scalding**: Heat up to approx. 90¬∞C on the stove, leave for a minute, then pour into prepared jars and cool down in a water bath.\n\n**Starter culture**: Pour a bit of the freeze-dried starter culture (fraction of 1/4 tsp) into 10 mL of water, shake. Use approx. 1.5 mL of that to inoculate each jar.\n\n**1st fermentation**: **8h, 40¬∞C** (in the rice cooker)\n\nNo thickening at all. Leave for another 8h at 40¬∞C. Still no thickening at all. Slightly sour taste, but not very pleasant.\n\n_Complete failure, not suitable for yogurt making.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/fennel_mint_lemon":{"title":"Fennel with mint and lemon","content":"\n![](projects/attachments/Fermented%20fennel%20with%20lemon%20and%20mint.jpg)\n\nRecipe: [Vegetable recipes - Fennel with mint and lemon](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Fennel%20with%20mint%20and%20lemon)\n\n_2022-07-25:_\n\n- 2 days: No cloudiness yet.

Maybe just with bread and sausage, for example? Fennel pieces are crunchy, but also got soft, bit chewy. Neither lemon nor mint seemed to have had much impact on taste (uness the bitterness comes from the lemon, in which case it had a negative impact).\n\nAfter 2 weeks in the fridge, the anise taste has mellowed out a bit and the acidity has increased nicely. **7 days was a good time to get it nicely sour, but still keep crunchiness**. \n\n![](projects/attachments/Fennel.jpeg)","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/fermentation_main":{"title":"Fermentation projects","content":"\n### Vegetables fermentations\n\n[Vegetable recipes](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md)\n\n[Fermented vegetable production](projects/fermentation/Fermented%20vegetable%20production.md)\n\n\n### Dairy- and plant-based milk fermentations\n[[Yogurt recipes]]\n\n[[Yogurt production]]\n\n\n### Tempeh\n[[Tempeh recipes]]\n\n[Tempeh experiments](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20experiments.md)\n\n[Tempeh links](projects/fermentation/Tempeh%20links.md)\n\n\n### Koji, shoyu, aminos\n\n[Koji recipes](projects/fermentation/Koji%20recipes.md)\n\n[Koji production](Koji%20production)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T18:25:59.924375218Z","tags":null},"/projects/fermentation/fermented_carrot_parsley":{"title":"Fermented carrot and parsley root","content":"\n![[projects/attachments/Screenshot 2022-06-10 at 20.07.38.png]]\nRecipe: [Vegetable recipes - Vietnamese pickled carrot and daikon](projects/fermentation/Vegetable%20recipes.md#Vietnamese%20pickled%20carrot%20and%20daikon)\n\n_2022-03:_\n\nMade with **parsley root** instead of daikon. \nTastes really nice and no problems with fungi or yeasts during incubation.

Also, it smelled really bad (sulfurous) throughout the fermentation, sometimes worse sometimes less bad. Was considering leaving some out a bit longer to see how the fermentation progresses, but I'm a bit sick of the smell. Will probably ferment a bit further in the fridge anyway.  \n\nAfter 1-2 weeks in the fridge, the liquid has got clear (though it's still fizzing and bubbling a bit) and the bitterness has mellowed out.
